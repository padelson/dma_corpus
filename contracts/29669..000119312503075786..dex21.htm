v _COMBINATION AGREEMENT_



COMBINATION AGREEMENT (hereinafter called this _" _Agreement_ ")_, dated as of
November 8, 2003, between R.R. Donnelley and Sons Company, a Delaware
corporation ( _" _Parent_ "_), and Moore Wallace Incorporated, a corporation
continued under the laws of Canada (the _" _Company_ "_).





_RECITALS_



WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent and the Company believes
that a business combination between the Company and Parent is in the best
interests of Parents stockholders and the Companys shareholders,
respectively;



WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent and the Company has
deemed it advisable and in the best interests of its stockholders, in the
case of Parent, and shareholders and holders of outstanding Company Options
and Company RSUs (each as defined in _Section 2.1(b)(iii)_ ), in the case of
the Company, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
to effect the business combination provided for herein in which a direct,
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent acquires all of the outstanding common
shares of the Company (the _" _Company Common Shares_ "_) pursuant to the
Plan of Arrangement (as defined in _Section 1.1(a)_ );



WHEREAS, in furtherance of such combination, (i) the Board of Directors of
each of Parent and the Company has approved the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) the Company has agreed (A) to submit a special
resolution, substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto (the _"
_Arrangement Resolution_ "_), to the holders of the Company Common Shares
(the  _" _Company Common Shareholders_ "_) and the holders of outstanding
Company Options and Company RSUs, voting together as a class, for approval,
and (B) to submit the Plan of Arrangement (as defined in _Section 1.1(a)_ ) to
the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (the _" _Court_ "_) for approval, and
(iii) Parent has agreed to submit proposals to the holders of shares of Parent
Common Stock (the " _ _Parent Common Stockholders_ "_) to approve (A) the
issuance of the shares of common stock, par value $1.25 per share, of Parent
(the _" _Parent Common Stock_ "_) to be issued upon consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement (the
_" _Share Issuance Proposal_ "_) and (B) the Benefit Plan Proposal (as defined
in Section 3.5(f)) (the Share Issuance Proposal and the Benefit Plan Proposal
collectively being referred to as the " _ _Parent Proposals__ "); and



WHEREAS, Parent and the Company intend that for United States federal income
tax purposes the acquisition of the Company Common Shares pursuant to the Plan
of Arrangement will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the _" _Code_ "_).

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:





ARTICLE I



GENERAL



1.1. _Implementation Steps by the Company_.



(a) As promptly as practicable after the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the _" _SEC_ "_) has informed Parent and the Company that
it has no further comments with respect to or will not review ( _"
_SEC Clearance_ "_) the preliminary Joint Proxy Statement (as defined in
_Section 1.5(a)_ ), the Company will apply, in a manner reasonably acceptable
to Parent, to the Court under Section 192 of the Canada Business Corporations
Act (the " _ _CBCA__ ") for an order approving the arrangement (the _"
_Arrangement_ ")_ on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the
plan of arrangement (the _" _Plan of Arrangement_ "_) substantially in the
form of _Exhibit B_ hereto (as such order may be amended or varied at any time
prior to the Effective Time or, if appealed, then unless such appeal is
withdrawn or denied, as affirmed or as amended on appeal at the direction of
the Court, the _" _Final Order_ "_), and for an interim order of the Court, as
the same may be amended (the _" _Interim Order_ "_), in respect of the
Arrangement, as contemplated by _Section 1.3_ , and thereafter proceed with
and diligently seek the Interim Order.



(b) The Company shall, subject to obtaining the Interim Order and in the
manner contemplated by _Section 3.4_ , convene and hold a special meeting of
the Company Common Shareholders (the _" _Company Meeting_ "_), including any
adjournment or postponement thereof, to be called and held in accordance with
the Interim Order to consider the Arrangement (and for any other proper
purpose as may be set out in the notice for such meeting, including as set
forth in Section 1.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter (as defined in
_Section 2.1_ ) and agreed to by Parent).



(c) The Company shall, subject to obtaining the approvals as are required by
the Interim Order, proceed with and diligently pursue the application to
the Court for the Final Order approving the Arrangement.



(d) The Company shall, subject to obtaining the Final Order and the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article IV_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), send to the Director
appointed pursuant to Section 260 of the CBCA (the _" _Director_ "_), for
endorsement and filing by the Director, the articles of arrangement (the _"
_Articles of Arrangement_ ") _and such other documents as may be required in
connection therewith under the CBCA to give effect to the Arrangement.



 

2 1.2. _Implementation Steps by Parent_.



(a) Parent shall, as promptly as practicable after SEC Clearance and the
Company obtains the Interim Order and in the manner contemplated by _Section
3.4_ , convene and hold a meeting of the Parent Common Stockholders with
respect to the Parent Proposals (the _" _Parent Meeting_ "_), including any
adjournment or postponement thereof (and for any other proper purpose as may
be set out in the notice for such meeting and agreed to by the Company).



(b) Parent shall form and organize a direct, wholly owned subsidiary organized
under the laws of Canada or any province thereof which will acquire
the Company Common Shares in exchange for delivery of shares of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to the Arrangement.



1.3. _Interim Order_. The notice of motion for the application referred to in
_Section 1.1(a)_ shall request that the Interim Order provide: 



(a) for the class of persons to whom notice is to be provided in respect of
the Arrangement and the Company Meeting and for the manner in which such
notice is to be provided;



(b) that the requisite approval for the Arrangement Resolution shall be 66
2/3% of the votes cast on the Arrangement Resolution by Company Common
Shareholders and holders of Company Options and Company RSUs, voting together
as a class, present in person or represented by proxy at the Company Meeting
(such that each Company Common Shareholder is entitled to one vote for each
Company Common Share held and each holder of Company Options and Company RSUs
is entitled to one vote for each Company Common Share or Company RSU, as the
case may be, that such holder would have received on a valid exercise of such
holders Company Options or Company RSUs, as the case may be);



(c) that, in all other respects, the terms, restrictions and conditions of the
Organizational Documents (as defined in  _Section 2.1(a)_ ) of the Company,
including quorum requirements and all other matters, shall apply in respect of
the Company Meeting; and



(d) for the grant of the rights of dissent in respect of the Arrangement
described in Article 3 of the Plan of Arrangement (the _" _Dissent Rights_
"_).



1.4. _Articles of Arrangement_. The Articles of Arrangement shall, with such
other matters as are necessary to effect the Arrangement, implement the Plan
of Arrangement.



1.5. _Joint Proxy Statement; S-8 Registration Statement_. (a) As promptly as
practicable after execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent and the
Company shall cooperate in preparing and cause to be filed with the SEC a
mutually



 

3 acceptable joint management information circular and proxy statement (such
joint management information circular and proxy statement and any amendments
or supplements thereto, the _" _Joint Proxy Statement_ "_), together with any
other documents required by the United States Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the _" _Securities Act_ "_), the United States Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the _" _Exchange Act_ "_), the Securities Act
(Ontario) and the rules, regulations and policies made thereunder, as amended
(the _" _Ontario Securities Act_ "_), or other applicable Laws in connection
with the Arrangement and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Joint Proxy Statement shall constitute (i) the management
information circular of the Company (the _" _Company Circular_ "_) with
respect to the Company Meeting and (ii) the proxy statement of Parent with
respect to the Parent Meeting. Each of Parent and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain promptly SEC Clearance of the Joint Proxy
Statement. As promptly as practicable after Parent and the Company receive SEC
Clearance with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement and the Company receives
the Interim Order, each of Parent and the Company shall cause the Joint Proxy
Statement and any other documentation required in connection with the Parent
Meeting or the Company Meeting, as the case may be, to be sent to each Parent
Common Stockholder, Company Common Shareholder and holder of Company
Options and Company RSUs, as the case may be, entitled to vote at the Parent
Meeting or the Company Meeting and filed as required by the Interim Order and
applicable Laws.



(b) Each party shall promptly furnish to the other party all information
concerning such party and its securityholders as may be reasonably required
in connection with any action contemplated by this _Section 1.5_ , including
any information required to be included in the Joint Proxy Statement. The
Joint Proxy Statement shall comply in all material respects with all
applicable Law and any requirements of the Interim Order. Each of Parent and
the Company will, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide
each other with copies of written comments and advise the other party of any
oral comments with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement received from the SEC
or the Court and of any request by the SEC or the Court for amendments or
supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement or their respective historical SEC
filings or for additional information. Each of Parent and the Company shall
cooperate and provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any correspondence with the SEC with respect to the Joint Proxy
Statement and any amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement prior
to providing or filing such, as the case may be, with the SEC and will
promptly provide the other party with a copy of all such correspondence or
filings made with the SEC. If at any time prior to the Parent Meeting or the
Company Meeting any information relating to Parent or the Company, or their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent
or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Joint Proxy Statement so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party and, to the
extent required by Law, (i) an appropriate amendment to the Interim Order
shall be



 

4 sought and (ii) subject to obtaining the amendment in the preceding clause
(i), an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly filed with the SEC and sent to each Parent Common Stockholder,
Company Common Shareholder and holder of Company Options and Company RSUs
entitled to vote at the Parent Meeting or the Company Meeting, as the case
may be.



(c) Promptly after the Effective Time (as defined in the Plan of
Arrangement), Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (the _"
_S-8 Registration Statement_ "_) with the SEC to register (i) the Parent
Common Stock to be issued from time to time after the Effective Time upon
exercise of Company Options, upon delivery of Parent Common Stock underlying
Company RSUs assumed by Parent or upon exercise of options issued in exchange
for Company Options pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Plan of
Arrangement and (ii) the Parent Common Stock that is issued pursuant to the
conversion of the Company Restricted Shares (as defined in _Section
2.1(b)(iii)_ ) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Plan of
Arrangement. Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of the S-8 Registration Statement for so long as any Company
Options, or options issued in exchange therefor, remain outstanding or, in
each case, until such earlier time as Parent determines to be sufficient on
the written advice of its outside legal counsel.



(d) Parent and the Company shall take any action required to be taken under
any applicable provincial, territorial or state securities Laws (including
"blue sky" Laws) in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock and
the Arrangement; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor the Company
shall be required by reason of the foregoing to register or qualify as a
foreign corporation or reporting issuer in any jurisdiction where either
Parent or the Company is not now so registered or qualified.



1.6. _Exchange Ratio_. (a) As used herein, the term _" _Exchange Ratio_ "_
means 0.63 of a share of Parent Common Stock, including the corresponding
percentage of a Parent Right (as defined in _Section 2.2(b)(ii)(B)_ ), to be
delivered upon the transfer of each Company Common Share to a direct, wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent, pursuant to Section 2.2 of the Plan of
Arrangement. All references in this Agreement to Parent Common Stock to
be received in accordance with the Plan of Arrangement shall be deemed, from
and after the Effective Time, to include the associated Parent Rights.



(b) Except as set forth in Section 1.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, if
the Company changes the number of Company Common Shares or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Company Common
Shares, or Parent changes the number of shares of Parent Common Stock or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Parent Common Stock, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including reverse split), dividend
or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, combination, issuer
tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio
will be adjusted appropriately to provide the holders of Company Common Shares
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement and the Plan of



 

5 Arrangement prior to such reclassification, split, dividend, distribution,
recapitalization, merger, subdivision, combination, tender or exchange offer
or similar transaction.



1.7. _Dissenting Shareholders_. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt
notice of any written notice exercising Dissent Rights, withdrawals of the
exercise of such rights, and any other instruments served pursuant to the CBCA
and received by the Company in connection with the Arrangement or the Company
Meeting and (b) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to the exercise of such Dissent Rights to the extent
that the Company is proposing to make any payments to such Company Common
Shareholders. Without the prior written consent of Parent, except as required
by applicable Law, the Company shall not make any payment prior to the
Effective Time with respect to any such rights or offer to settle or settle
any such rights.

resale of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to the Arrangement without
qualification with or approval of or the filing of any prospectus, or the
taking of any proceeding with, or the obtaining of any further order, ruling
or consent from any Governmental Entity (as defined in _Section 2.1(d)(i)(G)_
) under any Canadian federal, provincial or territorial securities or other
Laws or pursuant to the rules and regulations of any Governmental Entity
administering such Laws, or the fulfillment of any other legal requirement in
any such jurisdiction (other than, with respect to such first resales, any
restrictions or transfer by reason of, among other things, a holder being a
"control person" of Parent for purposes of Canadian federal, provincial or
territorial securities Laws).



1.10. _Closing_. The closing of the Arrangement and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (the _" _Closing_ "_) shall take place (i) at the offices
of Osler, Hoskin and Harcourt LLP, 100 King Street West, Toronto, Ontario M5X1B8
on the third business day after which the last to be fulfilled or waived of
the conditions set forth in _Article IV_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to fulfillment or
waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with
this Agreement or (ii) at such other place and time and/or on such other date
as the Company and Parent may agree in writing (the _" _Closing Date_ "_).





ARTICLE II __

properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and
is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation
in each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, or to
have such power or authority when taken together with all other such
failures, would not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect (as defined in _Section 6.10_ ) or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of the Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement. The Company
has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the certificate

Subsidiaries Organizational Documents so made available are in full force and
effect. Section 2.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and

awarded any restricted stock units or restricted shares.



(iv) Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities
of each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued,

accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_ , there are no preemptive or other
outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation
rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls,
commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities or
obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any
Person (as defined in _Section 6.10_ ) a right to subscribe for or acquire,
any securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities
or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding.

8 (viii) No holders of securities issued by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries have any right to compel the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to register or otherwise qualify such securities for public sale in Canada or
the United States.



(c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_. (i) The Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate
action necessary in order to execute and deliver this Agreement and, subject
only to approval of the Arrangement in accordance with the terms of the
Interim Order (the " _ _Company Requisite Vote__ ") and, with respect to the
Company Circular and the matters relating thereto, the approval of the Board
of Directors of the Company _,_ to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Arrangement. This Agreement is a valid and binding agreement of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except
to the extent enforceability may be subject to (A) bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws
affecting or relating to creditors rights generally and (B) general equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (C)
the Currency Act (Canada) which precludes a court in Canada from rendering
judgment in any currency other than Canadian currency.



(ii) The Board of Directors of the Company has: (A) determined unanimously
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement are
advisable and in the best interests of the Company Common Shareholders and
the holders of Company Options and Company RSUs; (B) received an opinion from
its financial advisor, Goldman, Sachs and Co., to the effect that, as of the
date hereof and based upon and subject to the matters set forth therein, the
Exchange Ratio is fair from a financial point of view to the Company Common
Shareholders (other than Parent and its _" _Affiliates_ "_ (as defined in Rule
12b-2 under the Exchange Act)); and (C) determined to recommend that
the Company Common Shareholders and the holders of Company Options and
Company RSUs vote in favor of the Arrangement.



(d) _Governmental Filings; No Violations_. (i) Other than the filings,
notices, approvals and/or exemption orders (A) under the CBCA, (B) under
the HSR Act, (C) under the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, the Ontario
Securities Act and the securities laws of each of the other provinces and
territories of Canada, (D) to comply with state securities or "blue sky" Laws,

") and the Toronto Stock Exchange (" _ _TSX__ "), (F) required to be or
customarily filed pursuant to any state environmental transfer statutes and
(G) under the Investment Canada Act and Competition Act (Canada), and other
than the Interim Order and the Final Order, no notices, reports or other
filings are required to be made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with, and no consents, registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations
are required to be obtained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from,
any governmental or regulatory authority, agency, commission, body or other
governmental entity (" _ _Governmental Entity__ "), in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation
by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Arrangement,



 

9 except where the failure to make any such notice, report or filing or obtain
any such consent, registration, approval, permit or authorization,
individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Arrangement.



(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Arrangement will not, constitute or result in (A) a
breach or violation of, or a default under, the Organizational Documents of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) a breach or violation of, or a
default under, the acceleration of any obligations or the creation of a lien,
pledge, security interest or other encumbrance on the assets of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (with or without notice, lapse of time or both)
pursuant to, any agreement, lease, license, contract, note, mortgage,
indenture, arrangement or other obligation ( _" _Contracts_ "_) binding upon
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Laws or governmental or non-
governmental permit or license to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is subject or (C) any change in the rights or obligations of any party under
any of the Contracts, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C) above, for any
breach, violation, default, acceleration, creation or change that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Arrangement.



(e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements_. The Company has delivered to
Parent each registration statement, report, proxy statement or information
statement that it has filed with or furnished to the SEC since December 31,
2002 (the _" _Company Audit Date_ "_) (collectively, including any
other reports filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date
hereof and as amended, the _" _Company Reports_ "_), including (i) the
Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 and
(ii) the Companys Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March
31, 2003 and June 30, 2003 (including exhibits, annexes and any amendments
thereto). As of their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date
hereof, as of the date of such amendment), the Company Reports did not, and
any Company Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date
hereof will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including the related
notes and schedules) fairly presents, or will fairly present, the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of its date and each
of the consolidated statements of income and of changes in financial
position included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports
(including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents, or will fairly
present, the results of operations, retained earnings and changes in financial
position, as the case may be, of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
periods set forth



 

10 therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to notes and normal
year-end audit adjustments that will not be material in amount or effect), in
each case in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles
( _" _Canadian GAAP_ "_) consistently applied during the periods involved,
except as may be noted therein.

 



(f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as disclosed in the Company Reports
filed with or furnished to the SEC prior to the date hereof, since the Company
Audit Date the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective
businesses only in, and have not engaged in any material transaction other
than according to, the ordinary and usual course of such businesses and there
has not been: (i) any change in the financial condition, business, operations,
results of operations, properties, assets or liabilities of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or any development or combination of developments of which
management of the Company has knowledge that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability
of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Arrangement; (ii) any material damage, destruction or other casualty
loss with respect to any material asset or property owned, leased or
otherwise used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
covered by insurance; (iii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any
dividend or other distribution in cash, stock or property in respect of the
capital stock of the Company; or (iv) any change by the Company in accounting
principles or any material accounting practices or methods. Since the Company
Audit Date, except as provided for herein or as disclosed in the Company
Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC prior to the date hereof, there
has not been any material increase in the compensation payable or that could
become payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any executive
officer or key employee or any material amendment of any of the Company
Compensation and Benefit Plans (as defined in _Section 2.1(h)(i)_ ) other than
increases or amendments in the ordinary course.



(g) _Litigation and Liabilities_. Except as disclosed in the Company Reports
filed with or furnished to the SEC prior to the date hereof, there are no (i)
civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings,
investigations or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any of its Affiliates or (ii) obligations or
liabilities, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether or
not required to be disclosed, including those relating to matters involving
any Environmental Law (as defined in _Section 6.10_ ), or any other facts or
circumstances of which the Company has knowledge that could result in any
claims against, or obligations or liabilities of, the Company or any of its
Affiliates, except, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), for those that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Arrangement.



(h) _Employee Benefits_. (i) A copy of each written, and a description of
each unwritten, bonus, deferred compensation, pension, retirement, profit-
sharing,



 

11 thrift, savings, employee stock ownership, stock bonus, stock purchase,
restricted stock, stock option, stock-based, employment, termination,
severance, compensation, benefit, medical, health or other plan, agreement,
policy or arrangement that covers employees, directors, former employees or
former directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the  _" _Company
Compensation and Benefit Plans_ "_) and any trust or funding agreement or
insurance contract forming a part of such Compensation and Benefit Plan has
been made available to Parent prior to the date hereof. The Compensation and
Benefit Plans are listed in Section 2.1(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter
and any Company Compensation and Benefit Plan that is the subject of a
favorable opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service National
Office, including any master or prototype plan, has been separately
identified in such Section 2.1(h)(i).



(ii) To the knowledge of the Company, all Company Compensation and Benefit
Plans, other than "multiemployer plans" (as within the meaning of Section
3(37) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder ( _" _ERISA_ "_)) (each, a _"
_Multiemployer Plan_ "_) and Company Compensation and Benefit Plans
maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of
employees, directors, former employees or former directors of the Company and
its Subsidiaries working outside of the United States (collectively,  _"
_U.S. Company Compensation and Benefit Plans_ "_) are in material compliance
with all applicable Laws, including the Code and ERISA. Each U.S. Company
Compensation and Benefit Plan which is subject to ERISA (the  _" _Company
ERISA Plan__ _s_ _"_ ) that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a _" _Company Pension Plan_ "_) and that is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is the subject of a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the _" _IRS_
"_) covering all tax Laws changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief
Reconciliation Act of 2001 ( _" _EGTRRA_ "_), is the subject of a request to
the IRS for such favorable determination letter submitted within the
applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code, or is
entitled to rely upon the favorable opinion letters described above, and the
Company is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of
any such favorable opinion or determination letter. There is no pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened material litigation relating to the
Company Compensation and Benefit Plans. To the knowledge of the Company,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction
with respect to any Company ERISA Plan that, assuming the taxable period of
such transaction expired as of the date hereof, would subject the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to a material tax or penalty imposed by either Section
4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA. Since January 1, 2000, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has filed an application under the IRS
Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System or the Department of Labors (the
_" _DOL_ "_) Voluntary Fiduciary Correction program with respect to any
Company ERISA Plan.



(iii) As of the date hereof, no liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV
of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by the Company or any
Subsidiary with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer
plan," within the meaning



 

12 of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of
them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered a single
employer together with the Company pursuant to Section 4001 of ERISA or
Section 414 of the Code (an _" _ERISA Affiliate_ "_). The Company and its
Subsidiaries have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material
withdrawal liability with respect to a Multiemployer Plan (regardless of
whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate of the Company). No
notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA
for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived or extended,
other than pursuant to Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ( _" _PBGC_ "_)
Reg. Section 4043.66, has been required to be filed for any Pension Plan or
by any ERISA Affiliate of the Company within the 12-month period ending on the
date hereof or will be required to be filed in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement.



(iv) All contributions or premiums required to be paid under the terms of
any Company Compensation and Benefit Plan or by any Laws as of the date
hereof have been timely made or have been reflected on the most recent
consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company
Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC prior to the date hereof. Neither
any Company Pension Plan nor any "single-employer plan," as defined above, of
an ERISA Affiliate of the Company has an "accumulated funding deficiency"
(whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or
Section 302 of ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate of the Company has an outstanding
funding waiver. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries has provided, or is
required to provide, security to any Company Pension Plan or to any "single-
employer plan," as defined above, of an ERISA Affiliate of the Company
pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.



(v) Under each Company Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, as of the
last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof,
the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities," within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions contained in the Pension Plans most recent
actuarial valuation), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of
such Company Pension Plan, and there has been no material change in the
financial condition of such Company Pension Plan since the last day of the
most recent plan year. The withdrawal liability of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under each Multiemployer Plan to which the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or an ERISA Affiliate of the Company has contributed during the
preceding 12 months, determined as if a "complete withdrawal" within the
meaning of Section 4203 of ERISA, had occurred as of the date hereof, does not
exceed $5,000,000.



(vi) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries have any obligations for retiree
health and life benefits under any Company ERISA Plan. Each such
plan contains provisions that allow the Company or its Subsidiaries to amend
or terminate such plan at any time without the consent of any other Person and
without incurring liability thereunder other than in respect of claims
incurred prior to such amendment or termination.



 

13 (vii) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Company Compensation and Benefit Plan which would increase
materially the expense of maintaining such Company Compensation and Benefit
Plan above the level of the expense incurred therefore for the most recent
fiscal year. The execution of this Agreement, approval of this Agreement and
the Arrangement by the Company Requisite Vote, or consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement will not
(u) entitle any employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries to severance pay
or any increase in severance pay upon termination of employment, (v)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment of
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any
other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Company Compensation and
Benefit Plans, (w) result in any breach or violation of, or a default under,
any of the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans, (x) limit or restrict the
right of the Company or, after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, Parent to merge, amend or terminate any of the Company
Compensation and Benefit Plans, (y) cause the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, Parent to record additional compensation expense on its income
statement with respect to any outstanding stock option or other equity-based
award or (z) result in payments under any of the Company Compensation and
Benefit Plans that are not deductible pursuant to Section 162(m) or Section
280G of the Code or pursuant to the Income Tax Act (Canada).



(viii) All Company Compensation and Benefit Plans covering current or former
Canadian employees, or their dependents or beneficiaries, of the Company and
its Subsidiaries ( _" _Company Canadian Compensation and Benefit Plans_ "_)
are and have been registered, qualified, invested and administered in all
material respects in accordance with applicable local Laws and the terms of
such Company Canadian Compensation and Benefit Plans. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have complied with all material obligations under such Company
Canadian Compensation and Benefit Plans and there is no proceeding, action,
complaint, investigation or claim in respect of any Company Canadian
Compensation and Benefit Plan initiated by any Governmental Entity or any
other Person (other than routine inquiries and claims for benefits). Each
Company Canadian Compensation and Benefit Plan which is a funded plan was
fully funded as of the last actuarial valuation date on both a going concern
and a solvency basis pursuant to the actuarial assumptions and methodology
utilized in the most recent actuarial valuation therefore as filed with the
applicable regulatory authority. None of the Company Canadian Compensation and
Benefit Plans (other than pension plans) provide benefits to retired employees
or to the beneficiaries or dependents of retired employees. No event has
occurred respecting any registered Company Canadian Compensation and Benefit
Plan which could reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of the
registration of such plan or entitle any Person (without the consent of the
Company or its Subsidiaries) to wind up or terminate any Company Canadian
Compensation and Benefit Plan, in whole or in part, or which could otherwise
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the tax status of any such plan.
None of the Company or its Subsidiaries have taken any



 

14 contribution or premium holiday under any Company Canadian Compensation and
Benefit Plan. None of the Company Canadian Compensation and Benefit Plans, or
any insurance contract relating thereto, require or permit a retroactive
increase in premiums or payments or require additional premiums or payments on
termination of any such plan.



(ix) All Company Compensation and Benefit Plans covering current or
former non-U.S. and non-Canadian employees, or their dependents or
beneficiaries, of the Company and its Subsidiaries ( _" _Company Non-US/Canada
Compensation and Benefit Plans_ "_) are and have been registered, qualified,
invested and administered in all material respects in accordance with
applicable local Law and the terms of such Company Non-US/Canada Compensation
and Benefit Plans. The Company and its Subsidiaries have complied with all
material obligations under such Company Non-US/Canada Compensation and
Benefit Plans and there is no proceeding, action, complaint, investigation or
claim in respect of any Company Non-US/Canada Compensation and Benefit Plan
initiated by any Governmental Entity or any other Person (other than routine
inquiries and claims for benefits). Each Company Non-US/Canada Compensation
and Benefit Plan which is a funded plan is fully funded as of the last
actuarial valuation date on both a going concern and a solvency basis pursuant
to the actuarial assumptions and methodology utilized in the most recent
actuarial valuation therefore as filed with the applicable regulatory
authorities. None of the Company Non-US/Canada Compensation and Benefit Plans
(other than pension plans) provide benefits to retired employees or to the
beneficiaries or dependents of retired employees.



(x) Section 2.1(h)(x) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the amount
of bonuses accrued as of September 30, 2003 with respect to all employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and the amount of bonuses targeted to be
accrued for the remainder of fiscal year 2003.



(xi) The Company RSUs that the Companys Board of Directors granted in October
2003 will not accelerate as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Arrangement.



(i) _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. Except as disclosed in the
Company Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC prior to the date hereof,
the businesses of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries are not being
conducted in violation of any federal, state, local or foreign law, statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, injunction, decree, arbitration
award, agency requirement, license or permit of any Governmental Entity
(collectively, _" _Laws_ "_), except for any violation that, individually or
in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability
of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Arrangement. Except as disclosed in the Company Reports filed with or
furnished to the SEC prior to the date hereof and except for any investigation
or review that, individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay
or materially impair the ability of the Company to



 

15 consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Arrangement, no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity
indicated an intention to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to conduct
the same. To the knowledge of the Company, no material change is required in
the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries processes, properties or procedures
in connection with any Law, and the Company has not received any notice or
communication of any material noncompliance with any Law that has not been

permits, licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and other
governmental authorizations, consents and approvals (the _" _Company Permits_
"_) necessary to conduct its business in all material respects as presently
conducted, except where the failure to have any such Company Permits,
individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Arrangement.



(j) _Takeover Statutes_. No "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (each a _"

the Company, the Company Common Shares, the Arrangement or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement.



(k) _Environmental Matters_. Except as disclosed in the Company Reports filed
with or furnished to the SEC prior to the date hereof and except for matters

impair the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Arrangement: (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries
have complied at all times with all applicable Environmental Laws; (ii) no
property currently owned or operated by the Company or any of

good faith and duly and timely filed (taking into account any extension of
time within which to file) all Tax Returns (as defined in _Section 6.10_ )
required to be filed by any of them, except where failures to so prepare or
file Tax Returns, individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay
or materially impair the ability of the Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement and all such
filed Tax Returns are complete and accurate in all respects, except where
failure to be complete and accurate, individually or in the aggregate, would
not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Arrangement, (ii) have duly and timely paid or remitted all Taxes (as defined
in _Section 6.10_ ) that are required to be paid or remitted or that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries are obligated to withhold from amounts

except with respect to matters contested in good faith in appropriate
proceedings and reserved for in accordance with Canadian GAAP and except where

have not waived any statute of limitations with respect to any United States
or Canadian federal income Taxes or, to the extent related to such Taxes,

and its Subsidiaries for taxable years ended on or after December 31,
2000 and before the date hereof. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
have complied with all United States and Canadian federal information
reporting requirements and has retained all necessary information in its files
to permit continued compliance with informational reporting requirements,
except where failures to



 

17 so comply or retain, individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay
or materially impair the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement. There are no material
liens (including statutory trusts) on any of the assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, except for liens relating to current taxes not yet due
and payable. No closing, settlement or similar agreements have been entered
into by any taxing authority with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except closing, settlement and similar agreements that would
not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Company to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement. None of
Moore Holdings USA, Inc. nor any of its Subsidiaries is or has been a member
of an affiliated group (within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code)
filing consolidated United States federal income Tax Returns (other than such
a group the common parent of which is or was Moore Business Forms, Inc., Moore
U.S.A., Inc., Moore Holdings USA, Inc. or Wallace Computer Services, Inc.)
None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been a party to any
distribution occurring during the last three years in which the parties to

No work stoppage, labor strike or slowdown against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is involved in or threatened
with any labor dispute or grievance which, individually or in the aggregate,
would be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or to
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Arrangement. To the knowledge of the Company, there is no organizing effort or
representation question at issue with respect to any employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. No collective bargaining agreement to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be a party is currently under
negotiation or renegotiation and no existing collective bargaining agreement
is due for expiration, renewal or renegotiation within the one year period
after the date hereof. No trade or labor union, council of trade unions,
employee bargaining agent or affiliated bargaining agent has applied, or to
the knowledge of the Company threatened to apply, to have the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries declared a common employer pursuant to the Labour
Relations Act, 1995 or to be certified as the bargaining agent of any of the
employees.

its Subsidiaries is a party and pursuant to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is authorized to use any third-party patents, trademarks, service
marks, domain names, copyrights, technology, trade secrets, know-how, computer

copyright, patent, trademark, service mark, domain name, trade secret or
other proprietary right of any Person; (II) against the use by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries of any

the Companys capital stock or holders of Company Options and Company RSUs
necessary or required to approve the Arrangement will be that vote determined
by the Court and provided for in the Interim Order.



(q) _Brokers and Finders_. Neither the Company nor any of its officers,

financial advisor, the arrangements with which have been disclosed to Parent
prior to the date hereof.



2.2. _Representations and Warranties of Parent_. Except as set forth in the
corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure letter delivered to
the Company by Parent prior to entering into this Agreement (the _" _Parent
Disclosure Letter_ "_), Parent hereby represents and warrants to the Company
that:



(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has
all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and
is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation
in each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, or to
have such power or authority when taken together with all other such failures,
would not be reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect (as
defined in _Section 6.10_ ) or prevent, materially delay or materially impair
the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Arrangement. Parent has made available to the Company a
complete and correct copy of the Organizational Documents of Parent and its
Significant Subsidiaries, each as amended to the date hereof. Parents and its
Significant Subsidiaries Organizational Documents so made available are in
full force and effect. Section 2.2(a) of the Parent Disclosure
Letter contains a correct and



 

20 complete list of each jurisdiction where Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
(other than any Subsidiaries that have no operations and have no employees)
is organized and qualified to do business.



(b) _Capital Structure_. (i) The authorized capital stock of Parent consists
of (A) 500,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock and (B) 2,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share (the  _" _Parent Preferred Stock_

(B) As of the date hereof, no shares of Parent Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding, but 500,000 shares of Parent Series A Preferred Stock were
reserved for issuance pursuant to the exercise of the rights to acquire shares
of Parent Series A Preferred Stock (the _" _Parent Rights_ "_) issued or to be
issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of April 25, 1996, between
Parent and First Chicago Trust Company of New York, as Rights Agent (the _"
_Parent Rights Agreement_ "_).



(C) Section 2.2(b)(ii) of the Parent Disclosure Letter contains a correct and
complete list as of October 31, 2003 of the aggregate number of outstanding
options to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock (collectively, the " _
_Parent Options__ ") under each of (1) Parents Shares Stock Option Plan, (2)
Parents 1991 Stock Incentive Plan, (3) Parents 1995 Stock Incentive Plan,
(4) Parents 2000 Stock Incentive Plan and (5) Parents 2000 Broad-Based Stock
Incentive Plan (collectively, the _" _Parent Stock Plans_ "_). Between October
31, 2003 and the date hereof, Parent has not granted any additional options
under the Parent Stock Plans or awarded any stock units or restricted stock.



(iii) Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of Parents
Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable

indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, free and clear of any lien,
pledge, security interest, claim or other encumbrance.



(iv) Except for the Parent Rights, except for outstanding rights under
the Parent Stock Plans and except as may be permitted to be issued, delivered
or sold after the date hereof in accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_ , there are
no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion
rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights,
agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that
obligate Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or to sell any shares of
capital stock or other securities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any
securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for,
or giving any



 

21 Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are
authorized, issued or outstanding. There are no outstanding contractual rights
to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, the value of which is
based on the value of Parent Common Stock.

 



(v) Parent does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or
other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or which are
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
the Parent Common Stockholders on any matter ( _" _Parent Voting Debt_ "_). 



(vi) No holders of securities issued by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
have any right to compel Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to register or
otherwise qualify such securities for public sale in the United States.



 

(c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_. (i) Parent has all requisite
corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in
order to execute and deliver this Agreement and, subject only to the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock (provided that at least a majority
of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the
Parent Meeting is present in person or represented by proxy at such meeting)
(the _" _Parent Requisite Vote_ "_) approving each of the Parent Proposals, to
perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement. This
Agreement is a valid and binding agreement of Parent, enforceable against
Parent in accordance with its terms, except to the extent enforceability may
be subject to (A) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting or relating to
creditors rights generally and (B) general equitable principles
(whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).



(ii) The Board of Directors of Parent has: (A) determined unanimously that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement are
advisable and in the best interests of the Parent Common Stockholders; (B)
received an opinion from its financial advisor, Morgan Stanley and Co.
Incorporated, to the effect that, as of the date hereof and based upon and
subject to the matters set forth therein, the Exchange Ratio is fair from a
financial point of view to Parent; and (C) determined to recommend that the
Parent Common Stockholders vote in favor of each of the Parent Proposals.



(iii) Prior to the Effective Time, subject to the Parent Requisite Vote,
Parent will have taken all necessary action to permit it to issue the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock required to be issued pursuant to this
Agreement and the Arrangement. The Parent Common Stock, when issued (A) in
accordance with this Agreement and the Arrangement, (B) upon the exercise of
options issued in exchange for Company Options pursuant to this Agreement and
the Arrangement or (C) upon the vesting of restricted stock units with respect
to Parent Common Stock issued in exchange



 

22 for Company RSUs pursuant to this Agreement and the Arrangement will be
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and no stockholder of Parent
will have any preemptive right of subscription or purchase in respect thereof.
The Parent Common Stock, when so issued as described in clause (A) of the
preceding sentence, will be exempt from registration under the Securities Act
and registered or exempt from registration under any applicable state
securities or "blue sky" Laws.

Exchange Act, (C) to comply with state securities or "blue sky" Laws, (D) as
may be required by the NYSE in respect of the Parent Common Stock to be issued
in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement
and the listing of the Parent Common Stock on the NYSE, (E) required or
advisable to be made or obtained under Canadian securities Laws, the
Investment Canada Act and the Competition Act (Canada) (the " _Competition
Act_ ") and (F) required to be or customarily filed pursuant to any state

required to be made by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with, and no
consents, registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations are required to
be obtained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from, any Governmental
Entity, in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and the consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Arrangement, except where the failure to make any such
notice, report or filing or obtain any such consent, registration, approval,
permit or authorization, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement.



(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent
do not, and the consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Arrangement will not, constitute or result in (A) a
breach or violation of, or a default under, the Organizational Documents of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) a breach or violation of, or a default
under, the acceleration of any obligations or the creation of a lien, pledge,
security interest or other encumbrance on the assets of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) pursuant to, any
Contracts binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any Laws or
governmental or non-governmental permit or license to which Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries is subject or (C) any change in the rights or obligations of
any party under any of the Contracts, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C)
above, for any breach, violation, default, acceleration, creation or change
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement.



(e) _Parent Reports; Financial Statements_. Parent has delivered to
the Company each registration statement, report, proxy statement or
information statement



 

23 that it has filed with or furnished to the SEC since December 31, 2002 (the _"
_Parent Audit Date_ "_) (collectively, including any other reports filed with
or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date hereof and as amended, the _"
_Parent Reports_ "_), including (i) Parents Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2002 and (ii) Parents Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2003 and June 30, 2003 (including
exhibits, annexes and any amendments thereto). As of their respective dates
(or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment),
the Parent Reports did not, and any Parent Reports filed with or furnished to
the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the
Parent Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents,
or will fairly present, the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of income
and of changes in financial position included in or incorporated by reference
into the Parent Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly
presents, or will fairly present, the results of operations, retained earnings
and changes in financial position, as the case may be, of Parent and its
Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end audit adjustments that will
not be material in amount or effect), in each case in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles ( _" _U.S. GAAP_ "_) consistently
applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein.



(f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as disclosed in the Parent Reports
filed with or furnished to the SEC prior to the date hereof, since the Parent
Audit Date Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective
businesses only in, and have not engaged in any material transaction other
than according to, the ordinary and usual course of such businesses and there
has not been: (i) any change in the financial condition, business, operations,
results of operations, properties, assets or liabilities of Parent and its
Subsidiaries or any development or combination of developments of which
management of Parent has knowledge that, individually or in the aggregate,
has had or would reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect
or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Arrangement; (ii) any material damage, destruction or other casualty loss with
respect to any material asset or property owned, leased or otherwise used by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not covered by insurance; (iii)
any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other
distribution in cash, stock or property in respect of the capital stock of
Parent except for dividends or other distributions on its capital
stock publicly announced prior to the date hereof and except as expressly
permitted hereby; or (iv) any change by Parent in accounting principles or any
material accounting practices or methods. Since the Parent Audit Date, except
as provided for herein or as disclosed in the Parent Reports filed with or
furnished to the SEC prior to the date hereof, there has not been any material
increase in the compensation payable or that could become payable by Parent or
any of its



 

24 Subsidiaries to any executive officer or key employee or any material
amendment of any of the Parent Compensation and Benefit Plans (as defined in
_Section 2.2(h)(i)_ ) other than increases or amendments in the ordinary
course.



(g) _Litigation and Liabilities_. Except as disclosed in the Parent Reports
filed with or furnished to the SEC prior to the date hereof, there are no (i)
civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings,
investigations or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened against Parent or any of its Affiliates or (ii) obligations or
liabilities, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether or
not required to be disclosed, including those relating to matters involving
any Environmental Law, or any other facts or circumstances of which Parent has
knowledge that could result in any claims against, or obligations or
liabilities of, Parent or any of its Affiliates, except, in the case of
clauses (i) and (ii), for those that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not be reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement.



(h) _Employee Benefits_. (i) A copy of each written, and a description of each
unwritten, bonus, deferred compensation, pension, retirement, profit-sharing,
thrift, savings, employee stock ownership, stock bonus, stock purchase,
restricted stock, stock option, stock-based, employment, termination,
severance, compensation, benefit, medical, health or other plan, agreement,
policy or arrangement that covers employees, directors, former employees or
former directors of Parent and its Subsidiaries (the _" _Parent Compensation
and Benefit Plans_ "_) and any trust or funding agreement or insurance
contract forming a part of such Parent Compensation and Benefit Plan has been
made available to the Company prior to the date hereof. The Parent
Compensation and Benefit Plans are listed in Section 2.2(h)(i) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter and any Parent Compensation and Benefit Plan that is the
subject of a favorable opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service
National Office, including any master or prototype plan, has been separately
identified in such Section 2.2(h)(i).



(ii) To the knowledge of Parent, all Parent Compensation and Benefit
Plans, other than Multiemployer Plans and Parent Compensation and Benefit
Plans maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of
employees, directors, former employees or former directors of Parent and its
Subsidiaries working outside of the United States (collectively, the _" _U.S.
Parent Compensation and Benefit Plans_ "_) are in material compliance with all
applicable Laws, including the Code and ERISA. Each U.S. Parent Compensation
and Benefit Plan which is subject to ERISA (the _" _Parent ERISA Plans_ "_)
that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2)
of ERISA (a _" _Parent Pension Plan_ "_) and that is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code is the subject of a favorable determination
letter from the IRS covering all tax Laws changes prior to the EGTRRA, is the
subject of a request to the IRS for such favorable determination letter
submitted within the applicable remedial amendment period under Section
401(b) of the Code, or is entitled to rely upon the favorable opinion letters
described above, and Parent is not aware of any circumstances





 

25 likely to result in revocation of any such favorable opinion or determination
letter. There is no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
material litigation relating to the Parent Compensation and Benefit Plans. To
the knowledge of Parent, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in a transaction with respect to any Parent ERISA Plan that, assuming
the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, would
subject Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to a material tax or penalty imposed
by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA. Since January
1, 2000, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has filed an application
under the IRS Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System or the DOLs
Voluntary Fiduciary Correction program with respect to any Parent ERISA Plan.



(iii) As of the date hereof, no liability under Subtitle C or D of Title
IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by Parent or any
Subsidiary with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer
plan," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or
formerly maintained by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity
which is considered an ERISA Affiliate of Parent. Parent and its Subsidiaries
have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material withdrawal liability
with respect to a Multiemployer Plan (regardless of whether based on
contributions of an ERISA Affiliate of Parent). No notice of a "reportable
event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day
reporting requirement has not been waived or extended, other than pursuant to
PBGC Reg. Section 4043.66, has been required to be filed for any Parent
Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate of Parent within the 12-month period
ending on the date hereof or will be required to be filed in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement.



(iv) All contributions or premiums required to be paid under the terms of any
Parent Compensation and Benefit Plan or by any Laws as of the date hereof have
been timely made or have been reflected on the most recent consolidated
balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Parent Reports prior
to the date hereof. Neither any Parent Pension Plan nor any "single-employer
plan," as defined above, of an ERISA Affiliate of Parent has an "accumulated
funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412
of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate of Parent has an
outstanding funding waiver. Neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries has provided,
or is required to provide, security to any Parent Pension Plan or to any
"single-employer plan," as defined above, of an ERISA Affiliate of Parent
pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.



(v) Under each Parent Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, as of the
last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the
actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities," within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions contained in the Parent Pension Plans most recent
actuarial valuation), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of
such Parent Pension Plan, and there has been no material change in the
financial condition of such Parent Pension Plan since the last day of
the most recent plan year. The withdrawal liability of Parent and its
Subsidiaries under



 

26 each Multiemployer Plan to which Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or an ERISA
Affiliate of Parent has contributed during the preceding 12 months,
determined as if a "complete withdrawal" within the meaning of Section 4203 of
ERISA, had occurred as of the date hereof, does not exceed $5,000,000.



(vi) Neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries have any obligations for retiree
health and life benefits under any Parent ERISA Plan. Each such plan contains
provisions that allow Parent or its Subsidiaries to amend or terminate such
plan at any time without the consent of any other Person and without incurring
liability thereunder other than in respect of claims incurred prior to such
amendment or termination.



(vii) There has been no amendment to, announcement by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Parent Compensation and Benefit Plan which would increase
materially the expense of maintaining such Parent Compensation and Benefit
Plan above the level of the expense incurred therefore for the most recent
fiscal year. The execution of this Agreement, approval of each of the Parent
Proposals by the Parent Requisite Vote, or consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement will not (u) entitle any
employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in
severance pay upon termination of employment, (v) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting or trigger any payment of compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant
to, any of the Parent Compensation and Benefit Plans, (w) result in any breach
or violation of, or default under, any of the Parent Compensation and Benefit
Plans, (x) limit or restrict the right of Parent to merge, amend or terminate
any of the Parent Compensation and Benefit Plans, (y) cause Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries to record additional compensation expense on its income
statement with respect to any outstanding stock option or other equity-based
award or (z) result in payments under any of the Parent Compensation and
Benefit Plans that are not deductible pursuant to Section 162(m) or Section
280G of the Code to the extent such payments were so deductible prior to such
events.



(viii) Parent and its Subsidiaries do not have or maintain any Parent
Compensation and Benefit Plans covering current or former Canadian employees,
or their dependents or beneficiaries.



(ix) All Parent Compensation and Benefit Plans covering current or former
non-U.S. and non-Canadian employees, or their dependents or beneficiaries, of
Parent and its Subsidiaries ( _" _Parent Non-US/Canada Compensation and
Benefit Plans_ "_) are and have been registered, qualified, invested and
administered in all material respects in accordance with applicable local Law
and the terms of such Parent Non-US/Canada Compensation and Benefit Plans.
Parent and its Subsidiaries have complied with all material obligations under
such Parent Non-US/Canada Compensation and Benefit Plans and there is no
proceeding, action, complaint, investigation or claim in respect of any Parent
Non-US/Canada Compensation and Benefit Plan initiated by any Governmental
Entity or any other Person (other than routine inquiries and claims for
benefits). Each



 

27 Parent Non-US/Canada Compensation and Benefit Plan which is a funded plan is
fully funded as of the last actuarial valuation date on both a going concern
and a solvency basis pursuant to the actuarial assumptions and methodology
utilized in the most recent actuarial valuation therefore as filed with the
applicable regulatory authorities. None of the Parent Non-US/Canada
Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than pension plans) provide benefits to
retired employees or to the beneficiaries or dependents of retired employees.



(x) Section 2.2(h)(x) of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth the amount of
bonuses accrued as of September 30, 2003 with respect to all employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries and the amount of bonuses targeted to be accrued
for the remainder of fiscal year 2003.



(i) _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. Except as disclosed in the Parent Reports
filed with or furnished to the SEC prior to the date hereof, the businesses
of each of Parent and its Subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of
any Laws, except for any violation that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not be reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Arrangement. Except as disclosed in the Parent Reports filed with or furnished
to the SEC prior to the date hereof and except for any investigation or
review that, individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement, no investigation or review
by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
is pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, nor has any
Governmental Entity indicated an intention to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to conduct the same. To the knowledge of Parent, no material
change is required in Parents or any of its Subsidiaries processes,
properties or procedures in connection with any Law, and Parent has not
received any notice or communication of any material noncompliance with any
Law that has not been cured as of the date hereof. Parent and its Subsidiaries
each has all permits, licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and
other governmental authorizations, consents and approvals (the _" _Parent
Permits_ "_) necessary to conduct its business in all material respects as
presently conducted, except where the failure to have any such Parent
Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement.



(j) _Takeover Statutes_. No Takeover Statute or any anti-takeover provision
in Parents Organizational Documents is, or at the Effective Time will be,
applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Arrangement.



(k) _Environmental Matters_. Except as disclosed in the Parent Reports filed
with or furnished to the SEC prior to the date hereof and except for matters
that,



 

28 individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a

impair the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Arrangement: (i) the Parent and its Subsidiaries have
complied at all times with all applicable Environmental Laws; (ii) no
property currently owned or operated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including soils, groundwater, surface water, buildings or other structures)
is contaminated with any Hazardous Substance which could reasonably be
expected to require remediation pursuant to any Environmental Law; (iii) no
property formerly owned or operated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries was
contaminated with any Hazardous Substance during or prior to such period of

require remediation pursuant to any Environmental Law; (iv) neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries is liable for any Hazardous Substance disposal or
contamination on any third party property; (v) neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any notice, demand, letter, claim or request for

decree, injunction indemnity or other agreement with any Governmental Entity
or third party relating to liability under any Environmental Law or relating
to Hazardous Substances; (vii) there are no other circumstances or conditions
involving Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected
to result in any claim, liability, investigation, cost or restriction on the
ownership, use, or transfer of any property pursuant to any Environmental
Law; and (viii) Parent has made available to the Company copies of all
material environmental reports, studies, assessments, sampling data and other
environmental documents in its possession relating to Parent or its
Subsidiaries or their respective current and former properties or operations.



(l) _Taxes_. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries (i) have prepared in good
faith and duly and timely filed (taking into account any extension of time
within which to file) all Tax Returns required to be filed by any of them,
except where failures to so prepare or file Tax Returns, individually or in
the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability
of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Arrangement and all such filed Tax Returns are complete and accurate in
all respects, except where failure to be complete and accurate, individually
or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability
of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Arrangement; (ii) have duly and timely paid or remitted all Taxes that
are required to be paid or remitted or that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
are obligated to withhold from amounts owing or paid to, or collected from,
any employee, creditor or third party, except with respect to matters
contested in good faith in appropriate proceedings and reserved for in
accordance with U.S. GAAP and except where failures to so pay or remit,
individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Arrangement; and (iii) have not waived any



 

29 statute of limitations with respect to any United States federal income Taxes
or, to the extent related to such Taxes, agreed to any extension of time with
respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, in each case to the extent such

clause (i) of the previous sentence, to the extent related to United States
federal income Taxes, have been examined or reviewed by the relevant taxing
authority or the period for assessment or reassessment of the Taxes in respect
of which such Tax Returns were required to be filed has expired. As of the
date hereof, there are no material audits, examinations, investigations or
other proceedings pending or threatened in writing in respect of Taxes or Tax
matters. Parent has made available to the Company true and correct copies of
all United States federal income Tax Returns filed by Parent and its
Subsidiaries for taxable years ended on or after December 31, 2001 and before
the date hereof. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have complied with all
United States federal information reporting requirements and has retained all
necessary information in its files to permit continued compliance with
informational reporting requirements, except where failures to so comply or
retain, individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement. There are no material
liens (including statutory trusts) on any of the assets of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, except for liens relating to current taxes not yet due and
payable. No closing, settlement or similar agreements have been entered into
by any taxing authority with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except
closing, settlement and similar agreements that would not be reasonably likely
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement. Neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries is or has been a member of an affiliated group (within the
meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code) filing consolidated United States
federal income Tax Returns (other than such a group the common parent of
which is or was Parent). Neither Parent nor any of the Subsidiaries of Parent
has been a party to any distribution during the last three years in which the
parties to such distribution treated the distribution as one to which Section
355 of the Code (or any similar provision of any state, local or foreign Laws)
applied.

or otherwise bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization. No work
stoppage, labor strike or slowdown against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
is pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened. Neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries is involved in or threatened with any labor dispute or
grievance which, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or to prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of the Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement. To the knowledge of the
Parent, there is no organizing effort or representation question at issue with
respect to any employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. No collective
bargaining agreement to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be a
party is currently under negotiation



 

30 or renegotiation and no existing collective bargaining agreement is due for
expiration, renewal or renegotiation within the one year period after the
date hereof.

is licensed or otherwise possesses legally enforceable rights to use all
patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks, domain names, copyrights, and
any applications therefor, technology, trade secrets, know-how, computer
software and tangible or intangible proprietary information or materials that

similar transaction involving any material portion of the consolidated assets
of the Company or Parent or fifteen percent (15%) or more of any equity
securities of the Company or Parent (any such proposal or offer being
hereinafter referred to as an _" _Acquisition Proposal_ "_). Each of the
Company and Parent further agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor any of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and
that it shall direct and cause its and its Subsidiaries employees, agents and
representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or
accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or
indirectly, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential
information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to
an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or
attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or Parent,
or their respective Board of Directors, from (A) complying with Rule 14a-9,
Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal and, in the case of the Company and its Board of
Directors, from complying with Section 99 of the Ontario Securities Act and

territories of Canada or from calling and holding a meeting of the Company
Common Shareholders requisitioned by such shareholders pursuant to Section
143 of the CBCA; (B) at any time before, but not after, the Company Meeting,
in the case of the Company, or the Parent Meeting, in the case of Parent, is
convened, providing information in response to a request therefor by a Person
who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the
Board of Directors of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, receives from
the Person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality
agreement on terms substantially similar to those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in _Section 6.7_ ); (C) engaging in any
negotiations or discussions with any Person who has made an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal; or (D) recommending such an Acquisition
Proposal to the shareholders of the Company or the stockholders of Parent, as

referred to in clause (B), (C) or (D) above, the Board of Directors of the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal



 

36 counsel that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law and (ii) in each case referred to in clause (C) or (D)
above, the Board of Directors of the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor) that
such Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably likely to be
consummated, taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects
of the proposal and the Person making the proposal and could, in the case of
(C), and would, in the case of (D), if consummated, result in a transaction
more favorable to the shareholders of the Company or the stockholders of
Parent, as the case may be, from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement (any such more
favorable Acquisition Proposal being referred to as a _" _Superior Proposal_
"_). Each of the Company and Parent shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Each

Immediately following the Effective Time, the Executive Committee will have
seven members, consisting of the Chairman of each of the Finance, Human
Resources, Audit and Corporate Responsibility and Governance Committees, the

documents as Parent shall reasonably request for purposes of reviewing such
list. There shall be added to such list the names and addresses of any other
Person subsequently identified by either Parent or the Company as a Person who
may be deemed to be such an affiliate of the Company; _provided_ , _however_
, that no such Person identified by Parent shall be added to the list of
affiliates of the Company if Parent shall receive from the Company, on or
before the date of the Company Meeting, an opinion of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Parent to the effect that such Person is not such an

ARRANGEMENT

holders and all beneficial owners of Company Options, (vi) all holders and all

\- 5 - 2.2 Arrangement



At the Effective Time, the following shall occur and shall be deemed to occur
in the following order and without any further act or formality:



     | (a) | Parent shall issue, and be deemed to have issued, to Parent
SubCo that number of duly authorized, fully paid and non-assessable shares of
Parent Common Stock (and associated Parent Rights) that is the product of 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Exchange Ratio, multiplied by 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the number of Company Common Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time after deducting 
---|---|--- 



     | A. | the number of Company Common Shares held by any Dissenting
Shareholder who is ultimately entitled to be paid the fair value of the
Company Common Shares held by such Dissenting Shareholder, and 
---|---|--- 



     | B. | the number of Company Common Shares held by Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent, 
---|---|--- 



     |  | the exact number of which is to be confirmed by way of a
certificate of a director or officer of Parent, and filed with the corporate
records of Parent, at such time that the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock (and associated Parent Rights) issuable under the Arrangement is finally
determinable, and Parent SubCo shall issue, and be deemed to have issued, to
Parent, in exchange therefor, 1,000,000 common shares in the capital of
Parent SubCo. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The outstanding Company Common Shares held by each Company
Common Shareholder other than, 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | Company Common Shares held by a Dissenting Shareholder who
is ultimately entitled to be paid the fair value of the Company Common Shares
held by such Dissenting Shareholder, or  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Company Common Shares held by Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent (which shall not be exchanged under the Arrangement and shall be
cancelled at the Effective Time and cease to exist), 
---|---|--- 



     |  | will be transferred by the holder thereof to, and acquired
by, Parent SubCo without any act or formality on the part of the holders of
such Company Common Shares or Parent SubCo, free and clear of all liens,
claims and 
---|---|--- 



 

\- 6 - authorized, fully-paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock (and
associated Parent Rights) equal to the product of the total number of such
Company Common Shares held by that Company Common Shareholder multiplied by
the Exchange Ratio, and the name of each such holder of Company Common Shares
will be removed from the register of holders of Company Common Shares
and added to the register of holders of Parent Common Stock. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Each Company Option that has not been duly exercised prior
to the Effective Time shall be exchanged for or converted into an option (a
"Replacement Option") to purchase that number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company
Option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. For a Company Option 
---|---|--- 


     | (i) | with an exercise price denominated in Canadian dollars, such
Replacement Option shall provide for an exercise price per share of Parent
Common Stock in United States dollars equal to (x) the exercise price per
Company Common Share of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time divided by the Exchange Ratio, divided by (y) the Currency Exchange Rate
for United States dollars on the Effective Date, or  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | with an exercise price denominated in United States
dollars, such Replacement Option shall provide for an exercise price per share
of Parent Common Stock in United States dollars equal to the exercise price
per Company Common Share of such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio; 
---|---|--- 



      |  | provided that in no circumstance shall the exercise price
per share of Parent Common Stock be less than $.01 and if the calculation
results in an exercise price less than $.01, the exercise price shall be
deemed to be $.01 per share of Parent Common Stock. If the foregoing
calculation results in a Replacement Option (A) being exercisable for a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock, then the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to such Replacement Option shall be rounded down
to the next whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock or (B) having an
exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock that is a fraction of a cent,
then the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock under such
Replacement Option shall be rounded up to the next whole cent; provided,
however, that with respect to any Company Option which is an "incentive stock
option", within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, or which is held by a
person who is a resident of Canada within the 
---|---|--- 



 

\- 7 - paragraph 2(c) shall, if applicable, be modified in a manner so that (i) the
excess of the aggregate fair market value of the shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to the Replacement Option immediately after the issuance of the
Replacement Option over the aggregate option exercise price of such shares
does not exceed the excess of the aggregate fair market value of all Company
Common Shares subject to the Company Option immediately before the issuance of
the Replacement Option over the aggregate option exercise price of such
shares, and, with respect only to a Company Option that is an "incentive
stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, (ii) on a share
by share comparison, the ratio of the option exercise price to the fair market
value of the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Replacement Option
immediately after the issuance of the Replacement Option will not be more
favorable to the option holder than the ratio of the option exercise price to
the fair market value of the Company Common Shares subject to the Company
Option immediately before the issuance of the Replacement Option. The term to
expiry, conditions to and manner of exercising, vesting schedule and all other
terms and conditions of such Replacement Option will be the same as the terms
and conditions of such Company Option. Any document or agreement previously
evidencing such Company Option shall thereafter evidence and be deemed to
evidence such Replacement Options. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Each Company RSU outstanding under the Company Stock Plans
as of the Effective Time, shall be deemed to be exchanged for or converted
into a right (a "Replacement RSU") to acquire or receive (as the case may be)
that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of Company
Common Shares subject to such Company RSU multiplied by the Exchange Ratio;
provided that for the purposes of this paragraph (d) only, in the case of a
holder or participant under the relevant Company Stock Plan who is a resident
of Canada for purposes of the ITA, the Exchange Ratio shall be modified in a
manner such that the aggregate fair market value of the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be acquired or received under the Replacement RSU immediately
after the issuance of the Replacement RSU will not exceed the aggregate fair
market value of the Company Common Shares immediately before the issuance of
the Replacement RSU that would have been acquired or received under the
Company RSU under the relevant Company Stock Plan. If the foregoing
calculation results in a Replacement RSU being exercisable for a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock, then the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to such Replacement RSU shall be rounded down to the next whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock. Such Replacement RSUs shall otherwise
be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the Company RSUs
under the relevant Company Stock Plan. Any document or agreement previously
evidencing such Company RSUs shall thereafter evidence and be deemed to
reference Replacement RSUs. 
---|---|--- 


 

\- 8 - 2.3 Adjustments to Exchange Ratio



Except as set forth in Section 1.6(b) of the Combination Agreement, in the
event that the Company changes the number of Company Common Shares or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Company Common
Shares, or Parent changes the number of shares of Parent Common Stock or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares
of Parent Common Stock, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as
a result of a reclassification, stock split (including reverse split),
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, combination,
issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Exchange
Ratio will be adjusted appropriately to provide the holders of Company Common
Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by the Combination Agreement
and the Plan of Arrangement prior to such reclassification, split, dividend,
distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, combination, tender or
exchange offer or similar transaction.





ARTICLE 3



RIGHTS OF DISSENT



3.1 Rights of Dissent



Holders of Company Common Shares may exercise rights of dissent with respect
to such Company Common Shares pursuant to and in the manner set forth
in section 190 of the CBCA and this Section 3.1 (the "Dissent Rights") in
connection with the Arrangement, provided that notwithstanding subsection
190(5) of the CBCA, the written objection to the Arrangement Resolution
referred to in subsection 190(5) of the CBCA must be received by the Company
not later than 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on the Business Day preceding the
Company Meeting. Holders of Company Common Shares who duly exercise such
rights of dissent and who:

 



     | (a) | are ultimately determined to be entitled to be paid fair
value for their Company Common Shares shall be deemed to have transferred such
Company Common Shares as of the Effective Time, without any further act or
formality and free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances, to the
Company for cancellation in consideration for a payment of cash from the
Company equal to such fair value; or 
---|---|--- 


     | (b) | are ultimately determined not to be entitled, for any
reason, to be paid fair value for their Company Common Shares shall be deemed
to have participated in the Arrangement as of the Effective Time, on the same
basis as a non-dissenting holder of Company Common Shares and shall receive
Parent Common Stock on the same basis as holders of Company Common Shares, 
---|---|--- 


 

\- 9 - but in no case shall Parent, Parent SubCo, the Company or any other Person be
required to recognize any Dissenting Shareholder as a holder of Company
Common Shares after the Effective Time, and the names of each Dissenting
Shareholder shall be deleted from the register of holders of Company Common
Shares at the Effective Time.





ARTICLE 4



CERTIFICATES AND FRACTIONAL SHARES 



4.1 Issuance of Certificates Representing Parent Common Stock



At or as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent SubCo shall
deposit with the Depositary, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common
Shares who will receive Parent Common Stock in connection with the
Arrangement, certificates representing the Parent Common Stock (and
associated Parent Rights) issuable under the Arrangement. Upon surrender to
the Depositary for transfer to Parent SubCo of a certificate which immediately
prior to or upon the Effective Time represented Company Common Shares in
respect of which the holder is entitled to receive Parent Common Stock (and
associated Parent Rights) under the Arrangement, together with a duly
completed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents and instruments as
would have been required to effect the transfer of the Company Common Shares
formerly represented by such certificate under the CBCA and the by-laws of the
Company, and such additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may
reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and after the Effective Time the
Depositary shall deliver to such holder, a certificate representing that
number (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of shares of Parent Common
Stock (and associated Parent Rights) which such holder has the right to
receive (together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto
pursuant to Section 4.2 and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.3) and any certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be transferred to Parent SubCo. No interest shall be paid or
accrued on the cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, payable to holders
of certificates that formerly represented Company Common Shares. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares that was not registered in
the securities register of the Company, a certificate representing the proper
number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to the transferee if
the certificate representing such Company Common Shares is presented to the
Depositary as provided above, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 4.1, each certificate which immediately prior to or upon the
Effective Time represented one or more Company Common Shares, under the
Arrangement, that were exchanged or were deemed to be exchanged for shares of
Parent Common Stock (and associated Parent Rights) pursuant to Section 2.2(b)
shall be deemed at all times at and after the Effective Time, but subject to
Section 4.5, to



 

\- 10 - represent only the right to receive upon such surrender (i) a certificate
representing that number of shares of Parent Common Stock (and associated
Parent Rights) which such holder has the right to receive as contemplated by
this Section 4.1, (ii) a cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 4.3, and (iii) any dividends
or distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofor paid
or payable with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated
by Section 4.2.



4.2 Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates



No dividends or other distributions paid, declared or made with respect
to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time, shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Common Shares that were
exchanged for Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(b) unless and until
the holder of such certificate shall comply with the provisions of Section
4.1. Subject to applicable law, at the time such holder shall have complied
with the provisions of Section 4.1 (or, in the case of clause (iii) below, at
the appropriate payment date), there shall be paid to the holder of the
certificates formerly representing Company Common Shares, without interest,
(i) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 4.3, (ii)
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofor paid with respect to the Parent Common Stock, to
which such holder is entitled pursuant hereto and (iii) on the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to the date of compliance by such
holder with the provisions of Section 4.1 and a payment date subsequent to
the date of such compliance and payable with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock.



4.3 No Fractional Shares



No certificates representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued upon compliance with the provisions of Section 4.1 and no
dividend, stock split or other change in the capital structure of Parent
shall relate to any such fractional security and such fractional interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to exercise any rights as a security
holder of Parent. In lieu of any such fractional securities, each holder
otherwise entitled to a share of Parent Common Stock will be entitled to
receive a cash payment in United States currency from the Depositary equal to
the product of such fractional interest and the Closing Trading Price of
Parent Common Stock, such amount to be provided to the Depositary by Parent
SubCo upon request. Such payment with respect to fractional shares is merely
intended to provide a mechanical rounding off of, and is not separately
bargained for, consideration. If more than one certificate formerly
representing Company Common Shares are surrendered for the account of the same
holder, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock for which such
certificates have been surrendered shall be computed on the basis of the
aggregate number of Company Common Shares represented by the certificates so
surrendered.



 

\- 11 - 4.4 Lost Certificates



In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Company Common Shares that were exchanged
pursuant to Section 2.2(b) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of Company Common Shares
claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, one or
more certificates representing one or more shares of Parent Common Stock (and
associated Parent Rights) pursuant to Section 4.1 and such holders Letter
of Transmittal, in each case deliverable in accordance with Section 2.2, and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 4.3. When
authorizing such payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, the holder to whom certificates representing shares of Parent
Common Stock are to be issued shall, as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, give a bond satisfactory to the Company, Parent and Parent SubCo, and
their respective transfer agents in such sum as the Company, Parent and
Parent SubCo may direct or otherwise indemnify the Company, Parent and Parent
SubCo in a manner satisfactory to the Company, Parent and Parent SubCo against
any claim that may be made against the Company, Parent and Parent SubCo with
respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.



4.5 Extinguishment of Rights



Any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Company Common Shares that are not held by a Dissenting
Shareholder who is ultimately entitled to be paid fair value of the Company
Common Shares held by such Dissenting Shareholder, but was exchanged or was
deemed to have been exchanged pursuant to Section 2.2(b), that has not been
deposited with all other instruments required by Section 4.1, on or prior to
the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date shall cease to represent a claim
or interest of any kind or nature to Parent Common Stock (and associated
Parent Rights). On such date, shares of Parent Common Stock (and associated
Parent Rights) (and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto) to
which the former holder of the certificate referred to in the preceding
sentence was ultimately entitled shall be deemed to have been surrendered for
no consideration to Parent SubCo, together with all entitlements to
dividends, distributions, cash and interest in respect thereof held for such
former holder. None of Parent, Parent SubCo, the Company or the Depositary
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Parent Common Stock (and
associated Parent Rights) (or dividends, distributions and/or cash in lieu of
fractional shares) delivered to a public official pursuant to and in
compliance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.



4.6 Withholding Rights



The Company, Parent, Parent SubCo, and the Depositary shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any dividend or consideration otherwise payable
to any holder of Company Common Shares, or Parent Common Stock, such amounts
as the Company,



 

\- 12 - Parent or Parent SubCo or the Depositary is required or entitled to deduct and
withhold with respect to such payment under the ITA, the Code or any
provision of federal, provincial, territorial, state, local or foreign tax
law, in each case, as amended. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been
paid to the holder of the shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually
remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that the amount so
required or entitled to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder
exceeds the cash portion, if any, of the consideration otherwise payable to
the holder, the Company, Parent, Parent SubCo and the Depositary are hereby
authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of, on behalf of such holder, such
portion of the consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to
the Company, Parent or Parent SubCo or the Depositary, as the case may be, to
enable it to comply with such deduction or withholding requirement and the
Company, Parent, Parent SubCo or the Depositary shall notify the holder
thereof and remit any unapplied balance of the proceeds of such sale less any
costs or expenses incurred by the Company, Parent, Parent SubCo or the
Depositary in connection with such sale.

FORM OF COMPANY AFFILIATE LETTER



_ _, 2004



R.R. Donnelley and Sons Company

77 West Wacker Drive

Chicago, IL 60601-1696



Ladies and Gentlemen:



I have been advised that as of the date hereof, I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of Moore Wallace Incorporated (the "Company"), as such term is
defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and
Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act").



Pursuant to the terms of the Combination Agreement, dated as of November 8,
2003 (as it may be amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the
"Combination Agreement"), among the Company and R.R. Donnelley and Sons Company
("Parent"), the Company and Parent will be combined. Capitalized terms used
herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms
in the Combination Agreement.



I have been advised that the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
the Combination Agreement will be exempt from registration with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act. I have also been
advised, however, that since I may be deemed to be an affiliate of the Company
at the time the Combination Agreement is submitted to a vote of the
stockholders of the Company, my ability to sell, assign or transfer any Parent
Common Stock that I receive in exchange for any shares of common stock of the
Company ("Company Common Stock") pursuant to the Combination Agreement may be
restricted unless such sale, assignment or transfer is registered under the
Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available. I
understand that such exemptions are limited and I have obtained advice of
counsel as to the nature and conditions of such exemptions, including
information with respect to the applicability to the sale of such Securities
of Rules 144 and 145(d) promulgated under the Securities Act.



I hereby represent and warrant to and covenant with Parent that I will
not sell, assign or transfer any shares of Parent Common Stock except (i)
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, (ii)
by a sale made in conformity

 with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 (and otherwise in accordance
with Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if I am an affiliate of Parent and if
so required at the time) or (iii) in a transaction which, in the opinion of
independent counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent or as described in a
"no-action" or interpretive letter from the Staff of the Securities and
Exchange Commission reasonably satisfactory to Parent, is not required to be
registered under the Securities Act. In the event of a sale of shares of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to Rule 145, I will supply Parent with evidence
of compliance with such Rule, in the form of customary sellers and brokers
Rule 145 representation letters or as Parent may otherwise reasonably request.



I understand that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale,
assignment, transfer or other disposition of the shares of Parent Common
Stock by me or on my behalf under the Securities Act or to take any other
action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such
registration available solely as a result of the Combination Agreement. 



I acknowledge and agree that appropriate legends will be placed on
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to me or
held by a transferee thereof, which legends will be removed if (i) one year
shall have elapsed from the date I acquired the Parent Common Stock received
pursuant to the Combination Agreement and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(2)
are then applicable to me, (ii) two years shall have elapsed from the date I
acquired the Parent Common Stock received pursuant to the Combination
Agreement and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are then applicable to me, or
(iii) Parent has received either an opinion of independent counsel, which
opinion and counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a "no
action" letter obtained by me from the staff of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, to the effect that the restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under the
Securities Act no longer apply to me.



I further understand and agree that Parent may instruct the registrar for
Parent Common Stock not to register the transfer of any Parent Common Stock
held by me unless any such transfer is made in accordance with this letter
agreement.



Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on my part that
I am an "affiliate" of the Company as described in the first paragraph of this
letter, or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that I
am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.



This letter agreement constitutes the complete understanding between Parent
and me concerning the subject matter hereof. This letter agreement shall be
governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the
State of New York applicable to contracts to be performed wholly in the State
of New York.



 

\- 2 - If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please so indicate by signing
below and returning a copy of this letter to the undersigned, at which time
this letter shall become a binding agreement between us.





    Very truly yours,
