-iii-    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION   This AGREEMENT AND PLAN
OF REORGANIZATION (this "AGREEMENT") is made and entered into as of June 4,
2007, among Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("PARENT"), Iris Merger Sub, Inc., a California corporation and a wholly
owned first-tier subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER SUB"), and Cholestech
Corporation, a California corporation (the "COMPANY").   RECITALS   A. The
respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have
unanimously approved this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with
and into the Company (the "MERGER") upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the California General
Corporation Law (the "CGCL").   B. For United States federal income tax
purposes, the Merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization described in
section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"CODE").   C. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parent\'s willingness to enter into this
Agreement, certain shareholders of the Company are entering into Voting
Agreements with Parent in the form of Exhibit A (the "VOTING
AGREEMENTS").   In consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties
agree as follows:   ARTICLE 1  THE MERGER   1.1 THE MERGER. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the CGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of
the Merger (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION").   1.2 EFFECTIVE TIME; CLOSING.
Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause
the Merger to be consummated by filing an agreement of merger consistent with
this Agreement, together with an officer\'s certificate of each constituent
corporation, each in a form reasonably satisfactory to the parties, with the
Secretary of State of the State of California in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the CGCL (the "MERGER DOCUMENTS") (the time of such filing (or
such later time as may be agreed in writing by the Company and Parent and
specified in the Merger Documents) being the "EFFECTIVE TIME") as soon as
practicable on or after the Closing Date (as defined below). The closing of
the Merger (the "CLOSING") shall take place at the offices of Foley Hoag LLP,
Seaport World Trade Center West, 155 Seaport Boulevard, Boston,
Massachusetts, at a time and date to be specified by the parties, which shall
be no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article 6 (other than those that by their nature
must be satisfied at the    -1-    Closing), or at such other time,
date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing (the "CLOSING
DATE").   1.3 EFFECT OF THE MERGER. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions
of the CGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   1.4
ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION; BYLAWS.   (a) The Merger Documents shall provide
that, at the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be in the form of the Articles of Incorporation of Merger
Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however,
that as of the Effective Time, Article First of the Articles of Incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation shall read: "The name of the corporation is
Cholestech Corporation."   (b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended.   1.5
DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. The initial directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time,
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be
the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, until
their respective successors are duly appointed.   1.6 EFFECT ON CAPITAL
STOCK. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the
following securities:   (a) Conversion of Company Common Stock.   (i)
Each share of common stock, no par value, of the Company  ("COMPANY COMMON
STOCK") issued and outstanding immediately prior to  the Effective Time,
other than any shares of Company Common Stock to  be canceled pursuant to
Section 1.6(b) and any "Dissenting Shares" (as  defined, and to the extent
provided in Section 1.12(a)), will be  canceled and extinguished and
automatically converted into the right  to receive the number of shares of
common stock, par value $0.001 per  share, of Parent ("PARENT COMMON STOCK")
equal to the "Exchange Ratio"  (as defined in Section 1.6(a)(ii) below) (the
"MERGER CONSIDERATION"),  upon surrender of the certificate representing such
share of Company  Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.7. No
fraction of a  share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the
Merger,  but in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be made pursuant to
Section  1.7(e). Unless otherwise stated or otherwise indicated by the
context,  all references in this Agreement to "COMPANY COMMON STOCK" shall
be  deemed to include the associated preferred share purchase rights 
("RIGHTS") issued    -2-     pursuant to the Amended and Restated
Preferred Share Rights Agreement,  dated January 1, 2005, between the Company
and Computershare Investor  Services, LLC, as Rights Agent, as amended (the
"RIGHTS AGREEMENT").   (ii) For purposes of this Agreement, the "EXCHANGE
RATIO" shall  be equal to 0.43642, subject to adjustment as set forth in
Section  1.6(e).   (b) CANCELLATION OF COMPANY-OWNED AND PARENT-OWNED
STOCK. Each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company or owned by
Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company or of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.   (c) STOCK
OPTIONS; WARRANTS; EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. At the Effective Time, all
options to purchase Company Common Stock then outstanding, whether under the
Company\'s 1997 Stock Incentive Program, 1999 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan
or 2000 Stock Incentive Program (collectively, the "COMPANY OPTION PLANS") or
pursuant to another Company compensatory plan or otherwise (each such option,
whether issued pursuant to the Company Option Plans or otherwise, a "COMPANY
OPTION"), and each warrant then outstanding to acquire Company Common Stock
(the "COMPANY WARRANTS") shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with
Section 5.8. At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume each of the Company
Stock Option Plans, subject to adjustment as provided therein such that
options granted under each such plan after the Effective Time, if any, shall
be exercisable for the purchase of Parent Common Stock. Rights
outstanding under the Company\'s 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
"COMPANY ESPP") shall be treated as set forth in Section 5.8 of this
Agreement.   (d) CAPITAL STOCK OF MERGER SUB. Each share of common stock, no
par value, of Merger Sub ("MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK"), issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no
par value, of the Surviving Corporation. Following the Effective Time, each
certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall
evidence ownership of shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.   (e) ADJUSTMENTS TO EXCHANGE RATIO. The Exchange Ratio shall
be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring on or after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.   1.7 EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES.   (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. Parent shall select an institution
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the exchange agent (the
"EXCHANGE AGENT") in the Merger.   (b) EXCHANGE FUND. Promptly after the
Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for
exchange in accordance with this Article 1, the Merger Consideration issuable
pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company   
-3-    Common Stock and any payment in lieu of fractional shares that such
holders have the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.7(e) (the "EXCHANGE
FUND").   (c) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a certificate or certificates ("CERTIFICATES") that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
which were converted into shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section
1.6 and to each holder of Dissenting Shares, (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (that shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which letter shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Company), (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing
shares of Parent Common Stock, and (iii) such notification as may be required
under the CGCL to be given to the holders of Dissenting Shares. Upon
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor certificates representing
the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which their shares of
Company Common Stock were converted at the Effective Time (and any payment in
lieu of fractional shares that such holders have the right to
receive pursuant to Section 1.7(e) and any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Section 1.7(d)), and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be
deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to
evidence only the ownership of the number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock into which such shares of Company Common Stock shall have been so
converted (and the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance
of any fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.7(e) and any dividends
or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d)). No interest will be
paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock or on any unpaid dividends or distributions payable to holders of
Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a
certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock
may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of
Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.   (d) DISTRIBUTIONS
WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made after the date of this Agreement with respect to Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the
holders of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holders of record of such
Certificates shall surrender such Certificates. Subject to applicable
law, following surrender of any such Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall
deliver to the holders of certificates representing whole shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly, the
amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional share of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(e) and
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after   
-4-    the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock.   (e) FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu
thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating
all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by such holder)
shall receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole
cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the
average closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock for the ten most
recent days that Parent Common Stock has traded ending on the trading day
immediately prior to the Effective Time, as reported on the American Stock
Exchange.   (f) REQUIRED WITHHOLDING. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable
Legal Requirement (as defined in Section 2.2(d)). To the extent such amounts
are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts
would otherwise have been paid.   (g) LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED
CERTIFICATES. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the holder thereof, certificates representing the Merger
Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such Certificates were converted pursuant to Section 1.6, (and cash for
fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.7(e) and
any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d)); provided,
however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the issuance of such Merger Consideration, cash and other distributions,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a
bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.   (h) NO LIABILITY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 1.7, neither the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation nor any party hereto shall be liable to any holder of shares of
Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.   (i) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for 12
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand,
and any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied
with the provisions of this Section 1.7 shall thereafter look only to Parent
for the shares of Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section
1.7(e)    -5-    and any dividends or other distributions with respect
to Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(d),
in each case, without any interest thereon.    -6-     1.8 NO FURTHER
OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY COMMON STOCK. All shares of Parent Common Stock
issued in accordance with the terms hereof (and any payments in respect
thereof pursuant to Sections 1.7(d) and 1.7(e)) shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article 1.   1.9 RESTRICTED STOCK. If any shares of
Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture
or other condition providing that such shares ("COMPANY RESTRICTED STOCK")
may be forfeited or repurchased by the Company upon any termination of the
holder\'s employment, directorship or other relationship with the Company
(and/or any affiliate of the Company) under the terms of any restricted stock
purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company that does not by its
terms provide that such repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
condition fully lapses upon consummation of the Merger, then the shares of
Parent Common Stock issued upon the conversion of such shares of Company
Common Stock in the Merger will, unless otherwise accelerated by their terms
as a result of the Merger, continue to be unvested and subject to the
same repurchase options, risks of forfeiture or other conditions following
the Effective Time, and the certificates representing such shares of Parent
Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends noting such
repurchase options, risks of forfeiture or other conditions. The Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, from and after
the Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option
or other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or
other agreement. A listing of the holders of Company Restricted Stock,
together with the number of shares and the vesting schedule of Company
Restricted Stock held by each, is set forth in Part 1.9 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.   1.10 TAX CONSEQUENCES. It is intended by the parties
hereto that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization described in section
368 of the Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of
the United States Income Tax Regulations (the "TREASURY REGULATIONS").  
1.11 TAKING OF NECESSARY ACTION; FURTHER ACTION. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with
full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to take all such
lawful and necessary action.   1.12 DISSENTERS\' RIGHTS.   (a)
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary other than
Section 1.12(b), any shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who,
subject to and in accordance with Section 1300 et seq. of the CGCL, has duly
demanded the Company to purchase such holder\'s shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the CGCL and has    -7-    complied with all
of the provisions of the CGCL concerning the right of such holder to demand
the Company to purchase such holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock and
who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such
dissenters\' rights ("DISSENTING SHARES"), shall not be converted into
or represent the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
1.6, but instead shall be converted into the right to receive only such
consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting
Shares under the CGCL.   (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
1.6(a), if any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who demands purchase
of such shares under the CGCL shall effectively withdraw or lose (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) such right to demand purchase, then, as of
the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such
holder\'s shares shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and shall automatically
be converted into and represent only the right to receive, upon surrender of
the certificate representing such shares pursuant to Section 1.7, Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 1.6(a) (and any payment in lieu of
fractional shares that such holders have the right to receive pursuant to
Section 1.7(e) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
1.7(d) as though such shares had been so converted as of the Effective Time),
in each case without interest thereon.   (c) The Company shall give Parent
(i) prompt notice of any demands for purchase of any shares of Company Common
Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant
to the CGCL which relate to any such demand for purchase and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings which take
place prior to the Effective Time with respect to demands for purchase under
the CGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for purchase of Company
Common Stock or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate any such
demands.   ARTICLE 2  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   The
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as set forth in this
Article 2, subject to any exceptions stated in the disclosure
schedule delivered by the Company to Parent dated as of the date hereof (the
"COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE"). The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
arranged in sections and paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and
lettered sections and paragraphs contained in this Article 2 and the
disclosure in any section or paragraph shall qualify such sections and
paragraphs, as well as other sections and paragraphs in this Article 2 only
to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of such
disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such other sections and
paragraphs.   2.1 ORGANIZATION; SUBSIDIARIES.   (a) The Company and each
of its subsidiaries (which subsidiaries are identified on Part 2.1 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule) (i) is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it
is organized; (ii) has the corporate or other power and authority to own,
lease and operate its assets and property and to carry on its business as now
being conducted; and (iii) except as would not    -8-    reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 8.3(c)) on
the Company, is duly qualified or licensed to do business in
each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or
licensing necessary.   (b) Neither the Company nor any of the other
corporations identified in Part 2.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule owns
any capital stock of, or any equity interest of any nature in, any
corporation, partnership, joint venture arrangement or other business entity,
other than the entities identified in Part 2.1 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has agreed or is
obligated to make, or is bound by any written or oral agreement, contract,
lease, instrument, note, option, warranty, purchase order, license, insurance
policy, benefit plan or legally binding commitment or undertaking of any
nature, as in effect as of the date hereof or as may hereinafter be in
effect, under which it may become obligated to make any future investment in
or capital contribution to any other entity. Neither the Company, nor any of
its subsidiaries, has, at any time, been a general partner of any general
partnership, limited partnership or other entity. Part 2.1 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule indicates the jurisdiction of organization of each entity
listed therein and the Company\'s direct or indirect equity
interest therein.   (c) The Company has delivered or made available to
Parent a true and correct copy of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of
the Company and similar governing instruments of each of its subsidiaries,
each as amended to date (collectively, the "COMPANY CHARTER DOCUMENTS"), and
each such instrument is in full force and effect. The Company has not taken
any action in violation of any of the provisions of the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company. None of the Company\'s subsidiaries
have taken any action in violation of its respective governing instruments,
except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.   2.2 COMPANY CAPITALIZATION.   (a) The authorized capital
stock of the Company consists solely of 25,000,000 shares of Company Common
Stock, of which there were 15,681,174 shares issued and outstanding as of the
close of business on May 31, 2007, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
no par value, of which no shares are issued or outstanding. All outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and are not subject to preemptive rights created by
statute, the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or any
agreement or document to which the Company is a party or by which it is
bound. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no shares of Company
Common Stock held in treasury by the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for any shares of
Company Restricted Stock will, without any further act of Parent, the Company
or any other person, become subject to the restrictions, conditions and other
provisions of such Company Restricted Stock, and Parent will

form filed with the SEC. All such required forms, reports and documents
(including those that the Company may file subsequent to the date hereof) are
referred to herein as the "COMPANY SEC REPORTS." As of their respective
dates, the Company SEC Reports (i) were prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "SECURITIES
ACT"), or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations
of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Reports and (ii) did not
at the time they were filed (or if subsequently amended or superseded by a
filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such
subsequent filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. None of Company\'s subsidiaries is required
to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC.   (b) Each of
the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any related
notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports (the "COMPANY
FINANCIALS"), including each Company SEC Report filed after the date hereof
until the Closing, (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii)
was prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited
interim financial statements, as may be permitted by the requirements of Form
10-Q or Form 8-K or any successor form under the Exchange Act) and (iii)
fairly presented the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of the Company\'s operations, cash flows and shareholders\' equity for the
periods indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial statements may
not contain all the footnotes required by GAAP for audited statements, and
were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments that the
Company does not expect to be material, individually or in the aggregate. The
balance sheet of the Company contained in the Company SEC Reports as of
December 29, 2006 is hereinafter referred to as the "COMPANY BALANCE SHEET."
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities
(absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) except for (i) liabilities
reflected on the Company Balance Sheet, (ii) liabilities incurred since the
date of the Company Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices, (iii) liabilities incurred in connection with
this Agreement and (iv) liabilities that would not reasonably be expected to

been notified by its independent registered public accounting firm or by the
staff of the SEC that such firm or the staff of the SEC, as the case may be,
is of the view that any financial statement included in any registration
statement filed by the Company under the Securities Act or any periodic or
current report filed by the Company under the Exchange Act should be
restated, or that the Company should modify its accounting in future periods
in a manner that would be materially adverse to the Company.   
-13-     (d) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with
the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "SARBANES-OXLEY ACT")

defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) and internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) are
effective in all material respects. Neither the Company nor, to the
Company\'s knowledge, its independent auditors have identified (i) any
significant deficiency or material weakness in the Company\'s internal
control over financial reporting, (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves the Company\'s management or other employees who have a role in
the preparation of financial statements or the Company\'s internal control
over financial reporting or (iii) any claim or allegation regarding any of
the foregoing. Since December 29, 2006, there has not been any change in the
Company\'s internal control over financial reporting that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\'s
internal control over financial reporting.   2.6 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES

Company\'s capital stock or any other securities of the Company or its

contingent or the terms of which are materially altered upon the occurrence
of a transaction involving the Company of the nature contemplated hereby or
any acceleration or release of any vesting condition to the right to exercise
any option, warrant or other right to purchase or otherwise acquire any
shares of the Company\'s capital stock or any acceleration or release of any

termination of employment or services with the Company, (v) any material
change or alteration in the policy of the Company relating to the granting of
stock options or other equity compensation to its employees and consultants,

with respect to a material Tax Return of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries.   (g) The unpaid Taxes of the Company and its subsidiaries did

by or on behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.   (e) Neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received any notification, written or
oral, that remains unresolved, from FDA or Foreign Authorities indicating
that any product of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is misbranded or
adulterated as defined in the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C.
Section 321, et seq., as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated

subsidiaries, whether in the United States or elsewhere.   (g) To the
Company\'s knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has
committed any act, made any statement or failed to make any statement that

policy with respect to "Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery,
and Illegal Gratuities" set forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (September 10, 1991)
and any amendments thereto. None of the Company, its subsidiaries and, to the
Company\'s knowledge, any manager, officer, employee or agent of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries has been convicted of any crime or engaged
in any conduct that would reasonably be expected to result in (i) debarment
under 21 U.S.C. Section 335a or any similar Legal Requirement or (ii)
exclusion under 42 U.S.C. Section 1320a-7 or any similar Legal
Requirement.   (h) The FDA complaint handling system of the Company and

2.12 WARRANTY MATTERS; PRODUCT LIABILITY. Each product sold, leased, licensed
or delivered by the Company or any of its subsidiaries has been in conformity
in all material respects with all applicable product specifications and
contractual commitments and all express warranties, and neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any liability or obligation of
whatever kind or nature (whether known or unknown, whether asserted or
unasserted, whether absolute or contingent, whether accrued or unaccrued,
whether liquidated or unliquidated, and whether due or to become due) for
replacement or repair thereof or other damages in connection therewith that,
individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company (and, to the Company\'s knowledge,
there is no basis for any present or future action, suit, proceeding,
hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim, or demand giving rise to
any such liability or obligation). There are no existing or, to the
Company\'s knowledge, threatened product liability, warranty, failure to
adequately warn or other similar claims against the Company or any of its
subsidiaries relating to or involving the products of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
material liability to the Company. To the Company\'s knowledge, there are no
written statements, citations, correspondence or decisions by any
Governmental Entity indicating that any marketed product is defective or
unsafe or fails to meet any product warranty or any standards promulgated by
any Governmental Entity. To the Company\'s knowledge, there is no (i) fact
relating to any product of the Company or any of its subsidiaries that would
impose upon the Company or any of its subsidiaries a duty to recall any such
product or a duty to warn customers of a defect in any such product or (ii)
material latent or overt design, manufacturing or other defect in any such
product. No written notice of claim has been served against the Company or
any of its subsidiaries for material renegotiation or price redetermination
of any business transaction that is material to the business of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries, and, to the Company\'s knowledge, there are no
facts upon which any such claim could reasonably be based.   2.13
LITIGATION. There are no claims, suits, actions or proceedings pending or, to
the Company\'s knowledge, threatened against, relating to or affecting
the Company or any of its subsidiaries, before any Governmental Entity or

transactions contemplated by this Agreement or which would reasonably be
expected, either singularly or in the aggregate with all such claims, actions
or proceedings, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or have a
material adverse effect on the ability of the parties hereto to consummate
the Merger. No Governmental Entity has at any time challenged in any
proceeding the legal right of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to
design, offer or sell any of its products or services in the present manner
or style thereof or otherwise to conduct its business as currently

January 1, 2004, Parent has filed all forms, reports and documents required
to be filed by Parent with the SEC and (if and to the extent such forms,
reports and documents are not available on EDGAR) has made available to the
Company such forms, reports and documents in the form filed with the SEC. All
such required forms, reports and documents (including those that Parent
may file subsequent to the date hereof) are referred to herein as the "PARENT
SEC REPORTS." As of their respective dates, the Parent SEC Reports (i) were
prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Reports, and (ii) did not at the
time they were filed (or if subsequently amended or superseded by a filing
prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such subsequent
filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. None of Parent\'s subsidiaries is required to file any
forms, reports or other documents with the SEC.   (b) Each of the
consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any related notes
thereto) contained in the Parent SEC Reports (the "PARENT FINANCIALS"),
including each Parent SEC Report filed after the date hereof until the
Closing, (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) was prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of
unaudited interim financial statements, as may be permitted by
the requirements of Form 10-Q or Form 8-K or any successor form under the
Exchange Act) and (iii) fairly presented the consolidated financial position
of Parent and its subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated results of Parent\'s operations, cash flows and shareholders\'
equity for the periods indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial
statements may not contain all the footnotes required by GAAP for audited
statements and were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end
adjustments that Parent does not expect to be material, individually or in
the aggregate. The balance sheet of Parent contained in Parent SEC Reports as
of March 31, 2007 is hereinafter referred to as the "PARENT BALANCE SHEET."
Neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities (absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise), except for (i) liabilities reflected on
the Parent Balance Sheet, (ii) liabilities incurred since the date of the
Parent Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices, (iii) liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement and
(iv) liabilities that would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.    -34-     (c) Parent has not been notified by its independent
registered public accounting firm or by the staff of the SEC that such firm
or the staff of the SEC, as the case may be, is of the view that any
financial statement included in any registration statement filed by Parent
under the Securities Act or any periodic or current report filed by Parent
under the Exchange Act should be restated, or that Parent should modify its
accounting in future periods in a manner that would be materially adverse to
Parent.   (d) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with
the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that are applicable to Parent, and
any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. Parent\'s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Exchange Act) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) are effective in all material
respects. Neither Parent nor, to Parent\'s knowledge, its independent
auditors have identified (i) any significant deficiency or material weakness
in Parent\'s internal control over financial reporting, (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves Parent\'s management or other
employees who have a role in the preparation of financial statements or
Parent\'s internal control over financial reporting or (iii) any claim or
allegation regarding any of the foregoing. Since March 31, 2007, there has
not been any change in the Company\'s internal control over financial
reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company\'s internal control over financial reporting.   3.5

Sheet, there has not been: (i) any Material Adverse Effect with respect to
Parent, (ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend on,
or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) in respect of, any
of Parent\'s or any of its subsidiaries\' capital stock, or any purchase,
redemption or other acquisition by Parent of any of Parent\'s capital stock
or any other securities of Parent or its subsidiaries or any options,
warrants, calls or rights to acquire any such shares or other securities
except for repurchases from employees or service providers following their
termination of service pursuant to the terms of their pre-existing stock
option or purchase agreements, (iii) any split, combination or
reclassification of any of Parent\'s or any of its subsidiaries\' capital
stock, (iv) any material change by Parent in its accounting methods,
principles or practices, except as required by concurrent changes in GAAP, or
(v) any material revaluation by Parent of any of its material assets,
including writing off notes or accounts receivable other than in the ordinary
course of business.   3.6 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. For purposes of this

Parent.   3.8 LITIGATION. There are no claims, suits, actions or proceedings

after the date hereof, the Company will take all action necessary in
accordance with the CGCL and its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to

that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
is provided to the Company\'s shareholders in advance of a vote on the   
-42-    approval of the principal terms of the Merger or, if as of the
time for which the Company Shareholders\' Meeting is originally scheduled (as
set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient shares of
Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute
a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Shareholders\'
Meeting. The Company shall ensure that the Company Shareholders\' Meeting is
called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited
by the Company in connection with the Company Shareholders\' Meeting are
solicited, in compliance with the CGCL, its Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws, the applicable rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. and all other
applicable Legal Requirements. Subject to Section 7.1(f), the Company\'s
obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Shareholders\' Meeting in accordance with this Section 5.2(a) shall not be
limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement
or submission to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Offer
(each as defined below), or by any withdrawal, amendment or modification of
the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company with respect to
this Agreement or the Merger.   (b) Subject to Section 5.2(c): (i) the Board
of Directors of the Company shall recommend that the Company\'s shareholders
vote in favor of the approval of the principal terms of the Merger at the
Company Shareholders\' Meeting; (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall
include a statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of Company has
recommended that the Company\'s shareholders vote in favor of the approval of
the principal terms of the Merger at the Company Shareholders\' Meeting; and
(iii) neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the Board of
Directors of the Company that the Company\'s shareholders vote in favor of
the approval of the principal terms of the Merger.   (c) Nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from
withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying its recommendation (a "CHANGE
OF RECOMMENDATION") that the Company\'s shareholders vote in favor of the
approval of the principal terms of the Merger if (i) a Superior Offer (as
defined below) is made to the Company and is not withdrawn, (ii) the Company
shall have provided written notice to Parent (a "NOTICE OF SUPERIOR OFFER")
advising Parent that the Company has received a Superior Offer, specifying
all of the terms and conditions of such Superior Offer and identifying the
person or entity making such Superior Offer, (iii) Parent shall not, within
five (5) business days of Parent\'s receipt of the Notice of Superior Offer,
have made an offer that the Company\'s Board of Directors
reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with Savvian
Advisors, LLC or another financial advisor of national standing) to be at
least as favorable to the Company\'s shareholders as such Superior Offer (it
being agreed that the Board of Directors of the Company shall promptly
following the receipt of any such offer convene a meeting at which it will
consider such offer in good faith), (iv) the Board of Directors of the
Company reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer, the withholding,
withdrawal, amendment or modification of such recommendation is required in
order for the Board of Directors of the Company to comply with its fiduciary
obligations to the Company\'s shareholders under applicable law and (v) the
Company shall not have violated any of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 5.2 or Section 5.4. The Company shall provide Parent with at least
three business days prior notice (or such    -43-    lesser prior
notice as is provided to the members of the Company\'s Board of Directors but
in no event less than twenty-four hours) of any meeting of the Company\'s
Board of Directors at which the Company\'s Board of Directors is reasonably
expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 5.4) or
to determine whether such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer. Subject
to Section 7.1(f), nothing contained in this Section 5.2(c) shall limit the
Company\'s obligation to hold and convene the Company Shareholders\'
Meeting (regardless of whether the recommendation of the Board of Directors
of the Company shall have been withheld, withdrawn, amended or modified).  
For purposes of this Agreement, a "SUPERIOR OFFER" shall mean an unsolicited,
bona fide, binding written offer made by a third party to consummate any of
the following transactions: (i) a merger or consolidation involving the
Company pursuant to which the shareholders of the Company immediately
preceding such transaction would hold less than 50% of the equity interest in
the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction or (ii) the acquisition
by any person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder) (including by way of a tender offer
or an exchange offer or a two-step transaction involving a tender offer
followed with reasonable promptness by a cash-out merger involving
the Company), directly or indirectly, of ownership of 50% or more of the
then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, on terms that the
Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good faith (after
consultation with Savvian Advisors, LLC or another financial advisor of
national standing) to be more favorable to the Company shareholders than the
terms of the Merger; provided, however, that any such offer shall not be
deemed to be a "SUPERIOR OFFER" (A) unless any financing required to
consummate the transaction contemplated by such offer is committed, or unless
the Company\'s Board of Directors shall reasonably determine in good faith
(after consultation with Savvian Advisors, LLC or another financial advisor
of national standing) that such financing is likely to be obtained by such
third party on a timely basis or (B) if there is a due diligence condition to
the third party\'s obligation to consummate the transaction that is the
subject of the Superior Offer.   (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from disclosing to its
shareholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act, if, in the good faith judgment of the Company\'s
Board of Directors, after consultation with its outside counsel, such
disclosure is required in order for the Board of Directors to comply with its
fiduciary obligations, or is otherwise required, under applicable law;
provided that the Company shall not disclose a position constituting a Change
of Recommendation unless specifically permitted pursuant to the terms of
Section 5.2(c).   5.3 CONFIDENTIALITY; ACCESS TO INFORMATION.   (a) The
parties acknowledge that the Company and Parent have previously executed that
certain confidentiality agreement dated as of March 30, 2007 between the
Company and Parent, as amended to date (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"),
which Confidentiality Agreement will continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
fourth paragraph of the Confidentiality Agreement, which contains the so-
called "stand-still" provisions, is hereby waived for any action prior to the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.1; provided,    -44-    however, that such fourth
paragraph shall automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect
immediately upon any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(f).   (b) Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other,
will afford the other party and the other party\'s accountants, counsel and
other representatives reasonable access during regular business hours to
its properties, books, records and personnel during the period prior to
the Effective Time to obtain all information concerning the business,
including the status of product development efforts, properties, results of
operations and personnel, as the other party may reasonably request. No
information or knowledge obtained by a party in any investigation pursuant to
this Section 5.3 will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
to consummate the Merger.   5.4 NO SOLICITATION.   (a) From and after the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or termination of this
Agreement pursuant its terms, the Company and its subsidiaries will not, nor
will they authorize or permit any of their respective officers, directors,
affiliates or employees or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor
or representative retained by any of them to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate, encourage or induce the making, submission or announcement
of any Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter defined), (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any nonpublic

except to refer them to the provisions of this Section 5.4(a), (iv) approve,
endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into any letter of
intent or similar document or any contract, agreement or

provided, however, that prior to the approval of the principal terms of the

prohibit the Company from furnishing nonpublic information regarding the
Company and its subsidiaries to, or entering into discussions with, any
person or group who has submitted (and not withdrawn) to the Company an
unsolicited, written, bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Board of
Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good faith (after
consultation with Savvian Advisors, LLC or another financial advisor of
national standing) constitutes, or is likely to lead to, a Superior Offer;
provided that (1) neither the Company nor any representative of the Company
and its subsidiaries shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.4, (2) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that such action is required in order for the Board of Directors of the
Company to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Company\'s
shareholders under applicable law, (3) prior to furnishing any such nonpublic
information to, or entering into any such discussions with, such person or
group, the Company shall have given Parent written notice of the identity of
such person or group and the material terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal and of the Company\'s intention to furnish
nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions with, such person or
group, and the Company shall have received from such person or group an
executed confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive
with regard to the Company\'s confidential information as the Confidentiality
Agreement, (4) the Company shall have given Parent at least three business
days\' advance notice of its intent to    -45-    furnish such
nonpublic information or enter into such discussions, and
(5) contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such
person or group, the Company shall have furnished such nonpublic information
to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information shall not have been
previously furnished by the Company to Parent). The Company and its
subsidiaries shall immediately cease, and cause their respective officers,
directors, affiliates, employees, investment bankers, attorneys and other
advisors and representatives to cease, any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is
understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding
two sentences by any officer, director or employee of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or

subsidiaries; (C) any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar

of its subsidiaries, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or
any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including
matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), to
the same extent such persons are entitled to be indemnified or have the right
to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company or
any of its subsidiaries pursuant to the Company Charter Documents, and
indemnification agreements of the Company and its subsidiaries in existence
on the date hereof with such persons. The articles of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to
exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof, which   
-49-    provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for
a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of Indemnified Parties, unless such
modification is required by law.   (b) INSURANCE. For a period of six years
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain in effect the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
maintained by the Company covering those persons who are covered by the
Company\'s directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy as of the
date hereof (the "DandO; INSURANCE") for events occurring prior to the
Effective Time on terms comparable to those applicable to the current
directors and officers of the Company for a period of six years; provided
that if the existing DandO; Insurance expires, is terminated or is canceled
during such six-year period, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
substitute therefor policies containing terms and conditions which are in all
material respects no less favorable in the aggregate than those applicable to
the current directors and officers of the Company; provided, however, that in
no event will the Surviving Corporation be required in any given year to
expend in excess of 250% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company
for such coverage (and to the extent the annual premium would exceed 250% of
the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the maximum amount
of coverage as is available for such 250% of such annual premium). To the
extent that a six-year "tail" policy to extend the Company\'s existing DandO;
Insurance is available prior to the Closing, the Company may obtain such
"tail" policy and such "tail" policy shall satisfy Parent\'s obligation under
this Section 5.10(b).   (c) THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This Section 5.10 is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the
Indemnified Parties and their heirs and personal representatives and shall be
binding on Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its successors and
assigns.   5.11 STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING. Parent agrees to authorize for
listing on the American Stock Exchange the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable, and those required to be reserved for issuance, in connection with
the Merger, including those shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of
Company Options assumed by Parent, effective upon official notice of
issuance.   5.12 RIGHTS AGREEMENT; TAKEOVER STATUTES. The Board of Directors
of the Company shall take such action as shall be necessary in order to
render the Rights inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any Takeover Statute is or
may become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company and their respective Boards
of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such lawful actions as
are necessary to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act
to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute and any
regulations promulgated thereunder on such transactions.   5.13 CERTAIN
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.   (a) Effective as of the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date, the Company and its Affiliates, as applicable, shall each
terminate any plans intended to include a    -50-    Code Section
401(k) arrangement (unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that
such 401(k) plans shall not be terminated) (the "401(K) PLAN(S)"). Unless
Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no later than
five business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide
Parent with evidence that such 401(k) Plan(s) have been terminated (effective
as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions
of the Company\'s Board of Directors.   (b) As of the Closing Date, Parent
will either (i) permit employees of the Company and each of its subsidiaries
who continue employment with Parent or the Surviving Corporation following
the Closing Date ("CONTINUING EMPLOYEES"), and, as applicable, their eligible
dependents, to participate in the employee benefit plans, programs or
policies (including without limitation any plan intended to qualify within
the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code and any vacation, sick, or personal
time off plans or programs) of Parent on terms no less favorable than those
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent, (ii) continue comparable
Company Employee Plans other than the 401(k) Plans (except as otherwise
provided pursuant to Section 5.13(a)), or (iii) a combination of clauses (i)
and (ii) (it being understood that Parent shall have no obligation to
continue any Company Employee Plan not comparable to plans or programs of
Parent in effect on the Closing Date). To the extent Parent elects to have
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents participate in
its employee benefit plans, program or policies following the Closing Date,
(A) each such Continuing Employee will receive credit for purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit
accrual) under such plan for years of service with the Company (or any of its
subsidiaries), including predecessor employers acquired directly or
indirectly by the Company prior to the Closing Date, and (B) Parent will use
commercially reasonable efforts to (1) cause any and all pre-existing
condition limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of
insurability requirements under any group health plans of Parent in which
such employees and their eligible dependents will participate to be waived
and (2) provide for credit for any co-payments and deductibles prior to the
Closing Date for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-
pocket or similar requirements under any such plans that may apply after the
Closing Date.   (c) Parent agrees that, from and after the Closing Date,
the Continuing Employees may participate in the employee stock purchase
plan sponsored by Parent (the "PARENT ESPP"), subject to the terms and
conditions of the Parent ESPP, and that service with the Company shall be
treated as service with Parent or its subsidiaries for determining
eligibility of the Continuing Employees under the Parent ESPP.   5.14
COMPANY AFFILIATES; RESTRICTIVE LEGEND. Parent will give stop
transfer instructions to its transfer agent with respect to any Parent Common
Stock received pursuant to the Merger by any Company Affiliate, and there
will be placed on the certificates representing such Parent Common Stock, or
any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:   THE SHARES
REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION TO  WHICH RULE
145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED,  APPLIES AND
MAY BE TRANSFERRED ONLY (A) IN CONFORMITY WITH RULE 145(D)  UNDER SUCH ACT,
(B) IN ACCORDANCE WITH A WRITTEN OPINION OF COUNSEL,  REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE

TO THE ISSUER THAT THE TRANSFER IS EXEMPT FROM THE  REGISTRATION AND
PROSPECTUS DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF  1933, AS
AMENDED.   5.15 QUALIFICATION AS A REORGANIZATION. Each of the parties
hereto agrees not to take any action (or fail to take any action), either
prior to or following the Closing, that would reasonably be expected to cause
the Merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
section 368(a) of the Code and the regulations thereunder. None of the
parties hereto shall take any position on any federal, state or local income
or franchise tax return, or take any other tax reporting position, that is
inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, unless otherwise required by
applicable Legal Requirement.   5.16 SECTION 16 MATTERS. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall take all such steps as may be
required (to the extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements) to
cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by Article 1 of this Agreement by each individual
who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act with respect to the Company, and the acquisition of Parent Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock) by each
individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.   5.17 MERGER SUB COMPLIANCE.
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply with all of Merger Sub\'s obligations
under or relating to this Agreement. Merger Sub shall not engage in any
business which is not in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby.   5.18 RESIGNATIONS. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each director and officer of the Company and its
subsidiaries to deliver to Parent, at least five business days before the
Closing, written resignations from each such position as director or officer,
in each case effective at or before the Effective Time.   ARTICLE 6

been true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) shall be true
and correct (without regard to any qualification or exception relating to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect) on and as of the Closing Date with
the same force and effect as if made on the Closing Date except (A) in each
case, or in the aggregate, as does not constitute a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent as of the Closing Date; provided, however, such Material Adverse
Effect qualification shall be inapplicable with respect to the
representations and warranties contained in (1) the first sentence of Section

the Merger will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of section
368(a) of the Code and that each of Parent and the Company will be a party to
the reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code,
provided, however, that if Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, P.C. does not
render such opinion, this condition shall nonetheless be deemed to
be satisfied with respect to the Company if Foley Hoag LLP renders such
opinion to the Company. The parties to this Agreement agree to make such
reasonable representations as requested by such counsel for the purpose of
rendering such opinion.   (f) STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING. The shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger shall have been approved for listing

particular date (which representations shall have been true and correct
(subject to the qualifications set forth in the preceding clause (A)) as of
such particular date) (it being understood that, for purposes of determining
the accuracy of such representations and warranties, any update of or
modification to the Company Disclosure Schedule made or purported to
have been made after the execution of this Agreement shall be

Company:   (a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Boards
of Directors of Parent and the Company;   (b) by either the Company or
Parent if the Merger shall not have been consummated by December 3, 2007 for
any reason; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose action or
failure to act has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of
the Merger to occur on or before such date and such action or failure to act
constitutes a breach of this Agreement;   (c) by either the Company or
Parent if a Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling
or taken any other action, in any case having the effect of permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, which order,
decree, ruling or other action is final and nonappealable;   (d) by either
the Company or Parent, if the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have
been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a
meeting of    -55-    the Company shareholders duly convened therefore
or at any adjournment thereof; provided, however, that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 7.1(d) shall not be available to the
Company where the failure to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval shall

action or failure to act constitutes a material breach by the Company of this
Agreement or (ii) a breach of any of the Voting Agreements by any director or
executive officer party thereto;   (e) by Parent (at any time prior to the

or Section 6.2(b) would not be satisfied, provided that if such inaccuracy in
Parent\'s representations and warranties or breach by Parent is curable by
Parent, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this Section
7.1(g) for 30 days after delivery of written notice from the Company to

such breach by the Company is cured during such 30-day period, or if Parent
shall be in material breach of this Agreement).   For the purposes of this

Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Article 8, each of which shall survive
the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any
party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement. No termination
of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive
termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.   7.3 FEES
AND EXPENSES.   (a) Except as set forth in this Section 7.3, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses
whether or not the Merger is consummated; provided, however, that Parent and

promptly, but in no event later than two days after the date of such
termination, pay Parent a fee equal to $9,000,000 in immediately available
funds (the "TERMINATION FEE"); provided, that in the case of a termination
under Sections 7.1(b) or 7.1(d) prior to which no Triggering Event has
occurred, (i) such payment shall be made only if (A) following the date
of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, a person
has publicly announced an Acquisition Proposal and (B) within 12 months
following the termination of this Agreement a Company Acquisition (as defined
below) is consummated or the Company enters into a binding agreement
providing for a Company Acquisition and (ii) such payment shall be made

Company Acquisition or the entry by the Company into such agreement; and
provided further, that in the case of termination pursuant to Section   
-57-    7.1(f), the Company shall pay the Termination Fee
contemporaneously with the termination of this Agreement.   (c) Each of the
Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, neither the Company nor Parent would
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to pay
in a timely manner amounts due pursuant to Section 7.3(b), and, in order to
obtain such payment, the Company or Parent makes a claim for such amounts
that results in a judgment against the other for the amounts described in
Section 7.3(b), the judgment debtor shall pay to the judgment creditor its
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and
expenses as provided in Section 8.7(b)) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amounts described in Section 7.3(b) (at the
prime rate of Bank of America in effect on the date such payment was required
to be made) from such date until the payment of such amount (together with
such accrued interest). Payment of the fees described in Section 7.3(b) shall
not be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of willful breach of
this Agreement.   For the purposes of this Agreement, "COMPANY ACQUISITION"
shall mean any of the following transactions (other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement); (i) a merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to

hold or, in the case of a subsidiary, the Company holds, less than 50% of the
aggregate equity interests in the surviving, resulting or parent entity of
such transaction, (ii) a sale or other disposition by the Company or any of
its subsidiaries of assets representing in excess of 50% of the aggregate
fair market value of the Company\'s consolidated business immediately prior

way of a tender offer or an exchange offer or issuance by the Company or any
of its subsidiaries), directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a
right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares representing in excess of 50%

Company or any of its subsidiaries.    -58-     7.4 AMENDMENT. Subject

of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party. Delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not
constitute a waiver of such right.   ARTICLE 8  GENERAL PROVISIONS   8.1

results of operations of such party taken as a whole with its subsidiaries,

all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.   8.5 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; THIRD-
PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement, its Exhibits and the documents and
instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by
or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure Schedule and the
Parent Disclosure Schedule constitute the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and    -61-    oral, among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof, it being understood that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the
Closing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this agreement other than (a) as specifically provided in Section
5.10 and (b) after the Effective Time, the rights of holders of shares of the
Company\'s capital stock to receive the merger consideration specified
in Section 1.6.   8.6 SEVERABILITY. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement or the application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.   8.7 OTHER
REMEDIES; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE; FEES.   (a) Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The
parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.   (b) If any action, suit or other proceeding
(whether at law, in equity or otherwise) is instituted concerning or arising
out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereunder, the
prevailing party shall recover, in addition to any other remedy granted to
such party therein, all such party\'s costs and attorneys fees incurred in
connection with the prosecution or defense of such action, suit or other
proceeding.   8.8 GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. The Merger
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State
of California. Other than the Merger, this Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of law thereof. In any action or proceeding between any of the parties
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of the parties hereto: (a) irrevocably
and unconditionally consents and submits, for itself and its property, to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any Delaware State court (or, in the case
of any claim as to which the federal courts have exclusive subject matter
jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America, sitting in
Delaware); (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding
must be commenced, and may be heard and determined, exclusively in   
-62-    such Delaware State court (or, if applicable, such Federal court);
(c) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such action or proceeding in such Delaware State court (and, if applicable,
such Federal court); and (d) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in such Delaware State court (or, if applicable, such Federal
court). Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in Section 8.2. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of any party
to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by
applicable law.   8.9 RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. The parties hereto agree that
they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of
this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.   8.10 ASSIGNMENT. No party may assign (whether by operation of
law or otherwise) either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto provided, however, that the consent of the Company shall not be
required for: (a) an assignment by Parent and/or Merger Sub of any or all of
its or their rights (but not obligations) hereunder to any one or more of its
lenders; (b) an assignment by Parent of this Agreement and its rights and
obligations hereunder to any one or more of its Affiliates, provided that
Parent remains liable and responsible for fulfillment of all of its
obligations hereunder by such Affiliate or Affiliates; and (c) an assignment
by Parent of this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder in
connection with the sale, however effected (whether through a merger, sale of
stock, sale of all or substantially all of the assets, or a similar business
combination) of all or substantially all of the stock or assets of Parent or
one of its Affiliates, provided that the acquirer agrees in writing to assume
and fulfill the obligations of Parent under this Agreement. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Any purported assignment in violation of this Section 8.10
shall be void.   8.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF PARENT, THE COMPANY AND
MERGER SUB HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, SUIT, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF
PARENT, THE COMPANY OR MERGER SUB IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.   *****    -63-     IN WITNESS
WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement and Plan of Reorganization to
