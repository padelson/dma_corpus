pursuant to _Section 4.2(b)_ and (ii) any Appraisal Shares (each share
described in _clauses (i)_ and  _(ii)_ , an " _Excluded Share_ " and
collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall be cancelled and shall be

cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of either a certificate
representing any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_
") or non-certificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive, as the case may be, (i) the Merger
Consideration payable with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock
upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
_Section 4.3_ , without interest or (ii) the payment referred to in _Section
4.9_ , in the case of each Appraisal Share.

  



  

(b)  Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company
and each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any

SECTION 4.3. _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall enter into
an agreement with such bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent
and reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_
") for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, holders of Non-Employee
Company Stock Options and holders of the 2017 Company Warrants who elect to
exercise their respective 2017 Company Warrants (the "
_Electing Warrantholders_ ") to receive the funds to which holders of such
shares of Company Common Stock (other than the Excluded Shares) shall become
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ or _Section 4.2(a)_ , Non-Employee
Company Stock Options shall become entitled to pursuant to _Section 4.4(a)_
or the Electing Warrantholders become entitled to under the applicable 2017
Company Warrant in connection with such exercise, as the case may be. At or
immediately following the Acceptance Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent for the benefit of such
holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares),
holders of Non-Employee Company Stock Options and the Electing
Warrantholders, a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for the
Paying Agent to make payments under _Section 2.1(b)_ , _Section 4.2(a)_ or
_Section 4.4(a)_ and the amounts payable to the Electing Warrantholders under
the applicable 2017 Company Warrant in connection with such exercise, as
applicable (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_
"). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange
Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_
that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall relieve Parent from
making the payments required by _Section 2.1(b)_ , _Section 4.2(a)_ or
_Section 4.4(a)_ or the amounts payable to the Electing Warrantholders under
the applicable 2017 Company Warrant in connection with such exercise or
affect the amount of the Offer Price or Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such shares of Company Common Stock, the Option Payment payable in
respect of the Non-Employee Company Stock Options or the amounts payable to
the Electing Warrantholders under the applicable 2017 Company Warrant in
connection with such exercise and (ii) no such investment shall have
maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement. Any and all interest or other amounts earned with respect to such
funds shall become part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of
the amounts payable under _Section 2.1(b)_ , _Section 4.2_ or _Section
4.4(a)_ or the amounts payable to the Electing Warrantholders under the
applicable 2017 Company Warran _t_ shall be promptly returned to Parent.

  



  

   

18

 



    



  

(b)   _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable (but no later than
five Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
Certificates and to each holder of record of Book-Entry Shares, in each case
whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.2(a)_ , (i) a letter of transmittal,
which shall be in reasonable and customary form, which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent
(or effective affidavits in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 4.3(f)_ )
and which shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration
payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a
Certificate for cancellation (or effective affidavits in lieu thereof in
accordance with _Section 4.3(f)_ ), together with a duly completed and
validly executed letter of transmittal, or receipt of an "agent's message" by
the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall receive in exchange therefor the
amount of cash which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificate or book-entry entitle such holder to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 4_ and the Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares so surrendered shall then be cancelled. No interest shall be
paid or shall accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 4_. If payment is to
be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares so surrendered are registered, such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-
Entry Shares shall be properly transferred and the Person requesting such
issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of
the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such
transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

  



  

(c)   _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender or exchange of Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article 4_ shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares
of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificates or book
entries, and, after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of
Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article 4_
, except as otherwise provided by applicable Law.

  



  

   

19

 



    



   



  

(d)   _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,
Non-Employee Company Stock Options or holders of the 2017 Company Warrants for
six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or one of
its Affiliates, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, Non-Employee Company Stock Options or holders of the 2017 Company
Warrants who have not theretofore complied with this _Article 4_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws, as general creditors thereof) for payment of their claim for
Merger Consideration, Option Payment or amounts payable pursuant to _Section
4.4(c)_ to the holders of the 2017 Company Warrants, as applicable, without
any interest thereon and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law, in respect of such holder's surrender of their Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in _Section 4.3(b)_ , in
respect of their Non-Employee Company Stock Options or in respect of their
2017 Company Warrants, as the case may be.

  



  

(e)   _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective Affiliates shall be liable
to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration or any cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall not have been surrendered prior to the earlier of (i) two years
after the Effective Time and (ii) immediately prior to the date on which the
Merger Consideration payable with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share pursuant to this
_Article 4_ would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, then any such Merger Consideration shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of
a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case
may be, may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall, subject to such
Person's compliance with the exchange procedures set forth in _Section 4.3(b)_
 (other than the surrender of a Certificate), issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable with
respect to the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate
in accordance with this _Article 4_.

SECTION 4.4. _Company Equity Awards and Warrants_.

  



  

(a)   _Treatment of Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
unexpired and unexercised option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
under any Stock Plan (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") shall, to the extent
unvested, become fully vested and exercisable effective immediately prior to
the Effective Time; _provided_ that, any such Company Stock Option that vests
based on the achievement of performance goals shall become fully vested and
exercisable with respect to 100% of the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option: _provided further_ that any
unexpired and unexercised Company Stock Option that is an "incentive stock
option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, shall, to the extent
unvested, become fully vested and exercisable effective no later than five
Business Days prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the holders
thereof or the parties hereto, each Company Stock Option shall be cancelled
and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled
Company Stock Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the
cancellation of such Company Stock Option and in settlement therefor, a
payment in cash (subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes required
by applicable Law) of an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to such cancellation and (ii) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share subject to
such Company Stock Option immediately prior to such cancellation (such
amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the " _Option Payments_ "). No
Company Stock Option that, as of immediately prior to such cancellation, has
an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration shall entitle the holder thereof to any payment with respect to
such cancelled Company Stock Option. The Surviving Corporation shall instruct
its payroll provider to make the Option Payments no later than two Business
Days after the Closing by a payroll payment and subject to withholding, if
any, as described in _Section 4.8_ , to each holder of Employee Company Stock
Options.

  



  

(b) _Termination of Stock Plans_. As of the Effective Time, all Stock Plans
and equity awards shall be terminated, and no further shares of
Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options, restricted stock units, equity
interests or other rights with respect to shares of stock of the Company
shall be granted thereunder.

  



  

(c) _Treatment of Warrants_. All Company Warrants issued to Oxford Finance
LLC on January 6, 2017 or February 16, 2018 that are not exercised in
accordance with their terms as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time
shall terminate in accordance with the terms of such Company Warrants. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause all holders of 2017 Company Warrants to exercise their respective 2017
Company Warrants prior to the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time,
no holder of any Company Warrant shall have any right hereunder or thereunder
to acquire any Company Securities or any securities in the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates. Following the
Effective Time, the Electing Warrantholders shall be entitled to receive with
respect to any exercised 2017 Company Warrant an amount in respect of each
share of Company Common Stock for which such 2017 Company Warrant is
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time equal to (i) the Offer
Price minus (ii) the applicable exercise price per share of such 2017 Company
Warrant; _provided_ that if the exercise price of such 2017 Company Warrant
equals or exceeds the Offer Price, the amount payable in connection with such
election with respect to such 2017 Company Warrant shall be zero

  



  

   

21

 



    



  

(d)   _Board Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or,
if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions
and take all other actions necessary and appropriate (including obtaining any
required consents) to effect the transactions described in this _Section
4.4,_ including delivering written notice (in form reasonably approved by
Parent) to each holder of a Company Stock Option of the treatment of such
award pursuant to this _Section 4.4,_ in accordance with the terms of the
Stock Plans and award agreements issued thereunder, and delivering any notices
required in connection with the Transactions to the holders of the Company
Warrants.

  



  

SECTION 4.5. _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company, the Company Board
and the compensation committee thereof, as applicable, shall take all actions
necessary to terminate the Company's 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "
_ESPP_ ") and all outstanding rights thereunder as of the day immediately
prior to the Acceptance Time, contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing,
and to otherwise effectuate the treatment of the ESPP as contemplated in this
_Section 4.5_. From and after the date hereof, the Company shall (a) take all
actions necessary to ensure that (i) no new participants are permitted to
participate in the ESPP and that participants may not increase their payroll
deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on the date of this
Agreement and (ii) except for the offering or purchase period (if any) under
the ESPP that is in effect on the date hereof (the _" Final
Offering Period_"), no offering or purchase period shall be authorized,
continued or commenced following the date hereof and (b) provide notice to
participants describing the treatment of the ESPP pursuant to this _Section
4.5_. If the Effective Time occurs during the Final Offering Period, the
Final Offering Period shall terminate no later than the day immediately prior
to the Acceptance Time, and the Company shall cause the exercise date
applicable to the Final Offering Period to accelerate and occur on such
termination date with respect to any then-outstanding purchase rights.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (x) all amounts
allocated to each participant's account under the ESPP at the end of the Final
Offering Period shall thereupon be used to purchase whole shares of Company
Common Stock under the terms of the ESPP for such offering period, which
shares of Company Common Stock shall be cancelled at the Effective Time in
exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
_Section 4.2(a)_ following the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock and
(y) the Company shall return to each participant the funds, if any, that
remain in such participant's account after such purchase.

  



  

SECTION 4.6. _Further Action_. The parties agree to take all necessary action
to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable following the
Offer Closing without a meeting of the Stockholders, as provided in Section
251(h) of the DGCL.

  



  

SECTION 4.7. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Without limiting the other
provisions of this Agreement, in the event that, during the period between the
date hereof and the Effective Time, the number of outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock shall be changed into a
different number of shares or securities or a different class, including as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer or other similar transaction, then the Offer Price, the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such change; _provided_
 that, in any case, nothing in this _Section 4.7_ shall be construed to
permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

   

22

 



    



  

SECTION 4.8. _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment to be
made to any Person pursuant to this Agreement any amount that Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable,
reasonably determines to be required to be deducted and withheld under any
applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and properly
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority, any amount so deducted
and withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be, shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such amount
was deducted and withheld.

  



  

SECTION 4.9. _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who
is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares ("
_Appraisal Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL shall not be converted into the right to receive
Merger Consideration and shall entitle the holder only to payment for such
Appraisal Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section
251(h) and Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ that if any such holder shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then such Appraisal Shares shall
automatically be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into,
and become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration
as provided in _Section 4.2(a)_. The Company shall provide prompt notice to
Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares
of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in
and direct ( _provided_ , that such direction may not result in a binding
obligation on the part of the Company that is effective prior to the Effective
Time) all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make
any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands,
or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any cash deposited with the Paying Agent
pursuant to _Section 4.3(a)_ with respect to shares of Company Common Stock
that become Appraisal Shares shall be returned to Parent upon demand
therefor.

to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company has made available to Parent accurate and complete copies of the
Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date hereof.

favorable and up-to-date determination, advisory or opinion letter from the

event has occurred, no condition, facts or circumstances exist that

imposition of material liability, penalty or Tax under ERISA, the Code or
other applicable Law. All assets of the Company Employee Benefit Plans consist

(d)  Each Company Employee Benefit Plan has been operated, established,
maintained and administered in all material respects in accordance with its

with respect to a Company Employee Benefit Plan or otherwise has any
liability in connection with any acts taken (or failed to be taken) with
respect to the administration or investment of the assets of any Company

(g)  The Company does not offer, nor does the Company have any liability or
obligation to provide, life, health or medical benefits or insurance coverage
to any individual, or to the dependent of any individual, for any period
extending beyond the termination of the individual's employment, except to
the extent required by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of

full cost of coverage.

  



  

(h)  Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the

event (such as a termination of employment), will (i) result in any payment
becoming due, or increase the amount of any compensation due, to any current
or former employee or other service provider of the Company, (ii) result in
any payment becoming due under any Company Employee Benefit Plan, (iii)
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company Employee
Benefit Plan, (iv) except as provided in _Section 4.4_ , result in the
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any compensation or

in combination with any other such payment, constitute an "excess parachute
payment," as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code, (vi) result in the
triggering or imposition of any restrictions or limitations on the rights of
the Company to amend or terminate any Company Employee Benefit Plan or
(vii) entitle the recipient of any payment or benefit to receive a "gross up"
payment for any income or other Taxes, including under Section 409A or
Section 4999 of the Code.

  



  

(i)  All Company Stock Options have been granted in accordance with the
terms of the applicable Stock Plan. Each Company Stock Option has an exercise
price that is no less than the fair market value of the underlying Company
Common Stock on the date of grant, as determined in accordance with Section
409A of the Code, and is otherwise exempt from Section 409A of the Code. Each
Company Stock Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under
Section 422 of the Code so qualifies. The Company has made available to
Parent, accurate and complete copies of (i) each Stock Plan, (ii) the forms of
standard award agreement under the Stock Plans, (iii) copies of any award
agreements that materially deviate from such forms and (iv) a list of all
outstanding equity and equity-based awards granted under any Stock Plan,

any Contract governing the terms of such awards and will not cause adverse
tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code.

other independent contractors located outside of the United States, and the
Company does not contribute to or have any obligation to contribute to any

(l) Other than routine claims for benefits, no actions, investigations,
suits, or claims with respect to any Company Employee Benefit Plan are

facts that reasonably would be expected to give rise to any such actions,
suit or claims against any Company Employee Benefit Plan, any fiduciary with
respect to a Company Employee Benefit Plan or the assets of a Company
Employee Benefit Plan.

  



  

(m) There has been no amendment to, or written interpretation of or
announcement by the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to, or change
in employee participation or coverage under, any Company Employee Benefit
Plan that would materially increase the expense of maintaining such Company
Employee Benefit Plan above the level of expense incurred in respect thereof
for the most recent fiscal year ending prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(n)  For each Company Employee Benefit Plan, all contributions, premiums and
payments that have become due through the date hereof have been made within

SECTION 7.2. _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a)  For a period of one year following the Closing Date (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Parent agrees to provide, or to cause one of its
Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) to provide, each individual employed by the Company immediately
prior to the Closing and who continues to be actively employed by Parent
during the Continuation Period (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") with (i)
the base salary or hourly wages that is no less than that provided to the
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) annual cash bonus
opportunities that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the annual
cash bonus opportunities provided to the Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing and (iii) employee benefits (excluding any
equity, equity-based, change in control or severance benefits) that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than either (in the discretion of Parent) (A)
the employee benefits provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Closing or (B) employee benefits provided to similarly-situated new
hire employees of Parent and its Affiliates; _provided_ that in any event,
such employee benefits will be no less favorable than the employee benefits
described in clause _(A)_. Nothing herein shall prevent Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries) from terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee
during the Continuation Period in compliance with applicable Law.

  



  

(b)  During the Continuation Period, Parent shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) to, provide severance pay and benefits eligibility to each
Continuing Employee as set forth on  _Section 7.2_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

  



  

(c)  Following the Effective Time, Parent will, subject to applicable Laws,
give each Continuing Employee full credit for prior service with the Company
for purposes of vesting and eligibility to participate in employee benefit
plans maintained by Parent or its Affiliates for which the Continuing
Employee is otherwise eligible to participate (but such service credit shall
not be provided for benefit of accrual purposes, except for vacation and
severance, as applicable); _provided_ that service of a Continuing Employee
prior to the Effective Time shall not be recognized for the purpose of any
entitlement to participate in, or receive benefits with respect to, any
retiree medical programs or other retiree welfare benefit programs or any
defined benefit plan maintained by Parent or its Affiliates in which any
Continuing Employee participates after the Effective Time. In no event shall
anything contained in this _Section 7.2(c)_ result in any duplication of
benefits for the same period of service. In addition, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (A) waive, or cause to be waived, any
limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions to the same
extent such limitations are waived under any comparable plan of the Company
applicable to such Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time and (B)
recognize, for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under
its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by
Continuing Employees in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.

  



   

56

 



    

  



  

(d)  (i) Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Parent nor any of its
Affiliates to continue to employ any Continuing Employee for any period of
time following the Effective Time, (ii) Parent or its Affiliates may revise,
amend or terminate any Company Employee Benefit Plan or any other employee
benefit plan, program or policy in effect from time to time, subject in each
case to its applicable terms ( _provided_ that this subclause _(ii)_ does not
relieve Parent of its obligations under _Section 7.2(a)_ ) and (iii) nothing
in this Agreement shall be construed as an amendment of any Company Employee
Benefit Plan or any employee benefit plan, program or policy of Parent and
its Affiliates.

  



  

(e)  The parties will cooperate in good faith with regard to any
notification that may be required by the WARN Act or other similar
applicable Law as a result of the Transactions.

  



  

(f)   Except with respect to any obligations of Parent under _Section
7.2(b)_ , the provisions of _Section 7.2_ shall no longer apply to any
employee of the Company whose employment has been terminated and who is later
employed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries.

  



  

(g)  No later than seven days prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall take actions necessary to
terminate the Company 401(k) Plan, such termination to be effective as of the
day prior to the Closing Date and contingent upon the occurrence of the
Effective Time. The Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such plan
has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to
reasonable review and comment by Parent). Parent shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and consistent with Parent's
administrative practices with respect to similarly-situated employees in
similar acquisitions), offer participation in Parent's tax qualified defined
contribution plan (" _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") to each Continuing Employee who
was an active participant in the Company 401(k) Plan as of the date of its
termination and who satisfies the eligibility requirements of the Parent
401(k) Plan. If elected by such Continuing Employee in accordance with
applicable Law, Parent shall cause the Parent 401(k) Plan to, following the
Closing Date, accept a "direct rollover" to such Parent 401(k) Plan of the
account balances (including any participant loans) of such Continuing
Employee.

  



  

   

57

 



    



  

(h)  Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have made all
contributions required to be made to or with respect to each Company
Employee Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date and paid or accrued all
liabilities on account of any Company Employee Benefit Plan in existence on
or before the Closing Date, to the extent such liabilities were required to be
paid or accrued at such times.

  



  

(i)   All formal written communications to the officers or employees of the
Company pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by
this Agreement shall be submitted to Parent in advance, with a reasonable
opportunity for Parent to review and the Company shall consider in good faith
any input from Parent with regards to such written communication.

  



  

(j) From and after the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, assume, honor and perform in accordance with their terms all
employment agreements and offer letters with Continuing Employees that are in
effect immediately prior to the Closing, as set forth on Section 7.2(j) of
the Company Disclosure Letter; _provided_ that nothing in this
_Section 7.2(j)_ or Section 7.2(j) of the Company Disclosure Letter shall, or
shall be construed to, limit, restrict or otherwise affect Parent\'s right
and authority to amend or terminate any such agreement, to the extent
permitted in accordance with the terms of the applicable agreement or letter.

  



  

SECTION 7.3. _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company
or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and
to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any
other actions and things necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm
of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title,
interest and possession in, to and under any of the rights, properties,
assets, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger.

  



  

   

58

 



    



  

SECTION 7.4. _Public Statements_. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
Parent and the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Representatives to, issue any press release or make any
public statement with respect to the Transactions without the prior written
consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) and shall consult with each other prior to issuing
any press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the
Transactions and provide to each other for review an advance copy of any such
press release or statement, except (a) as may be required by applicable
Law, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, (b) with
respect to any press release or other public statement by the Company
expressly permitted by _Section 7.8_ , (c) with respect to any press releases
or other public statements by Parent or Merger Sub in response to any public
announcement permitted by _clause (b)_ hereof, or (d) each party may make any
public statement in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors
or those attending industry conferences, make internal announcements to
employees and make disclosures in Company SEC Documents, to the extent
that such statements are consistent with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by the parties and otherwise in
compliance with this _Section 7.4_. Each of the parties hereto agrees that,
promptly following execution of this Agreement, (i) the Company and Parent
shall issue an initial joint press release with respect to the Transactions,
in a form mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent, (ii) the Company
shall (1) file a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC attaching such
initial press release and copy of this Agreement as exhibits and (2) file a
pre-commencement communication on Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC attaching such
initial press release and (iii) Parent and Merger Sub shall file a pre-
commencement communication on Schedule TO with the SEC attaching such initial
press release.

  



  

  

SECTION 7.5. _Standard of Efforts; Governmental Approvals_.

  



  

(a)  Subject to the terms and conditions provided herein, each party agrees
to use (and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause
to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective,
in the most expeditious manner practicable, and in no case later than the
Outside Date, the Transactions, including (i) preparing and filing as
promptly as practicable with any Governmental Authority all documentation to
effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and (ii) obtaining as

such necessary Authorizations and (1) the Company shall have the right to
review and approve in advance all characterizations of the information
relating to the Company, (2) Parent shall have the right to review and
approve in advance all characterizations of the information relating to Parent
or Merger Sub, and (3) each of the Company and Parent shall have the right to
review and approve in advance all characterizations of the
information relating to the Transactions, in each case, that appear in any
material filing made in connection with the Transactions.

  



  

(b)  In furtherance of, and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the
Company and Parent (and their respective controlled Affiliates, if
applicable) shall: (i) as promptly as practicable, and in any event within ten

Transactions, (ii) as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, make
appropriate filings pursuant to any other applicable Antitrust Law with
respect to the Transactions and (iii) supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested and to
use their reasonable best efforts to take all other actions necessary to cause
the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods or obtain any
required authorizations under such Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable.

  



   

59

 



    

  



  



   



  

(c)  With respect to required Authorizations of Governmental Authorities,
each party will (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection
with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry with respect to the Transactions, (ii) promptly notify the
other party of any communication received from, or given to, any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Transactions and keep the other parties
reasonably informed as to the status of any such request,
inquiry, investigation, or other communication, (iii) subject to applicable
Law, and to the extent practicable, permit the other party to review in
advance any proposed communication by it to any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Transactions, and incorporate the other party's reasonable
comments, (iv) not agree to participate in any substantive meeting or

it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend,
(v) pull and re-file any notice under the HSR Act only if the other party
agrees, and (vi) furnish the other party with non-confidential copies of all
correspondence, filings and written communications between them and their
Affiliates and their respective Representatives on one hand, and any such
Governmental Authority or its staff on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement or the Transactions. At Parent's request, the Company shall give
any notices to Third Parties, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain

any Material Contracts or other Contracts in connection with consummation of

approvals or waivers.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
(i) nothing in this _Section 7.5_ shall limit any applicable rights a party
may have to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_ so long as such
party has up to then complied in all material respects with its obligations
under this _Section 7.5_ and (ii) in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be
required to offer, accept or agree to, and the Company shall not, without
Parent's prior written consent, offer, accept or agree to (1) divest, dispose
of or hold separate any portion of the businesses, operations, assets
or product lines of Parent, the Company or any of their respective

that Parent shall take any such action described in the foregoing sub-clauses
(1) through (3) above with respect to immaterial outlicenses of the Company

agreement with any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
involving a Non-Required Remedy or (y) litigate or participate in the
litigation of any Proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, brought by
any Governmental Authority challenging or seeking to restrain, prohibit or
place conditions on the consummation of the Merger or the Transactions or

SECTION 7.6. _Notification of Certain Matters; Other Actions_.

  



  

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, each of the Company, on the one hand,
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall give prompt notice to the
other of (i) any Proceedings commenced or, to such party's knowledge,
threatened by or against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the
Company or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that (1) if
pending on the date hereof, would have been required to have been disclosed
pursuant to any Section of this Agreement or (2) relate to this Agreement or
the consummation of the Transactions; (ii) any inaccuracy to such
party's knowledge in any material respect of any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement at any time prior to the Closing; _provided_ that
no such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of such party set forth herein; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
unintentional failure to give such notice shall not be treated as a breach of
a covenant but shall be treated as a breach of the underlying representation
or warranty; (iii) any failure of that party to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, undertaking or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it hereunder; (iv) any other event, condition, change, occurrence or
development of a state of facts that would reasonably be expected to cause
the failure of any of the Offer Conditions or any of the conditions set forth
in _Article 8_ ; (v) any notice or other communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with any of the Transactions; and (vi) the occurrence or existence
of any Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as
applicable, or the occurrence or existence of any event, fact, circumstance or
development that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse
Effect, as applicable; _provided_ that the delivery of notice pursuant to this
_Section 7.6_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to any party.

  



  

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, subject to applicable Law and the
provisions of _Section 7.7(b)_ , the Company shall provide Parent with
advance notice of any meetings or scheduled conference calls the Company has
with the FDA or its advisory committees, the EMA or its advisory committees,
or any other similar Governmental Authority. The Company will (i) promptly
notify Parent of any material notice or other communication to the Company
from the FDA or its advisory committees, the EMA or its advisory
committees, or any other similar Governmental Authority and (ii) furnish
Parent with non-confidential copies of all substantive
correspondence, filings and written communications between the Company and

61

 



    



  

SECTION 7.7. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a)  During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall, and shall cause the
Representatives of the Company to, afford to Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Representatives reasonable access to its officers, employees,
agents, properties, facilities, books, records, Contracts and other assets,
and shall promptly furnish to Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives copies of all existing financial, operating and other data
and information as such Persons may from time to time reasonably request;
_provided_  that any such access (including to employees) shall be conducted
at Parent's expense, at a reasonable time and in such a manner as to not to
interfere unreasonably with the normal operation of the business of the
Company. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to, at the request of Parent, facilitate site visits by any of Parent,
Merger Sub or their respective Representatives at any facility of a Third
Party contract manufacturer of the Company. The Company shall instruct its
Representatives to cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub in their investigation
of the Company. No additional investigations or disclosures shall affect the
Company's representations and warranties contained herein, or limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available to Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to
this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Nothing herein shall require the Company to disclose any information to
Parent if such disclosure would, in the Company's reasonable discretion (i)
jeopardize any attorney client or other legal privilege ( _provided_ that
the Company will nonetheless provide Parent and the applicable
Representatives of Parent with appropriate information regarding the factual
basis underlying any circumstances that resulted in the preparation of such
privileged analyses so long as such privilege will not be jeopardized
thereby) or (ii) contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, including any
confidentiality agreement to which the Company is a party ( _provided_ that
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of any such agreement's counterparty to such inspection or
disclosure). The Company and Parent will each use its commercially reasonable
efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

  



  

(c)  The information disclosed pursuant to this _Section 7.7_ shall be
treated in accordance with the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement,
which shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

  



  

   

62

 



    



  

SECTION 7.8. _No Solicitation_.

  



  

(a) At all times during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall not, and
shall not authorize or knowingly permit its Representatives to, directly or
indirectly (other than with respect to Parent or Merger Sub): (i) solicit,
initiate, propose or take any action to knowingly encourage any inquiries or
the submission of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably
be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal or otherwise knowingly
facilitate any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) except
as otherwise expressly permitted by this _Section 7.8(a)_ , enter into,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, furnish to any Third Party any information or data relating to,
afford access to the business, personnel, properties, assets, books or records
of the Company in connection with, or otherwise cooperate with any Person
with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer
that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii)
grant any waiver, amendment or release of or under, or fail to enforce, any
confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement (or any confidentiality,
standstill or similar provision of any other Contract); (iv) enter into any
letter of intent, Contract, commitment or agreement in principle with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any Contract or commitment requiring
the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Transactions or
that would otherwise materially impede the ability of Parent and Merger Sub
to consummate the Offer Closing and the Merger; or (v) resolve, propose or
agree to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if in response to an unsolicited _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal made by a Third Party after the date hereof in
circumstances not involving a breach in any material respect of this
_Section 7.8_ , the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under
applicable Law, then the Company may, at any time prior to the Offer Closing
(but in no event after such time), enter into a customary confidentiality
agreement (x) containing confidentiality and other terms that are no less
favorable to the Company in the aggregate than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement and (y) that does not prevent the Company from
providing any information to Parent in accordance with this Agreement or
otherwise comply with its obligation under this Agreement (an " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ ") with such Third Party making such an Acquisition
Proposal and thereafter (1) furnish information and data with respect to the
Company and afford access to the business, personnel, properties, assets,
books or records of the Company, in each case, pursuant to such Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, and (2) enter into, maintain and participate in
discussions or negotiations with, the Third Party making such
Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives; _provided_ , that the Company
will concurrently provide to Parent any information and data concerning the
Company or access provided to such Third Party that was not previously made
available to Parent. The Company shall ensure that its Representatives are
aware of the provisions of this _Section 7.8(a)_. Without limiting
the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the foregoing restrictions
by any Representative of the Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section 7.8_ by the Company. The Company shall provide Parent with an
accurate and complete copy of any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement as
entered into as contemplated by this _Section 7.8(a)_ promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) of the execution thereof and the Company shall not
terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any material provision of any
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

(b)  The Company shall, as promptly as practicable, and in any event no
later than 24 hours after receipt thereof, notify Parent, orally and in
writing, of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that
expressly contemplates or could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, which notification shall include (i) a copy of the
applicable written Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer (or, if
oral, a summary of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer) and (ii) the identity of the Third
Party making such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall thereafter keep
Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of, or
any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding, any such
Acquisition Proposal, and the material terms and conditions thereof (including
any change in price or form of consideration or other material amendment
thereto), including by providing a copy of material documentation and summary
of communications (which shall include any proposals or offers) relating
thereto that is exchanged between the Third Party (or its Representatives)
making such Acquisition Proposal and the Company (or its Representatives)
within 24 hours after the receipt or delivery thereof.

  



  

   

63

 



    



  

(c) Except as expressly permitted by _Section 7.8(d)_ , neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (1) withhold, fail to include in
(or remove from) the Schedule 14D-9, withdraw, qualify or modify (or
publicly propose or resolve to withhold, fail to include in (or remove from)
the Schedule 14D-9, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Recommendation, (2) adopt, approve, recommend, submit to
the Stockholders or declare advisable or make any recommendation other than a
rejection of (or publicly propose to adopt, approve, recommend, submit to the
Stockholders or declare advisable, or make any recommendation other than a
rejection of), any Acquisition Proposal, (3) fail to (A) reaffirm the Company
Recommendation and (B) recommend against acceptance of a tender or exchange
offer by the Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act for
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, in each case, within eight
Business Days after receipt of a written request of Parent following an
Acquisition Proposal that has been publicly announced (in the case of clause
(A)) or the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer (in the case
of clause (B)); _provided_ that the taking of no position or a neutral
position by the Company Board in respect of the acceptance of any such tender
offer or exchange offer as of the end of such period shall constitute a
failure to recommend against acceptance of any such offer, or (4) take any
action to exempt any Person (other than Parent or its Subsidiaries) or any
action taken by any Person (other than Parent or its Subsidiaries) from any
Takeover Provision (any action described in this _Section 7.8(c)_ being
referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_") or (ii) cause or
allow the Company to enter into a Specified Agreement.

(d)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement to enter into a Specified
Agreement, in each case if, and only if, (i) the Company is not in breach in
any material respect of this _Section 7.8_ in connection with the
Superior Proposal or Acquisition Proposal that was a precursor to the
Specified Agreement, (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel, that the failure to
make the Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement to
enter into a Specified Agreement would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board under applicable Law, (iii) the Company has given
Parent written notice of the Company Board's intention to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement to enter into a
Specified Agreement not earlier than 11:59 p.m. New York time on the fifth
Business Day after Parent receives such written notice, (iv) if not in
connection with an Intervening Event pursuant to _Section 7.8(e)_ , the
decision to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change is in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal or with the Company's intent to
terminate this Agreement to enter into a Specified Agreement, and the Company
shall have complied with _clauses (1)_ through _(5)_ , as follows: (1) prior
to giving effect to _clauses (2)_ through _(5)_ , the Company Board shall
have determined that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal,
(2) the Company shall have made available to Parent orally and in writing the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and copies of all
written communications (and, if oral, a summary of the material terms of such
communications) relating to such Acquisition Proposal in accordance with
_Section 7.8(b)_ , (3) the Company shall have negotiated in good faith with
Parent (and caused its Representatives to negotiate with Parent), to the
extent that Parent desires to negotiate, during the five Business Day period
provided in the foregoing _clause (iii)_ of this _Section 7.8(d)_ with respect
to such proposed revisions to this Agreement or other proposals made by
Parent, if any, so that the Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal, (4) after considering the results of negotiations with
Parent and taking into account the proposals made by Parent, if any, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, the Company Board shall have determined in
good faith that such Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Proposal, and,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make
the Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement to
enter into a Specified Agreement would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board under applicable Law and (5) if the Company
intends to terminate this Agreement to enter into a Specified Agreement, the
Company shall have complied with _Section 9.1(d)(i)_. For clarity, the
provisions of this _Section 7.8(d)_ shall also apply to any amendment to the
financial terms or any other material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal
(except that any reference to five Business Days shall instead be three
Business Days) or any successive Acquisition Proposals.

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect to an Intervening Event, if and only if:
(i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Company's outside legal counsel, that the failure to make the Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board under applicable Law; (ii) Parent shall have received from the
Company written notice not later than 11:59 p.m. New York time on the fifth
Business Day prior to the making of any Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, describing the Intervening Event in reasonable detail; (iii) during
the five Business Day period provided in the foregoing _clause (ii)_ , the
Company shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent (and caused its
Representatives to negotiate with Parent), to the extent that Parent desires
to negotiate, with respect to any proposed revisions to this Agreement or
other proposals made by Parent, if any, that would obviate the requirement to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; and (iv) after considering the
results of negotiations with Parent and taking into account the proposals
made by Parent, if any, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith that the failure to make
the Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable Law. For the avoidance
of doubt, the provisions of this _Section 7.8(e)_ shall also apply to any
material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such Intervening
Event (except that any reference to five Business Days shall instead be three
Business Days).

  



  

   

65

 



    



  

(f)  Nothing in this _Section 7.8_ shall prohibit the Company from (i)
taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
under the Exchange Act or complying with Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under
the Exchange Act, (ii) making any required disclosure to the Stockholders, if
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such position or make such disclosure
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or any
disclosure requirement under applicable Law or (iii) making any disclosure
that constitutes a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_  that this _Section
7.8(f)_ shall not permit the Company Board to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, except to the extent permitted by _Section 7.8(d)_ or
_Section 7.8(e)_.

possible Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) promptly (but in no event later than
two Business Days following the execution of this Agreement) request and use
reasonable best efforts to obtain the return from all such Persons, or cause
the destruction, of all copies of confidential information previously
provided to such Persons by or on behalf of the Company or its
Representatives (and all analyses and other materials prepared by or on
behalf of such Persons that contain, reflect or analyze such confidential
information).

  



  

SECTION 7.9. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a)  After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor all rights and
obligations to indemnification by the Company (including advancement of
expenses subject to and in accordance with _Section 7.9(d_ )) now existing in
favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of
the Company (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the Company
Charter Documents, in each case as in effect on the date hereof.

  



  

(b)  After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified
Party against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, fees,
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel, which shall be
advanced as they are incurred), Judgments, fines, penalties or liabilities
(including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) in connection with
or arising in whole or in part out of actions, omissions, suits or other
proceedings (whether civil or criminal, and including any proceeding before
any administrative or legislative body) in which such Indemnified Party may be
involved or with which he or she may be threatened (regardless of whether as
a named party or as a participant other than as a named party, including as a
witness) (an " _Indemnified Proceeding_ ") by reason of such Indemnified
Party's being or having been a director or officer the Company at, or at any
time prior to, the Effective Time or in connection with any action taken or
not taken by such Indemnified Party at the request of the Company at, or at
any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any Indemnified
Proceeding relating in whole or in part to the Transactions or relating to
the enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification or advancement
right of any Indemnified Party), subject to and in accordance with _Section
7.9(e)_.

  



  

   

66

 



    



  

(c)  Parent's and the Surviving Corporation's obligations under _Section
7.9(a)_ and _Section 7.9(b)_ shall continue in full force and effect for a
period of six years from the Effective Time; _provided_ , however, that all
rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses in respect
of any claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the
final disposition of such claim.

  



  

(d)  From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Closing
Date, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain the officers' and directors' liability insurance in
respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time
covering each such Person currently covered by the Company's officers' and
directors' liability insurance policies on terms with respect to coverage
and amount no less favorable than those of such policies in effect on the
date hereof; _provided_ that in satisfying its obligation under this _Section
7.9(d)_ , the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay an amount
per year in excess of 300% of the annual premium payable by the Company for
the coverage year in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum
Amount_ ") and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed
the Maximum Amount, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving Corporation's good
faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to the Maximum Amount. The provisions of the immediately preceding
sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail" or "runoff"
policies have been obtained by the Company (at its election) prior to
the Effective Time, which policies provide such directors and officers with
coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to claims arising
from acts or omissions that occurred on or before the Effective Time,
including, in respect of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
amount paid for such prepaid policies does not exceed the Maximum Amount. If
such prepaid policies have been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect for their
full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

  



  

   

67

 



    



  

(e) Upon learning of any Proceeding in which any claims are made in respect
of which such Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this _Section 7.9_ , any Indemnified Party wishing to claim such
indemnification shall promptly notify Parent thereof in writing, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of
any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such
failure materially prejudices Parent or the Surviving Corporation. In the
event of any such Proceeding: (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof (it being understood that by
electing to assume the defense thereof, neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the
Indemnified Party's entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect
thereto or assumed any liability with respect thereto), except that if Parent
or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or legal
counsel for the Indemnified Party advises that there are issues which raise
conflicts of interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may retain legal counsel
satisfactory to Parent and to the provider of any insurance obtained in
accordance with _Section 7.9(d)_ , and Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall pay all reasonable and documented fees, costs and expenses of such
legal counsel for the Indemnified Party as statements therefor are received;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (1) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be obligated pursuant to this _Section 7.9(e)_ to pay for only one firm of
legal counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use
of one legal counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such legal
counsel with a conflict of interest (in which case the fewest number of
legal counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used) and
(2) the Indemnified Party shall have made an undertaking to repay all such
fees, costs or expenses paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation if and to
the extent that it is ultimately determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final judgment that the Indemnified Party is not entitled
to be indemnified by Parent or the Surviving Corporation; (ii) the
Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter if
Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects to assume such defense; (iii)
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without their prior written consent and the prior written consent of
the provider of any insurance obtained in accordance with _Section 7.9(d)_ ,
in each case if Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such
defense; and (iv) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have
any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final, that the indemnified action of such Indemnified Party
in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

  



  

(f)  The provisions of this _Section 7.9_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such individual may have under any certificate of incorporation or bylaws,
by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this _Section 7.9_ shall survive the Offer Closing and the
consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such a
manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this _Section
7.9_ applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it
being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section
7.9_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.9_, each
of whom may enforce the provisions of this _Section 7.9_).

  



  

(g)  In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and
assets to any Person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation,
then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 7.9_.

  



  

   

68

 



    



  

SECTION 7.10. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
and the Company Board shall take all such steps as may be required to cause

securities) in connection with this Agreement by each Company director or
officer who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company's equity securities to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  



  

SECTION 7.11. _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise
Parent in writing of any Transaction Litigation and shall keep
Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis regarding any such Transaction
Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to (a) participate
in the defense, prosecution, settlement or compromise of any Transaction
Litigation, and (b) consult with counsel to the Company regarding the
defense, prosecution, settlement or compromise with respect to any
such Transaction Litigation. For purposes of this _Section 7.11_ ,
"participate" means that Parent will be kept reasonably apprised of proposed
strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the Transaction
Litigation (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege between the
Company and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise adversely affected),
and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such Transaction
Litigation which the Company shall consider in good faith; _provided_ that
the Company shall not settle or compromise or agree to settle or compromise
any Transaction Litigation without Parent's prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

SECTION 7.12. _Deregistration; Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the

best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to
be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Law and rules and policies of NASDAQ to cause the delisting of the
Company and of the Company Common Stock from NASDAQ as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time and deregistration of the Company Common
Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting,
and in any event no more than 10 days after the Closing Date. The Company
shall not cause the Company Common Stock to be delisted from NASDAQ prior to
the Effective Time.

  



  

SECTION 7.13. _Takeover Provisions_. If any Takeover Provision becomes or is
deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Offer, the
Merger or any other Transaction, then each of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub, and their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act
to render such Takeover Provision inapplicable to the foregoing.

  



  

SECTION 7.14. _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
comply in all respects with each of the representations, warranties,
covenants, obligations, agreements and undertakings made or required to be
performed by Merger Sub in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger, and the other Transactions.

case, for purposes of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act and to satisfy
the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)
under the Exchange Act.

with Section 228 of the DGCL and in its capacity as the sole stockholder of

SECTION 7.18. _Loan and Security Agreement_. The Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to deliver all notices and take all other actions reasonably

in full of all obligations outstanding thereunder, the release of all Liens

reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent and Merger Sub no later than

with respect to the Loan and Security Agreement in form and substance
customary for transactions of this type, from the lenders (or their
representative(s)) under the Loan and Security Agreement (the " _Payoff

documentation shall, among other things, include the payoff amount and provide
that Liens (and any guarantees) granted in connection therewith relating to
the assets, rights and properties of the Company securing such indebtedness

Time be released and terminated. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, in no event shall this _Section 7.18_ require the Company to cause
the LSA Terminations to be effective unless and until the Effective Time has
occurred and Parent or Merger Sub has provided or caused to be provided to
the Company by wire transfer immediately available funds (or Parent or Merger
Sub has directed the Company to use funds on its balance sheet, to the extent
such funds are available as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) to
pay in full the then-outstanding principal amount of and accrued and unpaid

forth in this Agreement shall have occurred, which breach or failure to
perform has a Parent Material Adverse Effect; _provided_  that, for purposes
of this _Section 9.1(d)(ii)_ , if such a breach is curable by Parent within

termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

SECTION 9.3. _Termination Fee and Expenses_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in this _Section 9.3_ , all costs and
Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
shall be paid by the party incurring such costs or Expenses, whether or not
the Transactions are consummated; _provided_ that Parent shall pay (i) all
filing fees payable pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws, and
(ii) except as provided in _Section 4.3(b)_ , all transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees imposed with
respect to the transfer of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or
the Merger.

  



  

(b)  In the event that:

  



  

(i)  this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
9.1(c)(i)_ or _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ ;

  



  

(ii)  this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 9.1(d)(i)_ ; or

  



  

(iii)  (1) this Agreement is terminated by Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ , _Section 9.1(b)(iii)_  or
_Section 9.1(c)(iii)_ , (2) after the date of this Agreement an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been made to the Company or shall have been publicly made
directly to the Stockholders, in each case, not withdrawn prior to the date of
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_ , and (3) the Company
consummates an Acquisition Proposal within 12 months after such termination
or the Company enters into a definitive agreement within 12 months after such
termination in either case to effect an Acquisition Proposal which is
subsequently consummated (replacing "15%" in the definition thereof with
"50%");

  



  

then, in any such event under _clause (i)_ ,  _(ii)_ , or _(iii)_ of this
_Section 9.3(b)_ , the Company shall pay to Parent, in cash at the time
specified in the next sentence, a nonrefundable termination fee of
$95,300,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "). Any payment of the Termination Fee
required to be made pursuant to: (1) _Section 9.3(b)(i)_ shall be made to
Parent within one Business Day after termination of this Agreement by Parent
as set forth in _Section 9.3(b)(i)_ ; (2) _Section 9.3(b)(ii)_ shall be made
to Parent concurrently with and as a condition to such termination of this
Agreement by the Company as set forth in _Section 9.3(b)(ii)_ ; and (3)
_Section 9.3(b)(iii)_ shall be made to Parent concurrently with the occurrence
of the applicable event described in _clause (3)_ of _Section 9.3(b)(iii)_.
All payments under this _Section 9.3(b)_ shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account to be designated by Parent. Except
in the case of common law fraud or a Willful Breach, in the event that Parent
receives full payment pursuant to this _Section 9.3(b)_ , then, receipt of
the Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement
(and the termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof)
or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent,
Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be
entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the
Company or any of its Affiliates for damages or any equitable relief arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any
matters forming the basis for such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this  _Section 9.3(b)_ shall prevent, limit or otherwise restrict
the right of Parent and Merger Sub to bring or maintain any claims arising
out of the Company's common law fraud or Willful Breach of any provision of
this Agreement or any other agreement delivered in connection herewith and
any Termination Fee paid to Parent hereunder will be offset against any award
for damages given to Parent pursuant to any claim for fraud or Willful
Breach. For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by the Company under
this _Section 9.3(b)_ shall be payable only once with respect to this _Section
9.3(b)_ and not in duplication even though such payment may be payable under
one or more provisions hereof.

  



  

   

74

 



    



  

(c)  The Company and Parent acknowledge that the agreements contained in
_Section 9.3(b)_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without
those agreements, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to make payment of any amount
payable under _Section 9.3(b)_ within the applicable time period specified
in  _Section 9.3(b)_ , as the case may be, and Parent commences a Proceeding
to collect such amount that results in a judgment against the Company, the
Company shall reimburse Parent for its fees and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such Proceeding and
shall pay interest on the amount of the payment at the prime rate
as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date the amount was
payable pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_ , with such interest to accrue beginning
on the date such amount first was payable pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_ , to
the date of payment.

(b)  No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power, remedy

SECTION 10.3. _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement and in any certificate or other writing
delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time.

(a)  This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
and all disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the

regardless of the Law that might otherwise govern under applicable principles
of conflicts of laws thereof.

  



  

(b)  The parties agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to
enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this Agreement or the Transactions (whether brought by any
party or any of its Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates)
shall be brought in the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court shall not
have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of Delaware or
other Delaware state court, and each of the parties irrevocably consents to
the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) (the " _Delaware Courts_ ") in any such suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such
court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action
or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within
or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the
foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided
in _Section 10.1_ shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

  



  

SECTION 10.5. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT

THE TRANSACTIONS.

  



  

SECTION 10.6. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed
in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of
which shall constitute one and the same instrument. The exchange of a fully

this Agreement.

  



  

   

77

 



    



  

SECTION 10.7. _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_.

  



  

(a)  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure
to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns. No
party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party,
except that Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign, in whole or in part,
(i) its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates
and (ii) after the Effective Time, its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to any Person; _provided_ that such transfer or assignment shall not
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter
or change any obligation of any other party or due to Parent or Merger Sub.

  



  

(b)  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer
on any Person other than the parties hereto or their respective heirs,
successors, executors, administrators and assigns any rights, remedies,
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except for
(i) the provisions of _Section 7.9_ with respect to the Indemnified Parties
and (ii) (A) if the Acceptance Time occurs, the right of the Stockholders who
have tendered their shares of Company Common Stock and not validly withdrawn
such shares to receive the Offer Price in accordance with the terms of the
Offer Documents and (B) if the Effective Time occurs, the right of the
Stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, the right of the holders of Company Stock Options to
receive the payments contemplated by _Section 4.4(a)_ , the rights of the
holders of 2017 Company Warrants to receive the payments contemplated by
_Section 4.4(c)_ and the right of participants in the ESPP to receive the
applicable treatment pursuant to _Section 4.5_ , in each case which shall
inure to the benefit of such Persons or holders, as applicable, benefiting
therefrom who shall be third-party beneficiaries thereof and who may
enforce the covenants contained therein. The representations and warranties
in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 10.3_ without notice or
liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the
knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the
parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date
of this Agreement or as of any other date.

  



  

SECTION 10.8. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions
be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

   

78

 



    



  

SECTION 10.9. _Entire Agreement; No Reliance_. This Agreement (including all
the Company Disclosure Letter and all Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules referred
to herein), the Support Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 10.10. _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, except as
expressly provided in the following sentence. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Courts and, in any
action for specific performance, each party waives the defense of adequacy
of a remedy at law and waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity (subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement). The parties hereto further agree
that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section 10.10_ , a
party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of
relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement
(including monetary damages) for breach of any of the provisions of this
Agreement or in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the
event that the remedies provided for in this _Section 10.10_ are not available
or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section
10.10_ shall require any party hereto to institute any Proceeding for (or
limit any party's right to institute any Proceeding for) specific performance
under this _Section 10.10_ prior or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under _Article 9_ (and pursuing damages after such
termination).

  



  

SECTION 10.11. _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this Agreement will
be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this
Agreement, at law or in equity. The exercise by a party to this Agreement of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy.

ANNEX I

  



  

 _Offer Conditions_

  



  

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, but subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, in addition to Merger Sub's right
or obligation to extend, or right to amend or terminate, the Offer in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall be required to accept for payment or, subject to any
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under
the Exchange Act (relating to Merger Sub's obligation to pay for or return
Tendered Shares promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay
for any Tendered Shares, if as of immediately prior to one minute after 11:59
p.m., New York City time, on the Expiration Date any of the conditions set
forth below shall not be satisfied or waived in writing by Parent and
Merger Sub (to the extent waivable by Parent and Merger Sub):

  



  

(a)  there shall not have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
that number of shares of Company Common Stock (excluding any shares of
Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that
have not yet been received, as defined by Section 251(h)(6) of the DGCL)
that, when added to the shares of Company Common Stock then owned by Parent
and its controlled Affiliates, would represent one share more than one half
of the sum of (i) all shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding at the
Expiration Date and (ii) all shares of Company Common Stock that the Company
may be required to issue upon the vesting (including vesting solely as a
result of the consummation of the Offer), conversion, settlement or exercise
of all then outstanding warrants, options, benefit plans, obligations or
securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of Company Common Stock, or
other rights to acquire or be issued shares of Company Common Stock
((including all then outstanding Company Stock Options and Company
Warrants), regardless of the conversion or exercise price or other terms and
conditions thereof) (such condition in this _paragraph (a)_ , the " _Minimum
Condition_ ");

  



  

(b)  any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the
consummation of the Offer and the Merger under the HSR Act shall not have
been terminated or shall not have expired, or any other clearance, approval or
consent under any other applicable Antitrust Law shall not have been
obtained;

  



  

(c)  any of the following events, conditions, circumstances, state of facts
or developments shall exist or has occurred and be continuing:

  



  

(i) any Judgment preventing the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger shall have been issued by any Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction and remain in effect, or there shall be any Law enacted or deemed
applicable to the Offer or the Merger that makes consummation of the Offer or
the Merger illegal;

  



  

(ii) there shall be instituted, pending or threatened in writing
any Proceeding by any Governmental Authority seeking (1) any Non-Required
Remedy or (2) to enjoin, make illegal or otherwise prohibit the consummation
of the Offer Closing or the Merger (the conditions set forth in clause (b)
and this clause (c), the " _Antitrust and Judgment/Illegality Conditions_ ");

  



  

   

I-1

 



    



  

(iii)  the Company and Parent shall have agreed in writing that the
Offer or this Agreement be terminated, or this Agreement shall have been
terminated in accordance with its terms;

  



  

(iv)  (1) any of the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in _Section 5.1_ , _Section 5.3(a)_ , _Section 5.3(b)(i)_ ,
_Section 5.4_ , _Section 5.10_ , _Section 5.13_ and _Section 5.23_ shall not
be true and correct in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement
and as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date
(except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as
of such earlier date), (2) any of the representation and warranties of the
Company set forth in Section 5.2 shall not be true and correct in all respects
(other than _de minimis_ inaccuracies) as of the date of this Agreement and
as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date (except to the
extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier
date), (3) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
in _Section 5.7(a)_ shall not be true and correct in all respects as of the
date of this Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as
of such date (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in
which case as of such earlier date) or (4) any representations and warranties
of the Company set forth in this Agreement (other than those listed in the
preceding _clause (c)(iv)(1)_, _clause (c)(iv)(2)_ , or _clause (c)(iv)(3)_ )
shall not be true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation on any
representation or warranty indicated by the words "Company Material Adverse
Effect," "in all material respects," "in any material respect," "material"
or "materially") as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Expiration
Date as though made on and as of such date (except to the extent expressly
made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), except, in
the case of this  _clause (c)(iv)(4),_ where the failure of any such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not, and would
not be reasonably expected to, have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect;

  



  

(v) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in any
material respect with any obligation, agreement or covenant required to be
performed or complied with by it under this Agreement prior to the Expiration
Date; or

  



  

(vi)  since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred
any event, condition, change, occurrence or development of a state of facts
that has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; or

  



  

(d)  Parent shall not have received a certificate signed on behalf of the
Company by the chief executive officer or chief financial officer of the
Company to the effect that none of the conditions in _clauses (c)(iv)_ ,
_(c)(v)_ , and _(c)(vi)_ of this _Annex I_ shall have occurred and be
continuing.

  



  

   

I-2

 



    



  

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub,
may be asserted by Parent or Merger Sub regardless of the circumstances giving
rise to any such conditions, and may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in
whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion;
_provided_ that the Minimum Condition and the Antitrust and
Judgment/Illegality Conditions (other than the condition in _sub-clause
(c)(ii)(1)_ of this _Annex I_ which may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub in
their sole discretion) may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub only with the
prior written consent of the Company, which may be granted or withheld in the
Company's sole discretion. The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be
asserted at any time and from time to time. All capitalized terms used but not
defined in this _Annex I_  shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the
Agreement to which this _Annex I_ is attached.
