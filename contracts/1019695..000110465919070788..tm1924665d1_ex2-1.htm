published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date the amount was payable pursuant to <U>Section 9.3(b)</U>, with such
interest to accrue beginning on the date such amount first was payable pursuant to <U>Section 9.3(b)</U>, to the date of payment.</P>

This Agreement (including all the Company Disclosure Letter and all Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules referred to herein), the Support

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 1in">SECTION 10.10. <U>Enforcement</U>. The parties
agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, except
as expressly provided in the following sentence. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement in the Delaware Courts and, in any action for specific performance, each party waives the defense of adequacy of
a remedy at law and waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity (subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement).
The parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this <U>Section 10.10</U>, a party shall not
in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement (including
monetary damages) for breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement or in the event that this Agreement has been terminated
or in the event that the remedies provided for in this <U>Section 10.10</U> are not available or otherwise are not granted, and
(ii) nothing set forth in this <U>Section 10.10</U> shall require any party hereto to institute any Proceeding for (or limit any
party&#8217;s right to institute any Proceeding for) specific performance under this <U>Section 10.10</U> prior or as a condition
to exercising any termination right under <U>Article 9</U> (and pursuing damages after such termination).</P>

otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this Agreement will be cumulative

Agreement of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy.</P>
