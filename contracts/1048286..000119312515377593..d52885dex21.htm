-6-  automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist. As of the

(c) _Cancellation of Treasury and Subsidiary Owned Shares of Holdco_. Each
share of Holdco Common Stock held in the treasury of Holdco or held by any of

(i) Each Starwood Equity Award outstanding as of the Starwood Merger Effective

same terms and exercise price, if applicable) and, following such conversion,

Awards_ ," " _Holdco RSU Awards_ ," " _Holdco Performance Share Awards_ " and

(ii) Each Holdco Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding

applicable to such Holdco Option under the applicable Starwood plan and award
agreement in effect immediately prior to the Starwood Merger Effective Time,
(A) that number of shares of Marriott Common Stock, rounded down to the
nearest whole share, equal to the product determined by multiplying (I) the
total number of shares of Holdco Common Stock subject to such Holdco Option
immediately prior to the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time by (II) the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio, and (B) at a per-share exercise price, rounded up
to the nearest whole cent, equal to the quotient determined by dividing (I)

stock award on the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting
requirements) applicable to such Holdco Restricted Stock Award under the
applicable Starwood plan and award agreement in effect immediately prior to
the Starwood Merger Effective Time, with respect to a number of shares of

Merger Effective Time by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio.

(iv) Each Holdco RSU Award, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time shall, as of the
Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, automatically and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a Marriott restricted stock
unit award on the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting
requirements) applicable to such Holdco RSU Award under the applicable
Starwood plan and award agreement in effect immediately prior to the
Starwood Merger Effective Time, with respect to a number of shares of
Marriott Common Stock, rounded up or down to the nearest whole share,
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Holdco Common Stock subject
to such Holdco RSU Award immediately prior to the Initial Holdco Merger
Effective Time by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio.

(v) Each Holdco Performance Share Award that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time shall, as of the Initial Holdco
Merger Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into an award of Marriott restricted stock units
with respect to a number of shares of Marriott Common Stock, rounded up or
down to the nearest whole share, determined by multiplying the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio by the number of shares of Holdco Common Stock that the holder
would be eligible to receive, as determined by Starwood, in consultation with
Marriott and in accordance with the terms of the applicable Starwood Equity
Plan and award agreement, immediately prior to the Initial Holdco Merger
Effective Time, based on the greater of (x) achievement of applicable
performance goals at target level performance with respect to such award and
(y) actual achievement of applicable performance goals as of the Initial

be subject to the same terms and conditions (excluding performance goals and
proration upon termination of employment) as were applicable to the Holdco
Performance Share Award immediately prior to the Initial Holdco Merger
Effective Time.

(vi) Each Holdco Deferred Stock Unit Award that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time shall, as of the Initial

-8-  Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into a Marriott deferred stock unit award on the
same terms and conditions applicable to such Holdco Deferred Stock Unit Award
under the applicable Starwood plan and award agreement in effect immediately
prior to the Starwood Merger Effective Time, with respect to a number of
shares of Marriott Common Stock, rounded up or down to the nearest whole
share, determined by multiplying the number of shares of Holdco Common Stock
subject to such Holdco Deferred Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the
Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio.

 

(vii) Prior to the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of Starwood or the appropriate committee thereof shall adopt
resolutions providing for the treatment of the Starwood Options, Starwood
Restricted Stock Awards, Starwood RSU Awards, Starwood Performance Share

(e) _Treatment of Starwood Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Prior to the
Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Starwood or
the appropriate committee thereof shall take all reasonable actions, including
adopting any necessary resolutions or amendments with respect to the Starwood
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Starwood ESPP_ ") to effectuate the
following: (i) to cause the "Purchase Period" (as defined in the Starwood

-9- SECTION 2.2 _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. No later than five business days prior to the mailing of
the Joint Proxy Statement, Marriott shall designate a bank, trust company or
nationally recognized stockholder services provider, which shall be acceptable
to Starwood (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the purpose of exchanging, in
accordance with this _Article II_ , Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for
the Merger Consideration. Marriott shall deliver to the Exchange Agent, as
needed, (i) cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)(i)_ (together with any cash
payable in lieu of fractional shares of Marriott Common Stock, the " _Exchange
Fund_ ") and, (ii) certificates or book-entry shares representing a sufficient
number of shares of Marriott Common Stock to be delivered as the Stock Merger
Consideration (including the Excess Shares to be sold by the Exchange Agent
pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_) in respect of the shares of Holdco Common
Stock. Marriott shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Agreement.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall, and Marriott
shall cause the Exchange Agent to, mail to each holder of record of a
certificate that immediately prior to the Starwood Merger Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Starwood Common Stock whose shares were
converted into the right to receive the Starwood Merger Consideration (a "
_Certificate_ "), which, by virtue of the Initial Holdco Merger, was
subsequently converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Marriott and the Exchange Agent
may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Marriott, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by Marriott or the Exchange Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article II_ , and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Promptly after the Initial Holdco Merger Effective
Time, Marriott shall cause the Exchange Agent to issue and send to each holder
of uncertificated shares of Starwood Common Stock represented by book
entry that were converted into the right to receive the Starwood Merger
Consideration (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), which, by virtue of the Initial
Holdco Merger were subsequently converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ , without such holder
being required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal
to the Exchange Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be
cancelled. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in
the name of or paid to a person other than the person in whose name the
applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to
such registration or payment that

 



-10-  the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the person requesting such registration or
payment of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of such registration in the name of
or payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered or cancelled as
contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender or cancellation the
Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue for the
benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender or cancellation of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Marriott Common Stock with a record date
after the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate or uncancelled Book-Entry Share with respect to
any shares of Marriott Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment
in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
_Section 2.2(e)_, in each case until the surrender or cancellation of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject
to the effect of Applicable Laws, following surrender or cancellation of any
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to the holder of
shares of Marriott Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) at the time of such surrender or cancellation, the amount of any
cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Marriott Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section 2.2(e)_ and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Initial Holdco
Merger Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Marriott
Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Initial Holdco
Merger Effective Time but prior to such surrender or cancellation and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender or cancellation payable
with respect to such shares of Marriott Common Stock.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Starwood Common Stock_. The
Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange or cancellation of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_ (including any cash paid pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_, 
_Section 2.2(c)_ or _Section 2.2(e)_) shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Holdco Common
Stock (and any rights to receive shares of Holdco Common Stock as a result
of the Starwood Merger) theretofore represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, subject, however, to the obligation of Marriott to pay any
dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the
Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time that may have been declared or made by
Starwood on such shares of Starwood Common Stock in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and that remain unpaid at the Initial Holdco Merger
Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of (i) the Starwood Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Starwood Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Starwood Merger Effective Time and (ii) the Initial Holdco Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Holdco Common Stock that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time. If,
after the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to Marriott or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_ , except as
otherwise provided by Applicable Law.

 



-11- (e) _Fractional Shares_.

 

(i) No certificates representing fractional shares of Marriott Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange or cancellation of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests shall
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder
of Marriott.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Starwood Common Stock converted pursuant to the Starwood Merger
into the right to receive the Starwood Merger Consideration, which was
thereafter converted pursuant to the Initial Holdco Merger into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (other than with respect to Starwood
Equity Awards and Holdco Equity Awards described in _Section 2.1(d)_), who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Marriott Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by
such holder and Book-Entry Shares held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fraction as
determined below. As promptly as practicable following the Initial Holdco
Merger Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (i)
the number of full shares of Marriott Common Stock represented by the
aggregate Stock Merger Consideration (without giving effect to the preceding
paragraph (i)) over (ii) the aggregate number of full shares of Marriott
Common Stock to actually be distributed to holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares (after giving effect to the preceding paragraph (i)) (such excess
being herein referred to as the " _Excess Shares_ "). As soon as practicable
after the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent
for such holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, shall sell the Excess
Shares at then prevailing prices on NASDAQ, all in the manner provided
herein. 

(iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on
NASDAQ and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until
the net proceeds of any such sale or sales have been distributed to the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the Exchange Agent shall hold
such proceeds in trust for such holders. The net proceeds of any such sale or
sales of Excess Shares to be distributed to the holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be reduced by any and all commissions, transfer Taxes
and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, as well as any expenses, of the
Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale or sales. The Exchange
Agent shall determine the portion of such net proceeds to which each holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying
the amount of the aggregate net proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares is entitled (after taking into account all
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares then held by such holder) and the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to
which all holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are entitled. As soon
as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be
paid to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares with respect to any
fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly pay such amounts
to such holders subject to and in accordance with this _Section 2.2(e)_.

 



-12- (f) _Return of Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for one year after the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time shall be delivered
to Marriott, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall
thereafter be entitled to look only to Marriott for payment of their claim for
any shares of Marriott Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Marriott Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to
Marriott Common Stock.

(g) _No Liability_. None of the parties hereto or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any person in respect of any portion of the Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been
surrendered or cancelled prior to seven years after the Initial Holdco Merger
Effective Time, or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any cash,
any shares of Marriott Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Marriott Common Stock or any dividends or other distributions with respect to
Marriott Common Stock in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any
such shares, cash, dividends or other distributions in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, become the property of Marriott, free and clear of all claims
or interests of any person previously entitled thereto.

(h) _Investment of Merger Consideration_. The Exchange Agent shall invest
the aggregate Cash Merger Consideration delivered by Marriott pursuant to
Section 2.2(a)(i) and any proceeds from the sale of Excess Shares pursuant to
_Section 2.2(e)_ as directed by Marriott; _provided_ , that no losses on
such investments shall affect the cash payable to former holders of shares of
Starwood Common Stock or Holdco Common Stock pursuant to this _Article II_.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Marriott.

 

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the parties hereto and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax law.
To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over to
or deposited with the proper Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Marriott or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Marriott or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, may direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Marriott Common Stock, and unpaid dividends and other
distributions on shares of Marriott Common Stock deliverable in respect
thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(k) _Exchange of Shares in the Starwood Merger_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, there shall be no exchange of certificates or book entry
shares in the Starwood Merger and, in lieu thereof, the holders of
certificates or book entry shares of Starwood that were converted into the
right to receive shares of Holdco Common Stock in the Starwood Merger
shall participate with respect to such shares of Holdco Common Stock solely
in the exchange procedures provided above in this _Section 2.2_ with respect
to the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to the Initial Holdco
Merger.

 



-13- SECTION 2.3 _Certain Adjustments_. If between the date of this Agreement and
the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Starwood
Common Stock or Marriott Common Stock are changed into a different number of
shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares, dividend payable in stock or other
securities or other similar transaction (other than the Spin-Off), the
Exchange Ratio and related provisions shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide to the holders of Starwood Common Stock and Marriott Common Stock or
Starwood Equity Awards the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange, dividend or other similar transaction; _provided_ , for
the avoidance of doubt, that (i) nothing in this _Section 2.3_ shall be
construed to permit Starwood or Marriott to take any action with respect to
its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement and (ii) cash
dividends, share repurchases and grants of equity compensation in each case
made in the ordinary course of business and consistent with the terms hereof
shall not result in any adjustment to the Exchange Ratio.

 

SECTION 2.4 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Initial Holdco Merger
Effective Time, the officers and directors or managers, as applicable, of
Marriott and the Initial Holdco Surviving Corporation or the Final Surviving
Company, as applicable, shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of Starwood, Holdco, the Final Surviving Company or
Marriott, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and
do, in the name and on behalf thereof, any other actions and things necessary
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in Marriott, any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets acquired or to be acquired by Marriott as a result of, or in connection
with, the Combination Transactions.

registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements,
certifications and other documents (including exhibits and all other
information incorporated therein) with the SEC since January 1, 2013 (the "
_Starwood SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates (or, if amended, as
of the date of such amendment), the Starwood SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, as amended (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be,
and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to
the Starwood SEC Documents, and none of the Starwood SEC Documents when filed
(or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment) and at their respective
effective times, if applicable, contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments received from

material respects in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Starwood and
its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments which are not material and to any other adjustments described
therein, including the notes thereto).

balance sheet as of September 30, 2015 (or the notes thereto) as included in
the Starwood Filed SEC Documents, (B) for liabilities and obligations incurred
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since
September 30, 2015 and (C) for liabilities and obligations incurred in
connection with or contemplated by this Agreement, neither Starwood nor any of
its subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required by GAAP to
be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of Starwood and its subsidiaries
(or in the notes thereto) that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Starwood.

 

(iv) Starwood maintains a system of "internal control over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) designed to provide reasonable assurance (A) that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP, consistently applied, (B) that transactions are
executed only in accordance with the authorization of management and (C)
regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of Starwoods properties or assets. Since January 1,
2013, Starwood has disclosed to its auditors and the audit committee of
Starwoods Board of Directors any written notification of any (1) "significant
deficiency" in the internal control over financial reporting of Starwood, (2)
"material weakness" in the internal control over financial reporting of
Starwood or (3) fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees of Starwood who have a significant role in the
internal controls over financial reporting of Starwood. Starwood has made
available to Marriott all such disclosures made by Starwood since January 1,
2014 to its auditors or the audit committee of Starwoods Board of Directors
to the date of this Agreement.

(v) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) utilized by Starwood are designed to
ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by Starwood in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to
the management of Starwood, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of Starwood to make the certifications required under
the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

(vi) Neither Starwood nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Starwood and any
of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Starwood or any of
its subsidiaries in Starwoods or such subsidiarys published financial
statements or other Starwood SEC Documents.

 



-19- (f) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied

the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time
it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement
will, at the date it is first mailed to Starwoods stockholders or at the
time of the Starwood Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Form S-4 and the
Joint Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made by
Starwood with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein
based on or derived from information supplied by Marriott specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement.

(g) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(i) From September 30, 2015 through the date of this Agreement, the businesses

in the ordinary course of business in a manner consistent with past practice,
except in connection with the Spin-Off or this Agreement and the discussions,

Governmental Entities

 



-20-  that are required for the operation of the businesses of Starwood and its
subsidiaries (the " _Starwood Permits_ "), except where the failure to have
any such Starwood Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Starwood. Starwood
and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Starwood Permits
and all applicable laws, statutes, orders, rules, regulations, policies or
guidelines promulgated, or judgments, decisions or orders entered by any
Governmental Entity (collectively, " _Applicable Laws_ ") relating to Starwood
and its subsidiaries or their respective businesses or properties, except
where the failure to be in compliance with such Applicable Laws, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Starwood. No action, demand, requirement or
investigation by any Governmental Entity and no suit, action, investigation
or proceeding by any person, in each case with respect to Starwood or any of
its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, is pending or, to the
knowledge of Starwood, threatened, other than, in each case, those the

qualified and Starwood is not aware of any event occurring after the date of
such determination that would adversely affect such determination, except for
any such events that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Starwood. No condition exists
that is reasonably likely to subject Starwood or any Starwood ERISA Affiliate
to any direct or indirect liability under Title IV of ERISA or to a civil
penalty under Section 502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA or liability under Section
4069 of ERISA or Section 4975, 4976, or 4980B of the Code or other liability
with respect to the Starwood Benefit Plans, in each case that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Starwood. There are no pending or, to the knowledge of
Starwood, threatened, claims (other than routine claims for benefits or
immaterial claims) by, on behalf of or against any of the Starwood Benefit
Plans or any trusts related thereto except where such claims would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Starwood.

on, arising out of, in connection with, or otherwise relating to the
employment of, or termination of employment by, Starwood of any person.

controls over financial reporting of Marriott. Marriott has made available to
Starwood all such disclosures made by Marriott since January 1, 2014 to its
auditors or the audit committee of Marriotts Board of Directors to the date
of this Agreement.

(v) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) utilized by Marriott are designed to
ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by Marriott in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of Marriott, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of Marriott to make the certifications required under
the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

(vi) Neither Marriott nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to, or has
any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Marriott and any
of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Marriott or any of
its subsidiaries in Marriotts or such subsidiarys published financial
statements or other Marriott SEC Documents.

(f) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Marriott specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at
any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the

 



-36-  statements therein not misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at
the date it is first mailed to Marriotts stockholders or at the time of the
Marriott Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Form S-4 and the
Joint Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made
by Marriott with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein based on or derived from information supplied by Starwood specifically
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement.

 

(g) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(i) From September 30, 2015 through the date of this Agreement, the businesses
of Marriott and its subsidiaries have been conducted in all material respects
in the ordinary course of business in a manner consistent with past practice,
except for the execution and performance of this Agreement and the
discussions, negotiations, actions and transactions related thereto. 

(ii) Since September 30, 2015, there have been no Effects that, individually
or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Marriott.

(h) _Compliance with Applicable Laws; Outstanding Orders_. 

(i) Marriott, its subsidiaries and employees hold all permits, licenses,
variances, exemptions, orders, registrations and approvals of all
Governmental Entities that are required for the operation of the businesses of
Marriott and its subsidiaries (the "Marriott _Permits_ "), except where the
failure to have any such Marriott Permits, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Marriott. Marriott and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of
the Marriott Permits and all Applicable Laws relating to Marriott and its
subsidiaries or their respective businesses or properties, except where the
failure to be in compliance with such Applicable Laws, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Marriott. No action, demand, requirement or investigation by any
Governmental Entity and no suit, action, investigation or proceeding by any
person, in each case with respect to Marriott or any of its subsidiaries or
any of their respective properties, is pending or, to the knowledge of
Marriott, threatened, other than, in each case, those the outcome of which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Marriott.

 

(ii) Neither Marriott nor any of its subsidiaries is subject to any
outstanding order, injunction or decree that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Marriott.

 



-37- (i) _Litigation_. There is no Action pending against or, to the knowledge of
Marriott, threatened against or affecting Marriott or any of its subsidiaries
or any of their respective properties or any of their respective officers or
directors before any court or arbitrator or any Governmental Entity except as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Marriott.

(j) _Marriott Benefit Plans and Labor Matters_.

(i) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Marriott, each Marriott Benefit
Plan is in compliance with all Applicable Laws, including the ERISA and the
Code. The Internal Revenue Service has determined that each Marriott Benefit
Plan that is intended to be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code
is so qualified and Marriott is not aware of any event occurring after the
date of such determination that would adversely affect such determination,
except for any such events that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Marriott. No
condition exists that is reasonably likely to subject Marriott or any Marriott
ERISA Affiliate to any direct or indirect liability under Title IV of ERISA or
to a civil penalty under Section 502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA or liability under
Section 4069 of ERISA or Section 4975, 4976, or 4980B of the Code or other
liability with respect to the Marriott Benefit Plans, in each case that

sublicenses, agreements or permissions, all items of Intellectual Property
necessary for their operations, as currently conducted or as contemplated by
them to be conducted, except where the failure to own or have such rights,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Marriott. The conduct of Marriotts and its
subsidiaries businesses, as currently conducted or contemplated by them to be

knowledge of Marriott, threatened or otherwise adversely affecting the
Intellectual Property rights of Marriott, except for claims
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Marriott. Since January 1, 2013, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Marriott, neither Marriott nor any of its
subsidiaries has received any (i) written notice, claim or indemnification
request asserting that the conduct of Marriotts and its subsidiaries
businesses infringes, misappropriates, violates or dilutes any of the
Intellectual Property rights of any third party or (ii) written request that
Marriott or any of its subsidiaries take a license under any patents owned by
a third party which such license would entail material obligations. To the
knowledge of Marriott, no third party has interfered with, infringed upon,
misappropriated, diluted, violated or otherwise come into conflict with any
Intellectual Property rights of Marriott or any of its subsidiaries, except
for interferences, infringements, misappropriations, dilutions or violations
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Marriott.

nation" status or any other agreement or obligation (in each case other than
brand-specific radius restrictions in management or franchise agreements

any material respect the manner in which, or the localities in which, the
businesses of Marriott and its

 



-41-  subsidiaries, taken as a whole, is or would be conducted (all contracts of

_Marriott Material Contracts_ "). Marriott has delivered or made available to
Starwood, prior to the execution of this Agreement, true and complete copies
of all Marriott Material Contracts not filed as exhibits to the Marriott Filed
SEC Documents. Each Marriott Material Contract is valid and binding on
Marriott (or, to the extent a subsidiary of Marriott is a party, such
subsidiary) and is in full force and effect, and Marriott and each subsidiary
of Marriott have in all material respects performed all obligations required
to be performed by them to date under each Marriott Material Contract, except
where such noncompliance, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Marriott. Neither
Marriott nor any of its subsidiaries has knowledge of, or has received written
notice of, any violation or default under (nor, to the knowledge of Marriott,
does there exist any condition that with the passage of time or the giving of
notice or both would result in such a violation or default under) any Marriott
Material Contract. To the knowledge of Marriott, no other party to any
Marriott Material Contract is in breach of or default under the terms of any
Marriott Material Contract where such default has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Marriott.

SECTION 4.2 _No Solicitation by Starwood_. (a) Each of Starwood and Holdco
shall not, shall not authorize or permit any of its controlled affiliates or
any of its or their officers, directors or employees to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause any investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant or other representative (a " _Representative_ ")
retained by it or any of its controlled affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the
consummation of which would constitute a Starwood Alternative Transaction or
(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person (except to
notify such person of the existence of the provisions of this  _Section
4.2_), with respect to any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal
the consummation of which would constitute a Starwood Alternative Transaction;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if, at any time prior to obtaining the Starwood
Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of Starwood determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that any such proposal that did not result
from a breach of this _Section 4.2(a)_ constitutes or is reasonably likely
to lead to a Starwood Superior Proposal, subject to compliance with _Section
4.2(c)_, Starwood and its Representatives may (A) furnish information
with respect to Starwood and its subsidiaries to the person making such
proposal (and its Representatives and financing sources) ( _provided_ that any
such information that is nonpublic has previously been provided to Marriott or
is provided to Marriott prior to or substantially concurrent with the time

 



-54-  it is provided to such person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement containing terms as to confidentiality and non-use generally no less
restrictive than the terms of the confidentiality agreement, dated July 15,
2015, entered into between Starwood and Marriott (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") (for the avoidance of doubt, any such confidentiality agreement
need not include explicit or implicit standstill restrictions or otherwise
restrict the making, amending or modifying of a proposal regarding a Starwood
Alternative Transaction) and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the person making such proposal (and its Representatives and financing
sources). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Starwood Alternative Transaction_
" means any of (i) a transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which
any person (or group of persons) other than Marriott and its subsidiaries
(including Marriott Corporate Merger Sub and Marriott LLC Merger Sub) (a "
_Starwood Third Party_ "), acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly,
beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of
more than 25% of the outstanding shares of Starwood Common Stock or Holdco
Common Stock or securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities)
representing 25% or more of the voting power of Starwood or Holdco, including
pursuant to a stock purchase, merger, consolidation, share exchange or similar
transaction involving Starwood, Holdco or any of their respective
subsidiaries, (ii) any transaction pursuant to which any Starwood Third Party
acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, control of assets
(including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries
of Starwood or Holdco and any entity surviving any merger or combination
including any of them) of Starwood, Holdco or any of their respective
subsidiaries representing 25% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income
or assets of Starwood (or, following the Starwood Merger, Holdco) and
its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (iii) any disposition of assets
representing 25% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of
Starwood (or, following the Starwood Merger, Holdco) and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole;  _provided_ that the Venus-ILG Transaction, the Spin-Off or
any other transaction or series of transactions related solely to the assets,
capital stock or business of Venus shall not be deemed a Starwood Alternative
Transaction.

 

(b) Except as permitted by this _Section 4.2(b)_, neither the Board of
Directors of Starwood nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify
or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
adverse to Marriott, the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors
or such committee of the Starwood Merger, the Initial Holdco Merger or this
Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Starwood Alternative Transaction (any action in clause (i) or
this clause (ii) being referred to as a " _Starwood Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ") or (iii) cause or permit Starwood, Holdco or any of their
respective controlled affiliates to enter into any letter of intent, agreement
in principle, term sheet, acquisition agreement or other agreement providing
for any Starwood Alternative Transaction (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in _Section 4.2(a)_). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that prior to obtaining the Starwood Stockholder Approval, the
Board of Directors of Starwood determines in good faith, after it has
received a Starwood Superior Proposal (and after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its duties under Applicable Law,
the Board of Directors of Starwood may (subject to this and the following
sentences) (A) effect a Starwood Adverse Recommendation Change or (B)
terminate this Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement
providing for such Starwood Superior Proposal (subject to the satisfaction of
its obligations under Section 7.2(b)),

 



-55-  but in the case of each of clauses (A) and (B), only (i) at a time that is
after (x) the fifth business day following Marriotts receipt of written
notice from Starwood advising Marriott that the Board of Directors of
Starwood has received a Starwood Superior Proposal specifying the material
terms and conditions of such Starwood Superior Proposal, identifying the
person making such Starwood Superior Proposal and stating that it intends to
make a Starwood Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement and
(y) Starwood has negotiated in good faith with Marriott during such five
business day period (to the extent Marriott desires to negotiate) with
respect to any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement proposed by Marriott in response to the Starwood Superior Proposal
and (ii) following the Board of Directors of Starwood having taken into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Marriott and
any other information provided by Marriott in response to such notice;
_provided_ that in the event of a subsequent modification to the material
terms and conditions of such Starwood Superior Proposal, a new notice shall
be delivered and a period of negotiation commenced, which period shall be
three business days. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Starwood Superior
Proposal_ " means any bona fide written proposal (on its most recently
amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a Starwood Third
Party to enter into a Starwood Alternative Transaction (with all references to
25% in the definition of Starwood Alternative Transaction being treated as
references to 50% for these purposes) that (1) did not result from a breach of
_Section 4.2(a)_, (2) is on terms that the Board of Directors of Starwood
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be more favorable
from a financial point of view to Starwoods stockholders than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account all relevant
factors (including any changes to this Agreement that may be proposed by
Marriott) and (3) that the Board of Directors of Starwood determines in good
faith is reasonably likely to be completed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal. In addition,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior
to the receipt of the Starwood Stockholder Approval, if the Board of Directors
of Starwood determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the failure
to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its duties under
Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of Starwood may effect a Starwood
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event, but only
(i) at a time that is after (x) the fifth business day following Marriotts
receipt of written notice from Starwood advising Marriott of all material
information with respect to such Intervening Event and stating that it intends
to make a Starwood Adverse Recommendation Change and providing a full
description of its rationale therefor and (y) Starwood has negotiated in good
faith with Marriott during such five business day period (to the extent
Marriott desires to negotiate) with respect to any revisions to the terms of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Marriott in
response to the Intervening Event and (ii) following the Board of Directors
of Starwood having taken into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Marriott and any other information provided by Marriott
in response to such notice. " _Intervening Event_ " means a material event or
circumstance that was not known by the Board of Directors of Marriott or
Starwood, as applicable, on the date of this Agreement (or if known, the
consequences of which were not known by such Board of Directors as of the
date of this Agreement), which event or circumstance, or any consequence
thereof, becomes known by the Board of Directors of such party prior to the
time such party receives the Starwood Stockholder Approval or the
Marriott Stockholder Approval, as applicable; _provided_ ,

 



-56-   _however_ , that in no event shall any change, event or condition that
relates to an inquiry or proposal, the consummation of which would constitute
a Starwood Alternative Transaction or a Marriott Alternative Transaction, as
applicable, constitute an Intervening Event.

(c) In addition to the obligations of Starwood set forth in _Section 4.2(a)_
and _Section 4.2(b)_, Starwood shall promptly, and in any event within 24
hours of receipt thereof, advise Marriott orally and in writing if Starwood or
any of its subsidiaries or their Representatives receives any proposal
relating to a Starwood Alternative Transaction, which notice shall include a
copy of the proposal and the identity of the person making such proposal, and
Starwood shall keep Marriott reasonably informed of the status of any such
proposal (including any material changes, modifications or amendments
thereto).

(d) Nothing contained in this  _Section 4.2_ shall prohibit Starwood from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a
"stop, look and listen" statement or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its
position thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure or
statement that constitutes or contains a Starwood Adverse Recommendation
Change shall be subject to the provisions of _Section 4.2(b)_ (it being
understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that a disclosure that constitutes
only a "stop, look and listen" statement or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not in and of
itself be deemed to be a Starwood Adverse Recommendation Change).

 

SECTION 4.3 _No Solicitation by Marriott_. (a) Marriott shall not, shall not
authorize or permit any of its controlled affiliates or any of its or their
officers, directors or employees to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause any Representative retained by it or any of its controlled affiliates
not to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate
or knowingly encourage any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal
the consummation of which would constitute a Marriott Alternative Transaction
or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person
(except to notify such person of the existence of the provisions of this
_Section 4.3_), with respect to any inquiries regarding, or the making of,
any proposal the consummation of which would constitute a Marriott
Alternative Transaction; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, at any time prior
to obtaining the Marriott Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of
Marriott determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and
a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that any such
proposal that that did not result from a breach of this _Section 4.3(a)_
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Marriott Superior Proposal,
subject to compliance with  _Section 4.3(c)_, Marriott and its
Representatives may (A) furnish information with respect to Marriott and its
subsidiaries to the person making such proposal (and its Representatives and
financing sources) ( _provided_ that any such information that is nonpublic
has previously been provided to Starwood or is provided to Starwood prior to
or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such person)
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement containing terms as to
confidentiality and non-use generally no less restrictive than the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, any such
confidentiality agreement need not include explicit or implicit standstill
restrictions or otherwise restrict the making, amending or modifying of a
proposal regarding a Marriott Alternative Transaction) and (B) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the person making such proposal (and its
Representatives and financing sources). For

 



-57-  purposes of this Agreement, " _Marriott Alternative Transaction_ " means any
of (i) a transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which any person
(or group of persons) other than Starwood and its subsidiaries (including
Holdco and Starwood Merger Sub) (a " _Marriott Third Party_ "), acquires or
would acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership (as defined in
Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of more than 25% of the outstanding shares
of Marriott Common Stock or securities (or options, rights or warrants to
purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities)
representing 25% or more of the voting power of Marriott, including pursuant
to a stock purchase, merger, consolidation, share exchange or similar
transaction involving Marriott or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) any
transaction pursuant to which any Marriott Third Party acquires or
would acquire, directly or indirectly, control of assets (including for this
purpose the outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries of Marriott and any
entity surviving any merger or combination including any of them) of Marriott
or any of its subsidiaries representing 25% or more of the consolidated
revenues, net income or assets of Marriott and its subsidiaries taken as a
whole or (iii) any disposition of assets representing 25% or more of the
consolidated revenues, net income or assets of Marriott and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

(b) Except as permitted by this _Section 4.3(b)_, neither the Board of
Directors of Marriott nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or
modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
adverse to Starwood, the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors
or such committee of the issuance of shares of Marriott Common Stock in the
Initial Holdco Merger, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, any Marriott Alternative Transaction (any action in
clause (i) or this clause (ii) being referred to as a " _Marriott Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (iii) cause or permit Marriott or any of its
controlled affiliates to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, term sheet, acquisition agreement or other agreement providing for
any Marriott Alternative Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in _Section 4.3(a)_). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that prior to obtaining the Marriott Stockholder Approval, the Board of
Directors of Marriott determines in good faith, after it has received a
Marriott Superior Proposal (and after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its duties under Applicable Law, the Board of
Directors of Marriott may (subject to this and the following sentences) (A)
effect a Marriott Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) terminate this
Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for such
Marriott Superior Proposal (subject to the satisfaction of its obligations
under Section 7.2(c)), but in the case of each of clauses (A) and (B),
only (i) at a time that is after (x) the fifth business day following
Starwoods receipt of written notice from Marriott advising Starwood that the
Board of Directors of Marriott has received a Marriott Superior Proposal
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Marriott Superior
Proposal, identifying the person making such Marriott Superior Proposal and
stating that it intends to make a Marriott Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement and (y) Marriott has negotiated in good faith with
Starwood during such five business day period (to the extent Starwood desires
to negotiate) with respect to any revisions to the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Starwood in response to the
Marriott Superior Proposal and (ii) following the Board of Directors of
Marriott having taken into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Starwood and any other information provided by Starwood in
response to such notice; _provided_ that in the event of a subsequent
modification to the material terms and conditions of such

 



-58-  Marriott Superior Proposal, a new notice shall be delivered and a period of
negotiation commenced, which period shall be three business days. For purposes
of this Agreement, a " _Marriott Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide
written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended
or modified) made by a Marriott Third Party to enter into a Marriott
Alternative Transaction (with all references to 25% in the definition of
Marriott Alternative Transaction being treated as references to 50% for these
purposes) that (1) did not result from a breach of _Section 4.3(a)_, (2) is
on terms that the Board of Directors of Marriott determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) to be more favorable from a financial point of view to
Marriotts stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
taking into account all relevant factors (including any changes to this
Agreement that may be proposed by Starwood) and (3) that the Board of
Directors of Marriott determines in good faith is reasonably likely to be
completed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other
aspects of such proposal. In addition, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Marriott
Stockholder Approval, if the Board of Directors of Marriott determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its duties under Applicable Law,
the Board of Directors of Marriott may effect a Marriott Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event, but only (i) at a
time that is after (x) the fifth business day following Starwoods receipt of
written notice from Marriott advising Starwood of all material information
with respect to such Intervening Event and stating that it intends to make a
Marriott Adverse Recommendation Change and providing a full description of its
rationale therefor and (y) Marriott has negotiated in good faith with
Starwood during such five business day period (to the extent Starwood desires
to negotiate) with respect to any revisions to the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Starwood in response to the
Intervening Event and (ii) following the Board of Directors of Marriott having
taken into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Starwood and any other information provided by Starwood in response to such
notice.

(c) In addition to the obligations of Marriott set forth in _Section
4.3(a)_ and _Section 4.3(b)_, Marriott shall promptly, and in any event
within 24 hours of receipt thereof, advise Starwood orally and in writing if
Marriott or any of its subsidiaries or their Representatives receives any
proposal relating to a Marriott Alternative Transaction, which notice shall
include a copy of the proposal and the identity of the person making such
proposal, and Marriott shall keep Starwood reasonably informed of the status
of any such proposal (including any material changes, modifications or
amendments thereto).

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 4.3_ shall prohibit Marriott from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a
"stop, look and listen" statement or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of
its position thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure or
statement that constitutes or contains a Marriott Adverse Recommendation
Change shall be subject to the provisions of _Section 4.3(b)_ (it being
understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that a disclosure that constitutes
only a "stop, look and listen" statement or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not in and of
itself be deemed to be a Marriott Adverse Recommendation Change).

 



-59- ARTICLE V

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

SECTION 5.1 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement;
Stockholders Meetings_. (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Starwood and Marriott shall prepare, and Marriott shall file with
the SEC, the Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement shall be included
as a prospectus. Each of Starwood and Marriott shall use reasonable best
efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing. Starwood and Marriott shall, as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other party copies
of any written comments and advise the other party of any oral comments, with
respect to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement received from the SEC.
Marriott shall provide Starwood with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 prior to filing such
with the SEC, and with a copy of all such filings made with the
SEC. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no amendment
or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the Joint Proxy
Statement or the Form S-4 shall be made without the approval of both Starwood
and Marriott, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed; _provided_ that with respect to documents filed by a party that
are incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement, this
right of approval shall apply only with respect to information relating to
the other party or its business, financial condition or results of operations,
or the combined entity; and _provided_ _further_ , that this approval right
shall not apply with respect to information relating to a Starwood Adverse
Recommendation Change or a Marriott Adverse Recommendation Change. Starwood
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be
mailed to Starwoods stockholders, and Marriott shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to Marriotts
stockholders, in each case as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act. Marriott shall advise
Starwood promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form
S-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the
issuance of any stop order, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the
Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If at any time
prior to the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time any information relating to
Starwood, Marriott or any of their respective affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Starwood or Marriott that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of Starwood and
Marriott.

 

(b) Starwood shall, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act, duly give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _Starwood Stockholders Meeting_ ") in
accordance with the MGCL solely for the purpose of

 



-60-  obtaining the Starwood Stockholder Approval and, if applicable, any
approvals related thereto including the advisory vote required by Rule
14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection therewith, and shall, subject
to the provisions of _Section 4.2(b)_, through its Board of Directors,
recommend to its stockholders the approval of the Starwood Merger and the
Initial Holdco Merger. Starwood may only postpone or adjourn the Starwood
Stockholders Meeting (i) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of
obtaining the Starwood Stockholder Approval, (ii) for the absence of a quorum
and (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing or mailing of
any supplemental or amended disclosure that Starwood has determined after
consultation with outside legal counsel is reasonably likely to be required
under Applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by stockholders of Starwood prior to the Starwood
Stockholders Meeting. In the event that subsequent to the date of this
Agreement, the Board of Directors of Starwood makes a Starwood Adverse
Recommendation Change, Starwood nevertheless shall submit this Agreement to
the holders of shares of Starwood Common Stock for the purpose of obtaining
the Starwood Stockholder Approval unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the Starwood Stockholders
Meeting. Starwood shall permit Marriott and its Representatives to attend the
Starwood Stockholders Meeting.

(c) Marriott shall, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act, duly give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _Marriott Stockholders Meeting_ ") in
accordance with the DGCL solely for the purpose of obtaining the Marriott
Stockholder Approval and, if applicable, any approvals related thereto
including the advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act
in connection therewith, and shall, subject to the provisions of _Section
4.3(b)_, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders the
approval of the issuance of shares of Marriott Common Stock in the Initial
Holdco Merger. Marriott may only postpone or adjourn the Marriott
Stockholders Meeting (i) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of
obtaining the Marriott Stockholder Approval, (ii) for the absence of a quorum
and (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing or mailing of
any supplemental or amended disclosure that Marriott has determined after
consultation with outside legal counsel is reasonably likely to be required
under Applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by stockholders of Marriott prior to the Marriott
Stockholders Meeting. In the event that subsequent to the date of this
Agreement, the Board of Directors of Marriott makes a Marriott Adverse
Recommendation Change, Marriott nevertheless shall submit this Agreement to
the holders of shares of Marriott Common Stock for the purpose of obtaining
the Marriott Stockholder Approval unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the Marriott Stockholders
Meeting. Marriott shall permit Starwood and its Representatives to attend the
Marriott Stockholders Meeting.

(d) Starwood and Marriott shall use reasonable best efforts to hold the
Starwood Stockholders Meeting and the Marriott Stockholders Meeting on the
same date and as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement.

 

SECTION 5.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and subject to Applicable Law, upon reasonable
notice, each of Starwood and Marriott shall, and shall cause each of its
respective subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and to the officers,
employees and Representatives of such other party, reasonable 

 



-61-  access, during normal business hours during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, to all their respective
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records ( _provided_
that such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or
operations of such party), and during such period, each of Starwood and
Marriott shall, and shall cause each of its respective subsidiaries to,
furnish promptly to the other party all information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request. Neither
party nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or
to disclose information where such access or disclosure would (i) breach any
agreement with any third party ( _provided_ that such party shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of the third party to such
disclosure), (ii) constitute a waiver of or jeopardize the attorney-client or
other privilege held by such party or its subsidiaries or (iii) otherwise
violate any Applicable Laws. No review pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ shall
affect any representation or warranty given by the other party hereto. Each
of Starwood and Marriott shall hold, and shall cause its respective
affiliates, officers, employees and Representatives to hold, any nonpublic
information in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

SECTION 5.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Combination
Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using reasonable best efforts for (i) the obtaining of all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Entities, including any required action or non-action under the
Antitrust Laws (the " _Required Consents_ ") prior to the Initial Holdco
Merger Effective Time, and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain a Required
Consent from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity,
(ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers, and any
necessary or appropriate financing arrangements, from third parties, (iii) the
defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any
stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental
Entity vacated or reversed, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In furtherance and
not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make (i) an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable, (ii) appropriate filings, if any are required, pursuant to
foreign Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable and (iii) all other
necessary filings with other Governmental Entities relating to the Combination
Transactions, and, in each case, to supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be formally or
informally requested pursuant to the Antitrust Laws or by such authorities and
to use reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting periods under the Antitrust Laws and the receipt of the
Required Consents as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, neither Starwood nor Marriott shall be required
pursuant to any Antitrust Laws to hold separate (including by trust
or otherwise) or divest any of its businesses or assets or enter into any
consent decree or other agreement that would restrict it in the conduct of its
business as

 



-62-  heretofore conducted if such actions, either by themselves or taken
together, would reasonably be expected to cause greater than $700 million in
lost value to Marriott and its subsidiaries and Starwood and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Lost value for purposes of this analysis shall
consist of:

(A) any one time out-of-pocket costs that Marriott and its subsidiaries or
Starwood and its subsidiaries would incur, if any, to effect a divestment or
other required disposition (whether by termination of management or franchise
agreement or otherwise) of hotels, whether open or pipeline, by Marriott and
its subsidiaries or Starwood and its subsidiaries;

(B) the net present value of the reasonably expected future fee stream of the
management or franchise contract associated with any hotel described in clause
(A) from the date of the applicable divestiture or disposition through the
earliest date such contract could be terminated due to scheduled expiration
of the term of such contract, but taking into account any specified term
extension where either Marriott or Starwood has the unconditional right to
extend (which net present value calculation shall take into account
the reasonably expected future selling, general and administrative expenses
associated with such contract), using a discount rate equal to Marriotts
weighted average cost of capital as reasonably agreed by Marriott and
Starwood; and

 

(C) a multiple of 12 times the amount of EBITDA earned from owned, leased or
joint venture hotels that would be required to be divested or otherwise
disposed of by Marriott and its subsidiaries or Starwood and its subsidiaries,
if any (using EBITDA for 2015 for opened hotels, and projected EBITDA for the
third full year of operations for pipeline hotels or hotels that were not open
for all of 2015);

in each of clauses (A) through (C), without duplication, less the proceeds
received, or reasonably expected to be received, by Marriott and its
subsidiaries and Starwood and its subsidiaries in connection with any such
divesture or other disposition. For purposes of this _Section 5.3_, "
_EBITDA_ " shall mean earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation
and amortization, each as determined in accordance with GAAP, consistently
applied, with such other adjustments as may be mutually agreed by Marriott and
Starwood, and shall include an appropriate allocation for third-party market-
level management fees.

(b) Each of the parties shall consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party, hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law. Each of
the parties shall (i) promptly notify the other party of any communication
received by that party from, or given by it to, any Governmental Entity and,
subject to Applicable Law, permit the other party to review in advance any
proposed communication to any such Governmental Entity and incorporate the
other partys reasonable comments, (ii) not agree to participate in any
meeting or substantive discussion with any such Governmental Entity in respect
of any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the
Combination Transactions unless, to the extent reasonably practicable, it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
(iii)

 



-63-  furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings and
written communications between them and their affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, employees and Representatives, on one hand, and any such
Governmental Entity or its respective staff on the other hand, with respect to
this Agreement and the Combination Transactions, _provided_ that materials
furnished pursuant to this  _Section 5.3(b)_ may be redacted as necessary to
address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality
concerns.

 

SECTION 5.4 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_. (a) From and after
the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, Marriott shall indemnify and hold
harmless each individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who
becomes prior to the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, a director or
officer of Starwood or any of its subsidiaries or who is as of the date
of this Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the Initial Holdco
Merger Effective Time, serving at the request of Starwood, as applicable, or
any of its subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time (including this Agreement
and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby)), arising out of or
pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer or
director of Starwood or any of its subsidiaries or is or was serving at the
request of Starwood or any of its subsidiaries as a director or officer of
another person or in respect of any acts or omissions in their capacities as
such directors or officers occurring prior to the Initial Holdco Merger
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, to the same extent as such Indemnified
Parties are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by Starwood pursuant
to the Starwood Charter, the Starwood By-laws or the governing organizational
documents of any subsidiary of Starwood, as applicable, and any
indemnification agreements with directors and officers of Starwood in
existence as of the date of this Agreement and listed in Section 5.4(a) of the
Starwood Disclosure Letter. In the event of any such claim, action, suit or
proceeding, (i) each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding
from Marriott to the same extent as such Indemnified Parties are entitled to
advance of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by Starwood pursuant to
the Starwood Charter, the Starwood By-laws or the governing or organizational
documents of any subsidiary of Starwood, as applicable, and
any indemnification agreements with directors and officers of Starwood in
existence as of the date of this Agreement and listed in Section 5.4(a) of the
Starwood Disclosure Letter; _provided_ that any person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by
Applicable Law, the Starwood Charter or the Starwood By-laws or the governing
or organizational documents of any Starwood subsidiary, as applicable, and
any indemnification agreements with directors and officers of Starwood in
existence as of the date of this Agreement and listed in Section 5.4(a) of the
Starwood Disclosure Letter, to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification and
(ii) Marriott shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, cooperate in the
defense of any such matter. In the event that Marriott, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each such case, Marriott or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of Marriott or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.4_.

 



-64- (b) For a period of six years from and after the Closing Date, Marriott shall
either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained
by Starwood or any of its subsidiaries or provide substitute polices for not
less than the existing coverage and have other terms not less favorable to
the insured persons with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, except that in
no event shall Marriott be required to pay with respect to such insurance
policies (or substitute insurance policies) of Starwood in respect of any one
policy year more than 300% of the annual premium payable by Starwood for such
insurance for the year ending December 31, 2015 (the " _Annual D andO Cap_"),
and if Marriott is unable to obtain the insurance required by this _Section
5.4_ for any year within such six-year period, it shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as possible for such year for an annual premium equal to
the Annual DandO Cap; _provided_ that in lieu of the foregoing, Starwood may
obtain at or prior to the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time a six-year
"tail" policy under Starwoods existing directors and officers insurance
policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding
sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that
is not in excess of the maximum aggregate amount otherwise payable for
such six-year period under this _Section 5.4(b)_.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 5.4_ (i) shall survive consummation of
the Combination Transactions, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the
Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives,
and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract
or otherwise.

 

SECTION 5.5 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as set forth in this _Section 5.5_
and in _Section 7.2_, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
Combination Transactions, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or
not the Combination Transactions are consummated, except that each of
Marriott and Starwood shall bear and pay one-half of the costs and expenses
(other than the fees and expenses of each partys attorneys and accountants,
which shall be borne by the party incurring such expenses) incurred by the
parties hereto in connection with (i) the filing, printing and mailing of the
Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement (including SEC filing fees) and (ii)
the filings of the pre-merger notification and report forms under the HSR Act
and similar laws of other jurisdictions (including filing fees).

SECTION 5.6 _Public Announcements_. Starwood, Holdco and Starwood Merger Sub,
on the one hand, and Marriott, Marriott Corporate Merger Sub and Marriott LLC
Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall consult with each other before issuing
any press release or making any public statement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent
of the other, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) any such press release or public
statement as may be required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with
any national securities exchange may be issued prior to such consultation if
the party making the release or statement has used its commercially

 



-65-  reasonable efforts to consult with the other party, (b) a party may issue a
press release or make a public statement that is consistent with prior press
releases issued or public statements made in compliance with the first
sentence of this _Section 5.6_ without such consultation and (c) the first
sentence of this _Section 5.6_ shall not apply with respect to communications
relating to a Starwood Adverse Recommendation Change, a Marriott Adverse
Recommendation Change or any proposal for a Starwood Alternative Transaction
or Marriott Alternative Transaction.

 

SECTION 5.7 _NASDAQ Listing_. Marriott shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Marriott Common Stock issuable under _Article II_ to be approved
for listing on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the
Closing Date.

 

SECTION 5.8 _Tax Treatment_. (a) Each of the parties hereto shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Combination Transactions to qualify for
the Intended Tax Treatment, including considering and negotiating in good
faith such amendments to this Agreement as may reasonably be required in order
to obtain such qualification (it being understood that no party shall be
required to agree to any such amendment). The parties shall report the
Combination Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including for U.S. Federal income Tax purposes, in a manner
consistent with such qualification. No party shall take any action, or allow
any affiliate to take any action, that would reasonably be expected to prevent
any of the foregoing.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
delivery of the opinion of counsel referred to in  _Section 6.3(d)_,
including by causing its officers to execute and deliver to counsel letters of
representation customary for transactions of this type at such time or times
as counsel may reasonably request, including at the Closing. The parties
shall use reasonable best efforts not to take or cause to be taken any action
that would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any
action which inaction would cause to be untrue) any of the representations
included in the letters of representation described in this _Section
5.8(b)_.

SECTION 5.9 _Takeover Statutes_. If any antitakeover or similar statute or
regulation is or may become applicable to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, each of the parties hereto and its respective Board of
Directors shall (i) grant such approvals and take all such actions as
are legally permissible so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
(ii) otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such statute or
regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 5.10 _Employee Benefits_. (a) For a period of one year following the
Closing, Marriott shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each employee of
Starwood and its subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Marriott and its
subsidiaries, compensation and benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than the compensation and benefits provided to each such employee
prior to the Closing. In addition, Marriott shall provide, or cause to be
provided, to each employee of Starwood and its subsidiaries who is terminated
on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing with severance benefits
that are no less favorable than the severance benefits provided to each such
employee prior to the Closing. This _Section 5.10(a) _

 



-66-  shall not apply to collectively bargained employees, the terms and
conditions of whose employment shall be determined by the applicable
collective bargaining agreement as in effect from time-to-time.

(b) From and after the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, Marriott shall
cause to be honored all Starwood Benefit Plans in accordance with the terms
thereof. For all purposes under each employee benefit plan of Marriott and its
affiliates providing benefits to any current or former employee of Starwood or
any of their respective affiliates after the Initial Holdco Merger Effective
Time (the " _New Plans_ "), and subject to Applicable Law and obligations
under applicable collective bargaining or similar agreements, each employee
shall be credited with his or her years of service with Starwood or any of
their respective affiliates, as the case may be, before the Initial Holdco
Merger Effective Time, to the same extent as such employee was entitled,
before the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any Starwood Benefit Plan of the same type, as applicable, except to
the extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject to
Applicable Law and obligations under applicable collective bargaining or
similar agreements: (i) each employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans which are
welfare benefit plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces

in each case to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

SECTION 5.13  _Venus-ILG Transaction_. (a) Subject to Section 5.13(a) of the
Starwood Disclosure Letter, neither Starwood nor any of its affiliates shall
agree to any amendment, replacement, or other modification of, or waive any of
its rights under, any Venus Document, without the consent of Marriott (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed if such amendment,
replacement or waiver does not result in the modification of any of the
commercial terms that will govern the continuing commercial relationship
between Starwood and Venus following the consummation of the Venus-ILG
Transaction as reflected in the Venus Documents as in effect on the date
hereof, such as economics, intellectual property rights,
exclusivity provisions, usage limitations, platform usage, systems, customer
data, loyalty program benefits and other similar terms); _provided_ that
Marriott shall not have the right to consent or object to the finalization of
agreements and other documents as contemplated by the Venus Documents in
effect as of the date hereof (provided, that Marriott shall have a right to
review all such documents prior to their finalization) so long as the terms of
such finalized agreements and documents are not inconsistent with the terms
of the Venus Documents as in effect as of the date hereof. Upon any such
amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver of the Venus
Documents in accordance with this _Section 5.13(a)_, the term " _Venus
Documents_ " shall mean the Venus Documents, as so amended, replaced,
supplemented, modified or waived, and Starwood shall provide Marriott with
copies of such amended, replaced, supplemented, modified or waived
Venus Document.

(b) Starwood shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the Venus-ILG Transaction as promptly as practicable
on the terms and conditions described in the Venus Documents including using
its reasonable best efforts to (i) comply with all of its covenants and
agreements set forth in the Venus Documents in accordance with the terms and
subject to the conditions thereof (including any covenants and agreements
related to obtaining (or providing ILG with assistance and cooperation in
its efforts to obtain) the affirmative vote of the shareholders of ILG with
respect to the Venus-ILG Transaction) and (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions precedent to the Venus-ILG Transaction as set forth in the Venus
Documents. Starwood shall keep Marriott reasonably informed of the status of
its efforts to consummate the Venus-ILG Transaction, including by providing
copies of material notices, filings, documents and agreements as promptly as
reasonably practicable after they become available, and, upon the reasonable
request of Marriott, otherwise being reasonably available for

 



-68-  discussion of the status of any matters related to the Venus-ILG
Transaction. Starwood shall give Marriott prompt written notice of (A) any
material breach or purported material breach by any party of any term or
condition of the Venus Documents of which Starwood becomes aware or (B) any
termination or threatened (in writing) termination of the Venus Separation
Agreement or the Venus Merger Agreement.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, and without
limiting in any respect Starwoods obligations to use reasonable best efforts
to consummate the Venus-ILG Transaction pursuant to _Section 5.13(b)_, in the
event the Venus Merger Agreement is terminated or Starwood otherwise fails to
consummate the Venus-ILG Transaction for any reason, Starwood shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take all actions, and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
Spin-Off, in the most expeditious manner practicable, whether pursuant to a
transaction with another third party (whether or not such transaction is
structured in a substantially similar manner to the Venus-ILG Transaction) or
otherwise pursuant to a distribution or exchange of capital stock of Venus to
the stockholders of Starwood (an " _Alternate Venus Disposition Transaction_
"), with the form of Alternate Venus Disposition Transaction being determined
by Starwood; _provided_ that Marriott shall have the right to consent to
the terms of any such Alternate Venus Disposition Transaction that do not
relate solely to the differing structural nature of the Alternate Venus
Disposition Transaction as compared to the Venus-ILG Transaction (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed with respect to terms
that do not result in any amendment or modification of the commercial terms
(such as economics, intellectual property rights, exclusivity provisions,
usage limitations, platform usage, systems, customer data, loyalty program
benefits and other similar terms and, other than in an Alternate Venus
Disposition Transaction that is structured as a sale of Venus for cash, terms
regarding Taxes, which terms are of the type covered by the Form of
Tax Matters Agreement Exhibit to the Venus Separation Agreement) governing
the continuing commercial relationship between Starwood and Venus (or any
entity that acquires or merges, consolidates or combines with Venus in
connection with such transaction). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)
Marriott shall not have the right to consent or object to the purchase price
payable to Starwood in connection with any Alternate Venus Disposition
Transaction that is structured as a sale of Venus for cash and, in the event
of any such transaction, Starwood may dividend or distribute to the holders of
Starwood Common Stock prior to the Closing the net after-tax proceeds received
by Starwood from such transaction (calculated net of costs and expenses, and
net of liabilities for Taxes as mutually determined by Starwood and Venus),
(ii) Marriott shall not have the right to consent or object to the identity of
the counterparty or counterparties in any Alternate Venus
Disposition Transaction and (iii) Marriott may not withhold its consent
solely because any Alternate Venus Disposition Transaction would result in the
incurrence of corporate-level Tax in an amount equal to the amount of Tax that
would be incurred by Starwood as a result of the Venus-ILG Transaction
without the application of Section 355(c) of the Code; _provided_ that such
Alternate Venus Disposition Transaction (other than a sale of Venus for cash)
requires that Starwood is entitled to compensation for any associated tax
benefit in a manner consistent with and substantially similar to the tax
benefit payment provided for in the Venus-ILG Transaction as set forth in
Section 4.06 of the "Form Tax Matters Agreement Exhibit" to the Venus
Separation Agreement. In connection therewith, Starwood shall use reasonable
best efforts to (i) obtain all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents and approvals from Governmental Entities in order to consummate the
Spin-Off, and make all necessary registrations and filings and take all steps
as

 



-69-  may be necessary to obtain any such waiver, consent or approval from, or to
avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) obtain all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers, and any necessary or appropriate
financing arrangements, from third parties and (iii) execute and deliver any
additional instruments, documents or agreements necessary to consummate the
Spin-Off.

 

(d) Marriott shall comply with the terms of Section 5.13(d) of the Starwood
Disclosure Letter.

 

SECTION 5.14 _Coordination of Quarterly Dividends_. Starwood and Marriott
shall each coordinate their record and payment dates for their regular
quarterly dividends to ensure that (a) with respect to the calendar quarter
immediately preceding the calendar quarter in which the Closing Date occurs,
(i) Starwood stockholders shall receive a regular quarterly dividend
from Starwood with respect to such quarter, and (ii) Marriott stockholders
shall receive a regular quarterly dividend from Marriott with respect to such
quarter, and (b) with respect to the calendar quarter in which the Closing
Date occurs, (i) Starwood does not declare or pay a regular quarterly
dividend with respect to such quarter, and (ii) the stockholders of Marriott,
after giving effect to the Initial Holdco Merger, receive a regular quarterly
dividend from Marriott with respect to such quarter (it being understood that
Marriott shall not set a record date for such dividend prior to the Initial
Holdco Merger Effective Time).

and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more

SECTION 8.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported assignment in
violation of the preceding sentence shall be void. Subject to the preceding
two sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of,
and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

 

SECTION 8.9 _Specific Enforcement; Jurisdiction_. The parties acknowledge and
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of
terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to in clause (a)
below, without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of
specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable
for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide
an adequate remedy for any such breach. In addition, each of the parties
hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any
Delaware state court or any federal court located in the State of Delaware in
the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement, the
Combination Transactions or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court
and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement,
the Combination Transactions or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than any Delaware state court or any federal
court sitting in the State of Delaware (except for actions brought to enforce
the judgment of any such Delaware court).

SECTION 8.10 _Headings, etc._ The headings and table of contents contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



-82- SECTION 8.11 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights
under this _Section 8.11_ with respect thereto. Upon a determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.
