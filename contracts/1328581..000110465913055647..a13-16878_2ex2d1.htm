 **LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT**

 



 

THIS LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_
") is made and entered into as of July 19, 2013, by and among (i) BOISE
CASCADE WOOD PRODUCTS, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company organized
under the laws of the State of Delaware (the " _Purchaser_ "), (ii) CHESTER
WOOD PRODUCTS LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the
State of Delaware (" _Chester_ "), (iii) MONCURE PLYWOOD LLC, a limited
liability company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware ("
_Moncure_ " and together with Chester, each a " _Company_ " and collectively
the " _Companies_ "), (iv) WR OPERATING LLC, a limited liability company
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (" _Seller_ "), (v) for the
limited purposes specified herein, BOISE CASCADE COMPANY, a corporation
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (" _Purchaser Guarantor_ "),
and (vi) for the limited purposes specified herein, WOOD RESOURCES LLC, a
limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware ("
_Seller Guarantor_ ").

 



 

 **W I T N E S S E T H:**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Seller is the owner of one hundred percent (100%) of the
limited liability company interests of each Company;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Companies are engaged in the business of manufacturing and
supplying plywood and lumber products, operating plywood mills and a saw mill,
and activities ancillary thereto (collectively, the " _Business_ ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , subject to the terms and conditions herein contained, Seller
desires to sell and transfer to Purchaser, and Purchaser desires to acquire
from Seller, all of the outstanding limited liability company interests of the
Companies (collectively, the " _Interests_ "); and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , _Article 13_ hereof provides cross-references to certain
capitalized terms defined in this Agreement.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , for and in consideration of the premises and the mutual
covenants and agreements herein contained, and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

 **1.** ** ****_PURCHASE AND SALE OF INTEREST_** **.**

 



 

 **1.1** ** ****_Purchase and Sale_**. Subject to the terms and conditions
contained herein, Seller agrees to sell, transfer, convey, deliver and assign
the Interests to Purchaser at the Closing, free and clear of any Encumbrances
except Encumbrances arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
" _Securities Act_ "), and applicable state securities laws, and Purchaser
agrees to purchase and acquire the Interests from Seller at the Closing.

 



 

 **1.2** ** ****_Purchase Price_**.

 



 

(a) The purchase price payable by Purchaser to Seller for the Interests (the "
_Purchase Price_ ") shall be an amount equal to: (i) One Hundred and Two
Million Dollars

 



      
 

 



 

($102,000,000) (the " _Base Cash Consideration_ "), plus (ii) the amount, if
any, that Closing Date Working Capital exceeds Target Working Capital minus
(iii) the amount, if any, that Target Working Capital exceeds Closing Date
Working Capital.

 



 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
definitions set forth below:

 



 

(i) " _Adjustment Calculation Time_ " means 11:59 p.m. (eastern time) on the
Sunday immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(ii) " _Closing Date Working Capital_ " means the Working Capital of the
Companies as of the Adjustment Calculation Time.

 



 

 **1.3** ** ****_Payment of Purchase Price_**.

 



 

(a) At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller, in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to accounts designated by Seller
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an amount equal to the Base
Cash Consideration less the Escrow Amount.

 



 

(b) In accordance with the provisions of _Section 1.4(f)_, and at the time
set forth therein, Purchaser shall pay to or cause to be paid to Seller or
Seller shall pay to or cause to be paid to Purchaser, as the case may be, in
immediately-available funds by wire transfer to accounts designated by Seller
or Purchaser, as applicable, the amount of the Working Capital Adjustment.

 



 

(c) (i) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing (or, if later, five (5)
days after the final determination of the Closing Date Working Capital
pursuant to _Section 1.4_), Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller a
draft of a statement (the " _Allocation Statement_ ") setting forth its
proposed calculation of the aggregate amount of the Purchase Price (including
the amount of any assumed liabilities) to be allocated between each of the
Companies and the proposed allocation of such aggregate amount among the
assets of each of the Companies. If within thirty (30) days after Sellers
receipt of the draft Allocation Statement, Seller shall not have objected in
writing to such draft Allocation Statement, the draft Allocation Statement
shall become the Allocation Statement and shall be final and binding upon the
parties hereto. In the event that Seller objects in writing within such 30-day
period, Seller and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the
dispute; provided that the only basis on which Seller may object to such
proposed allocation (or any portion thereof) is that the proposed allocation
was not prepared in accordance with _Section 1.3(c)(ii)_. If Seller and
Purchaser are unable to reach an agreement within thirty (30) days after
Purchasers receipt of Sellers written objection, the dispute shall be
resolved and the Allocation Statement shall be determined by an independent,
nationally recognized accounting firm mutually selected by Purchaser and
Seller. The Allocation Statement, as agreed upon by Purchaser and Seller
and/or determined under this _Section 1.3(c)_, shall be final and binding
upon the parties hereto. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall bear all fees and
costs incurred by it in connection with the determination of the Allocation
Statement, except that Purchaser and Seller shall each pay one-half (50%) of
the fees and expenses of the accounting firm.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) The Allocation Statement will be prepared in accordance with Section 1060
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the
rules and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Purchaser and Seller
also shall allocate and report any adjustments to the Purchase Price in
accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.1060-1(e), and any allocations
made as a result of such adjustments shall become part of the Allocation
Statement and shall be made consistent with the Allocation Statement

 **1.4** ** ****_Working Capital Adjustment_**.

 



 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Working Capital_ " shall mean,
as of a particular date, the consolidated working capital of the Companies,
which consolidated working capital shall be computed in accordance with the
accounting methodologies, practices and principles used to prepare the
illustrative calculation set forth in _Schedule 1.4(a)_ attached hereto, and
shall equal: (i) the aggregate amount of the following assets of the
Companies: (A) the Companies notes and accounts receivable (but excluding
accounts receivable from Affiliates), net of reserves (B) the Companies
inventories of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods or products
and, useable or saleable in the ordinary course of Business (the "
_Inventories_ ") and (C) the Companies prepaid timber deposits; _minus_ (ii)
the aggregate amount of the following liabilities of the Companies: (X) the
trade payables of the Companies (but excluding trade payables to Affiliates),
and (Y) other accrued liabilities of the Companies, including accrued payroll
liabilities (but excluding liabilities to Affiliates). Except as otherwise set
forth in _Schedule 1.4(a)_ and except for the forgiveness, consolidation or
closing out of certain intercompany indebtedness, collectables, receivables
and trade payables between the Companies, on the one hand, and the other
subsidiaries of Seller Guarantor, on the other hand, the amounts of all items
to be used in the calculation of Working Capital will be determined in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ "),
consistently applied.

 



 

(b) The parties have heretofore mutually agreed that the target Working
Capital shall be an amount equal to $3,100,000 (the " _Target Working Capital_
").

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to
Seller (the date of such delivery being the " _Adjustment Date_ ") a statement
setting forth the Closing Date Working Capital of the Companies as of the
Adjustment Calculation Time (the " _Closing Statement_ "), which Closing
Statement shall have been prepared in accordance with the accounting
methodologies, practices and principles used to prepare the illustrative
calculation set forth in _Schedule 1.4(a)_ attached hereto. Following
delivery by Purchaser to Seller of the Closing Statement, Purchaser and its
accountants shall promptly permit Seller and its accountants to have
reasonable access to books, records, work papers and calculations related
thereto, and consult with Seller and its accountants as to questions they may
have, in all cases, to the extent reasonably necessary for Seller to review
the Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Date Working Capital.

 



 

(d) Any dispute which may arise between Purchaser and Seller as to the Closing
Statement shall be resolved in the following manner:

 



 

(i) If Seller disputes the calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital,
Seller must notify Purchaser in writing within thirty (30) days after the
Adjustment Date, and shall specify therein in reasonable detail the basis and
reason for such dispute and the amount which is in dispute (the " _Disputed
Amount_ ");

 



 

(ii) During the thirty (30) day period following the date Purchaser receives
such notice of dispute, Purchaser and Seller shall attempt to resolve such
dispute; and

 



 

(iii) If at the end of the thirty (30) day period specified in clause (ii)
above, the parties shall have failed to reach agreement with respect to such
dispute, the matter shall be referred to the Charlotte, North Carolina office
of Ernst and Young LLP or such other nationally or regionally recognized firm of
independent public accountants as Purchaser and Seller mutually agree, who
shall act as an arbitrator (the " _Arbitrator_ "). The Arbitrator shall base
its determination only on written presentations by Purchaser and Seller which
are in accordance with the definitions contained in this Agreement and the
guidelines and principles of this _Section 1.4_ (e.g., not on the basis of an
independent review) and shall render a written report (the " _Adjustment
Report_ ") to Seller and Purchaser setting forth, in reasonable detail, the
Arbitrators determination with respect to each of the disputed items or
amounts submitted to the Arbitrator (and only such amounts), and the
adjustments, if any, to be made to the Closing Statement and the Closing Date
Working Capital, as applicable, together with reasonably detailed supporting
calculations. In resolving any disputed item, the Arbitrator (i) shall adhere
to the definitions contained in this Agreement and the guidelines and
principles of this _Section 1.4_ and (ii) shall not assign a value to any
item higher than the highest value for such item claimed by either party or
lower than the lowest value for such item claimed by either party. The
Arbitrator shall be instructed to use every reasonable effort to perform such
services within thirty (30) days following the submission to it of the Closing
Statement and the information related to the Disputed Amount and, in any case,
as soon as practicable after such submission. Each of Purchaser and Seller
shall bear its respective costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with
such arbitration, and all fees and expenses relating to the work of the
Arbitrator shall be borne by Seller, on the

 



       
 

 



 

one hand, and by Purchaser, on the other hand, in inverse proportion as they
may prevail on the matters resolved by the Arbitrator (such inverse proportion
for each party shall be the absolute value obtained for each party by dividing
(A) the difference of (1) the amount of the Working Capital Adjustment
proposed by such party and (2) the amount of the Working Capital Adjustment
established by the Arbitrator by (B) the difference between (1) the amount of
the Working Capital Adjustment proposed by Seller and (2) the amount of
Working Capital Adjustment proposed by Purchaser), which proportionate
allocation shall also be determined by the Arbitrator and set forth in the
Adjustment Report. This provision for arbitration shall be specifically
enforceable by Purchaser and Seller and, absent manifest error, the decision
of the Arbitrator in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be final and
binding and there shall be no right of appeal therefrom.

 



 

(e) In the event that Seller does not deliver written notice of its objection,
if any, to the Closing Statement within thirty (30) days following the
Adjustment Date, the Closing Date Working Capital as set forth in the Closing
Statement shall be final and binding upon Purchaser and Seller on the first
day following the end of such thirty (30) day period, and the amount of the
Working Capital Adjustment, if any, shall be disbursed in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 1.4(f)_. In the event that Seller delivers written
notice of its objection to the Closing Date Working Capital to Purchaser
within thirty (30) days following the Adjustment Date, the Closing Date
Working Capital, as determined by agreement between Purchaser and Seller or,
if applicable, by the Arbitrator pursuant to _Section 1.4(c)(iii)_, shall be
deemed to be final and binding on Seller and Purchaser on the date Seller and
Purchaser agree, in writing, to the amount of the Closing Date Working Capital
or on the date that the Arbitrator delivers its determination of the amount of
the Closing Date Working Capital to Purchaser and Seller, as applicable, and
upon such final determination of the amount of the Closing Date Working
Capital, the amount of the Working Capital Adjustment, if any, shall be
disbursed in accordance with the terms of _Section 1.4(f)_.

 



 

(f) (i) Within ten (10) days following the date that the amount of the Closing
Date Working Capital becomes final and binding on the parties as provided for
in _Section 1.4(e)_, the Working Capital Adjustment shall be paid as follows:

 



 

(A) Purchaser shall pay to Seller, in immediately-available funds, an amount
equal to the difference (if any, and if a positive result) between (I) the
Closing Date Working Capital, _minus_ (II) the Target Working Capital; or,
alternatively

 



 

(B) Seller shall pay to Purchaser, in immediately-available funds, an amount
equal to the difference (if any, and if a positive result) between (I) the
Target Working Capital _minus_ (II) the Closing Date Working Capital. The
amount, if any, payable as a result of the calculation in paragraph (A) or (B)
is referred to herein as the " _Working Capital Adjustment_."

 



 

(ii) In the event of a dispute made in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 1.4(d)_, (A) notwithstanding such dispute, the parties shall make
any adjusting payment required under _Section 1.4(f)(i)_, to the extent that
the greater of (1) Purchasers calculation of the

 



      
 

 



 

adjusting payment or (2) Sellers calculation of the adjusting payment exceeds
the Disputed Amount, at the time and in the manner set forth in _Section
1.4(f)(i)_ and (B) the balance (being the Disputed Amount or such different
amount compromised and settled by the parties or determined by the accounting
firm in accordance with the provisions of _Section 1.4(d)_), shall be paid in
immediately-available funds within ten (10) days after such settlement or
determination, as the case may be. For Tax purposes, any payment by Purchaser
or Seller pursuant to this _Section 1.4(f)_ shall be treated as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price unless a contrary treatment is required by Law.

 



 

 **1.5** ** ****_Closing_**. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the consummation of the purchase and sale of the Interests and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Andrews Kurth LLP, 600 Travis, Suite 4200, Houston,

such conditions or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived in writing by the
party entitled to waive such conditions), or at such other place, date and
time as shall be agreed upon in writing by Purchaser and Seller (the date that

shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Person an amount not in excess of the amount
they are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the payment of such
consideration under any Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as

withholding was made.

liability, expense, or other damage with respect to Taxes that are (I)
attributable to any transaction outside of the ordinary course of business
entered into by Purchaser or its Affiliates or at the direction of Purchaser
or its Affiliates that occurs on the Closing Date or after the Closing or (II)
attributable to Taxes with respect to any taxable period or portion thereof
beginning after the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to
be timely filed all Tax Returns of each Company for all periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date, regardless of when they are to be filed. Seller
shall timely pay all Taxes (as defined below) to the extent they were not
taken into account in calculating the Closing Date Working Capital
attributable to the Companies with respect to such periods.

 



 

(c) Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed, subject to the review and reasonable comment of Seller with respect to
Tax Returns for a Straddle Period (as defined below), all Tax Returns of each
Company for all taxable periods ending after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall
pay the full amount of any Taxes attributable to each Company for taxable
periods (or portion thereof) beginning after the Adjustment Calculation Time.
Seller shall be responsible for a portion of all Taxes which are attributable
to any taxable period which begins on or before the Closing Date and ends
after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") that were not paid on or
prior to the Adjustment Calculation Time or taken into account in determining
the Closing Date Working Capital and shall, pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_, be
responsible for all Taxes attributable to any Tax period ending on or before
the Closing Date. The portion of any Tax payable with respect to a Straddle
Period will be allocated between the period of the Straddle Period that
extends before the Closing Date through the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing
Straddle Period_ ") and the period of the Straddle Period that extends from
the day after the Closing Date to the end of the Straddle Period (the " _Post-
Closing Straddle Period_ ") in accordance with this _Section 2.7(c)_. The
portion of such Tax allocated to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period will be (i)
in the case of Taxes that are based upon or related to income or gross
receipts sales or use Taxes or employment or payroll Taxes, deemed equal to
the amount that would be payable if the Straddle Period ended on the Closing
Date; and (ii) in the case of any Taxes other than those Taxes based upon or
related to income or gross receipts, sales or use Taxes or employment or
payroll Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the Straddle Period,
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the total number of days in
such Straddle Period from the beginning of such Straddle Period up to and
including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the total number
of days in such Straddle Period. The portion of Tax attributable to a Post-
Closing Straddle Period shall be calculated in a corresponding manner.

 



 

(d) Each party hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide to
each of the other parties hereto such cooperation and information as any of
them reasonably may request in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or
claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to refund of
Taxes or, subject to _Section 2.7(e)_, in conducting any audit or other

 



      
 

 



 

proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall include
providing copies of all relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns, together
with relevant accompanying schedules and work papers, relevant documents
relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing authorities and relevant
records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property, which such party
may possess. Each party shall make its employees reasonably available on a
mutually-convenient basis at its cost to provide explanation of any documents
or information so provided. Subject to the preceding sentence, each party
required to file Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement shall bear all costs
of preparing and filing such Tax Returns. Any Tax Return to be prepared
pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 2.7_ that is with respect to any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or the Pre-Closing
Straddle Period shall be prepared in a manner consistent with practices
followed in prior years with respect to similar Tax Returns, except for
changes required by changes in applicable Law or fact. Except as otherwise set
forth herein, for purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Affiliate_ " or "
_Affiliates_ ," with respect to any Person, shall mean any person controlling,
controlled by, or under common control with such person, and " _control_ "
means, with respect to any person, the ability to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of such person, whether through the
ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise.

 



 

(e) Each party hereto shall, on receiving a notice of audit of either Company,
from any federal, state, local, or foreign government or any agency or
political subdivision of any such government, notify the other party if such
audit is with respect to taxable years or periods up to and including the
Closing Date. Should the audit be with respect to years or periods up to and
including the Closing Date, Seller shall have the right to participate in any
such audit at its expense; provided, however, Purchaser shall control such
audit.

 



 

(f) Any refunds of Taxes attributable to a Taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending on or prior to the Closing Date shall be attributed to Sellers
account, and Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, any such refunds to
Seller within ten (10) days of receipt thereof net of any Tax incurred upon
receipt of such refunds, costs incurred in acquiring such refunds, any
withholding Taxes due, and any amounts included in determining the final
Purchase Price. If there is a subsequent reduction of any such refund of Tax
by a Governmental Authority (or by virtue of a change in applicable Tax law),
then the Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to such reduction.

 



 

(g) No amended Tax Return with respect to a Taxable period beginning prior to
the Closing Date shall be filed by or on behalf of either Company without the
consent of Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

 



 

(h) All sales, use and transfer taxes, bulk transfer taxes, deed taxes,
conveyance fees, documentary and recording charges and similar taxes imposed
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, together with
any interest, penalties or additions to such transfer taxes or attributable to
any failure to comply with any requirement regarding Tax Returns (" _Transfer
Taxes_ ") shall be borne 50% by Purchaser and 50% by Seller.

 



 

(i) All tax-sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or
involving either Company shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after
the Closing Date, neither Company shall not be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder.

 



       
 

 

 ** **

 

 **2.8** ** ****_Access_**. The Purchaser hereby agrees that, for a period of
six (6) years after the Closing, Seller or its representatives shall have
reasonable access to records of each Company which are necessary for Sellers
or its members compliance with Tax Law or other legitimate business purposes
(including, without limitation, in connection with litigation upon reasonable
prior notice at reasonable times during regular business hours). Such access
shall include an opportunity to make photocopies of such records (at the
requesting partys expense). Seller and its representatives shall maintain the
confidentiality of the contents of such records.

 



 

 **2.9** ** ****_Employee Benefits Continuation_**. For a period of not less
than one (1) year from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall (or shall
cause each Company to) provide to such Companys existing employees
(hereafter, the " _Continuing Employees_ "), while they are employed by such
Company, with employee benefits (including severance benefits) and base
compensation and bonus opportunities (other than retention arrangements that
are not set forth on _Schedule 3.12(v)_ and equity incentive arrangements but
including the quarterly cash incentive plans disclosed on _Schedule 3.3_ )
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided by such Company
immediately prior to the Closing Date, including the quarterly cash incentive
plan of each Company; provided that (x) each Company shall be obligated to pay
to the Continuing Employees all bonus payments that have been accrued by the
applicable Company on the Closing Statement and (y) Purchaser shall cause the
Companies to maintain each Companys existing group medical plan through and
including December 31, 2013. Nothing contained herein, express or implied: (i)
shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, (ii) except as expressly provided above with respect
to the Companies existing group medical plans and for any Contract disclosed
on _Schedule 3.12(v)_ , shall alter or limit Purchasers, any Companys or any
of their affiliates ability to amend, modify or terminate any particular
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (iii) is intended to confer
upon any current or former employee any right to employment or continued
employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to
a particular term or condition of employment, or (iv) is intended to confer
upon any individual (including employees, retirees, or dependents or
beneficiaries of employees or retirees) any right as a third-party beneficiary
of this Agreement.

 



 

 **2.10** ** ****_Insurance Matters_**. Without in any way limiting or
amending any other rights that Purchaser or any other Purchaser Indemnitees
may have under this Agreement or in any other Transaction Document ( _e.g._ ,
because the matter giving rise to such claim is a matter for which the
Purchaser Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification in accordance with this
Agreement) with respect to the matter giving rise to such claim, to the extent
included in the calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital or with
respect to unknown third party claims of the Company or unknown amounts with
respect to known and accrued for claims, the Companies shall continue to be
responsible for any and all liabilities, obligations, costs, fees, expenses,
fines or third-party claims of the Companies under any insurance policy
maintained by Seller that may provide coverage for claims relating in any way
to the Companies prior to the Closing (" _Seller Policies_ "). With respect to
the general liability policies and umbrella liability policies maintained by
Seller or its parent for the benefit of the Companies, Seller agrees to
cooperate and assist Purchaser in tendering appropriate claims against such
policies with respect to matters that occur prior to the Adjustment
Calculation Time. To the extent requested by Purchaser, at Closing, Seller
shall assign to Purchaser such (i) property and equipment breakdown insurance
policies and (ii) workers compensation policies maintained by Seller or its
parent on behalf of

 



      
 

 



 

the Companies (as they apply to the Companies) subject to any requirements
imposed by the insurers.

 



 

 **2.11** ** ****_Escrow_**. At Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to Wells
Fargo, N.A. (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") an amount equal to Five Million One
Hundred Thousand and No/100ths Dollars ($5,100,000) (the " _Escrow Amount_ ",
and together with any interest or other earnings thereon, collectively, the "
_Escrow Funds_ ") by certified or bank cashiers check or wire transfer, which
Escrow Funds shall be held back from the Purchase Price for a period of two
(2) years following the Closing pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement
to be entered into as of the Closing Date (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") in a
form to be agreed upon between Purchaser and Seller. The Escrow Funds shall be
governed by and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and may
be drawn upon by Purchaser in payment of any Losses incurred by Purchaser or
the Company arising out of, based upon, relating to, or in connection with (i)
any Working Capital Adjustment payable to Purchaser pursuant to _Section
1.4(f)_, above (to the extent such amounts have not been paid by Seller within
the ten-day period set forth in _Section 1.4(f)_), or (ii) claims for
indemnification under _Section 9.1_, in each case subject to the procedures
and limitations set forth herein or in the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent
shall deliver to Seller the amount of remaining Escrow Funds held in escrow on
the date which is two (2) years from the Closing Date except to the extent,
prior to said date, Purchaser provides to Escrow Agent and Seller a written
statement executed by Purchaser setting forth any pending or threatened claims
or other matters in the categories provided in parts (i)-(ii) of this _Section
2.11_. Purchaser and Seller shall each be responsible for fifty percent (50%)
of all costs and expenses of the Escrow Agent. Seller shall remain in
existence and in good standing so long as the Escrow Agreement remains in
effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, within five (5) business days after
request by Seller, but in no event before the first anniversary of the Escrow
Agreement, Seller may instruct the Escrow Agent to release to Seller an amount
(if greater than zero) equal to (i) $2,550,000 _minus_ (ii) the aggregate
amount of any outstanding and unresolved claims received by the Escrow Agent
on or prior to the first anniversary of Closing _minus_ the aggregate amount
released from the Escrow Account to Purchaser Indemnitees prior to the first
anniversary of Closing. All parties hereto agree for all Tax purposes that:
(i) Purchaser shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow Funds, or any
portion thereof, shall be allocable to Purchaser pursuant to Section 468B(g)
of the Code and Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.468B-8, (ii) if and to
the extent any amount of the Escrow Funds is actually distributed to Seller,
interest may be imputed on such amount, as required by Section 483 or 1274 of
the Code, (iii) Sellers right to the Escrow Funds under this Agreement shall
be treated as installment obligations for purposes of Section 453 of the Code,
and (iv) in no event shall the aggregate payments under the Escrow Funds to
Seller exceed $5,800,000. Clause (iv) of the preceding sentence is intended to
ensure that the right of Seller to the Escrow Funds is not treated as a
contingent payment without a stated maximum selling price under Section 453 of
the Code and the Treasury Regulation promulgated thereunder. No party hereto
shall take any action or filing position for Tax purposes inconsistent with
the foregoing.

or assets.

 



 

 **3.** ** ****_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER REGARDING THE
COMPANIES_**. To induce Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and to purchase
the Interests, Seller hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows:

 



 

 **3.1** ** ****_Disclosure Schedules_**. Attached hereto are the Disclosure
Schedules of Seller containing certain information regarding Seller, the
Companies and the Business as specified in various provisions in this
Agreement. Information contained in the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed
to be part of and qualify the representations and warranties of Seller
contained in this _Article 3_ to the extent that that the applicability of
such information to a particular representation or warranty is reasonably
apparent from the face of the disclosure thereof. Unless otherwise indicated,
all capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules shall have the meanings
set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

 **3.2** ** ****_Organization and Compliance_**.

 



 

(a) Each Company is a limited liability company duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with
its principal office and places of business at the location specified in
_Schedule 3.2(a)_. Neither Company has any interest, direct or indirect, nor
does either Company control, directly or indirectly, or have any equity
participation, directly or indirectly, or have any commitment or right to
purchase or otherwise acquire any interest, direct or indirect, or obligation
to provide funds to or make any investment in any other corporation, limited
liability company, partnership, joint venture or other business enterprise.
Each Company has all requisite limited liability company power and authority
and is entitled to own or lease its respective properties and carry on the
Business (as presently conducted) as and in all places where such Business is
now conducted and such properties are validly owned or leased.

 



 

(b) Each Company is duly licensed, in good standing and qualified or
domesticated as a foreign limited liability company in the jurisdictions
listed in _Schedule 3.2(b)_ ,

 



      
 

 



 

which are the only jurisdictions where the character of the property owned by
it or the nature of the Business as conducted by it makes such license,
qualification or domestication necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed, in good standing and qualified or domesticated would not reasonably
be expected to result, either individually or in the aggregate, in a Material
Adverse Effect. True, correct and complete copies of the organizational
documents of each Company have been previously made available to Purchaser.

 



 

(c) As used in this Agreement, " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means a material
adverse effect on (x) the Companies assets, liabilities, business,
operations, financial condition or results of operations of the Business,
taken as a whole or (y) the ability of Seller to enter into this Agreement or
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that
the following shall not be considered when determining whether a Material
Adverse Effect has occurred: any effect resulting from (a) any change in
economic or regulatory conditions that generally affect the industry or
segment in which each Company operates (including changes in the lumber or
plywood business), the wholesale or retail markets for fuel supply, markets
for other supplies and commodities, the transportation systems, interest
rates, or consumer confidence); (b) any change in general social or political
conditions, including acts of war or terrorist activities, (c) any change in
any Laws (including Environmental Laws), (d) any effects of weather or
meteorological events, (e) any events, circumstances, changes or effects
affecting the securities markets generally, (f) any change in the financial
condition or results of operation of either Company resulting from the
announcement of the transactions contemplated hereby, (g) compliance with the
terms of this Agreement and (h) any actions to be taken pursuant to or in
accordance with this Agreement; provided, further, that in the case of the
foregoing clauses (a) and (e) such matter shall be taken into account to the

a whole) relative to other businesses in the industries in which the Companies
operate.

 



 

 **3.3** ** ****_Capitalization of each Company_**.

 



 

(a) The Interests are the only limited liability company membership or other
equity interests of either Company that are authorized, issued or outstanding
as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date. Except for liens to be
released at Closing, the respective Interests are validly issued and
outstanding and are owned beneficially and of record by Seller free and clear
of any mortgage, security interest, collateral assignment, pledge, lien,
charge, claim, lease, conditional sale or other title retention agreement,
easement, limitation, commitment, encroachment, restriction or other
encumbrance (each an " _Encumbrance_ " and collectively, the " _Encumbrances_
"). No limited liability company membership or other equity interests of
either Company are reserved for issuance and there are no issued and
outstanding contracts, demands, commitments, options, warrants, rights of
first refusal, offers, subscriptions, preemptive rights, claims of any
character or other agreements or understandings to which either Company is
bound relating to the limited liability company membership or other equity
interests of such Company (including, without limitation, the applicable
Interests) or pursuant to which such Company is or may become obligated to
sell, transfer, encumber, assign, issue or exchange any limited liability
company membership or other equity interests in such Company or by which any
Person or entity has any right to acquire an interest in any limited liability
company membership or other equity interests of such Company. Except as

Agreement_ "), Chesters Limited Liability Company Agreement (as amended, the
" _Chester LLC Agreement_ " and together with the Moncure LLC Agreement,

Interests or other limited liability company membership or other equity
interests of such Company are subject to, and Seller is not a party to, any
voting trust, proxy or other contract, agreement, arrangement, commitment or
understanding relating thereto.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.3_ , there are no unit appreciation,
phantom unit, profit participation or similar right with respect to either
Company.

Company is or will be a party and all transactions required hereunder or

affecting the rights of creditors generally.

Consents (as hereinafter defined in _Section 3.6_) or as otherwise disclosed

the other Transaction Documents to which each Company is or will be a party,
nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein or therein will
(with or without notice or consent or the passage of time or all): (a)
contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any Law,
Permit or applicable judgment, decision, consent decree, injunction, ruling,
writ or order of or entered by any Governmental Authority that is binding on
either Company or their respective properties; or (b) contravene, conflict
with or result in a violation or breach of, or constitute a default under or

payments), or result in the creation of any Encumbrance upon the assets of
either Company, under any term or provision of: (i) the Certificates of
Formation or Company LLC Agreements, (ii) any Contract of either Company, or
(iii) any other commitment or restriction, in each case to which either

other instrument, contract, agreement or commitment to which either Company is
a party or by which any of such Companys assets is subject or bound except

have been received by Seller or either Company alleging failure to hold any of
the foregoing. All Permits are set forth on _Schedule 3.7_ (except for Permits

foreign company in all jurisdictions where the character of the property owned
by it or the nature of the business transacted by it makes such license,

materially impair the ability of Purchaser to consummate the transactions

is a party or to fulfill its obligations hereunder and thereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

 **5.2** ** ****_Authorization; No Inconsistent Agreements_**. Purchaser has

contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement, the other Transaction

officers, and this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it
is a party constitute the valid and legally binding obligation of Purchaser
enforceable against Purchaser, subject to general equity principles, each in

bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the other Transaction Documents to which it is or will be a party, nor the
consummation of the transactions hereby or thereby contemplated, will
constitute a violation or breach of (i) the certificate of formation of
Purchaser (or similar governing document), (ii) any provision of any contract
or other instrument to which Purchaser is a party or by which any of the
assets of Purchaser may be affected or secured, or (iii) any order, writ,
injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation to which Purchaser is subject,
except any violation or breach under clauses (ii) or (iii) that would not
reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of Purchaser to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which it is or will be a party or to fulfill its
obligations hereunder and thereunder. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.2_ or
the requirements of the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws, the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by Purchaser and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement do not require the consent,
approval or action of, or any filing with or notice to any Governmental
Authority or other third party by Purchaser, except where the failure to
obtain such consent, approval or action or make such filing or notice would
not reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of Purchaser to

Transaction Documents to which it is a party or to fulfill its obligations
hereunder and thereunder.

its representatives have incurred no obligation or liability, contingent or
otherwise, for brokerage or finders fees or agents commissions or other
similar payment in connection with this Agreement.

for the account of Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a view
to, or for offer or resale in connection with, a distribution of all or any
part thereof. Purchaser has such knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an
investment in the Interests. Purchaser has not made any commitment to sell,
transfer or assign, and has no presently arranged plan or intention to sell,
transfer or assign, any of the Interests. Purchaser acknowledges that the
Interests are not registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, or any state securities laws.

Agreement through such representation and warranties (in each case without
giving effect to Material Adverse Effect qualification in the representations
and warranties) except (a) with respect to any such representations and
warranties that speak as to an earlier date, which representations and
warranties shall be true and correct at and as of such earlier date or (b) to

subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.4_ and not in duplication
of any indemnity obligation of Seller pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_, Seller
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including, from and after the Closing, the Companies), and their respective
equityholders, officers, directors, employees, members, managers, partners,
stockholders, agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns
(hereafter, collectively, " _Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") from and against and in
respect of any and all Losses suffered, sustained or incurred by any Purchaser
Indemnitee by reason of, that relate to or arising out of:

 



 

(a) any failure of the representations and warranties by Seller contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate, instrument or document delivered
hereunder to be true and correct in all respects as of the date hereof and as
of the Closing Date;

 



 

(b) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement of Seller
contained in this Agreement or contained in any certificate, instrument or
document delivered hereunder; or

 



 

(c) the operations of any present or past business conducted, directly or
indirectly by Seller or Seller Guarantor or any if its Subsidiaries, other
than the Business as conducted by the Companies.

 



 

For purposes of (x) determining whether there has been a failure of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Seller to be true and
correct and (y) calculating the amount of Losses with respect thereto, all
limitations or qualifications based on materiality, Material Adverse Effect,
knowledge or other terms of similar import or effect shall be disregarded.

 



 

 **9.2 _Indemnification of Seller_**. From and after Closing, subject to the
limitations set forth in _Section 9.4_, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates, and their respective equityholders,
officers, directors, employees, members, managers, partners, stockholders,

collectively, " _Seller s Indemnitees_") from and against and in respect of
any and all Losses suffered, sustained or incurred by any Sellers Indemnitee
by reason of, that relate to or arising out of:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) any failure of the representations and warranties by Purchaser contained
in this Agreement or in any certificate, instrument or document delivered
hereunder to be true and correct in all respects as of the date hereof and as
of the Closing Date; or

 



 

(b) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser
contained in this Agreement or contained in any certificate, instrument or
document delivered hereunder.

 



 

For the purposes of this Agreement the term " _Losses_ " shall mean any and
all costs, losses, damages, Tax deficiencies, liabilities, obligations and
other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including without limitation
interest, deductibles paid, Taxes, fines, penalties, reasonable attorneys
fees and all amounts paid in the investigation, defense or settlement of any
action, claim, demand, cause of action, choses in action, right of recovery or
right of set-off of whatever kind or description against any Person, suit,
litigation, proceeding or investigation actions related thereto.

 



 

 **9.3 _Defense of Claims_**. If any claim or action by a third party (a "
_Third Party Claim_ ") arises after the Closing Date and during the Survival
Period for which (i) Seller may be liable to any Purchaser Indemnitee or (ii)
Purchaser may be liable to any Sellers Indemnitee (for purposes of this
_Section 9.3_, Purchaser Indemnitees and Sellers Indemnitees are sometimes
referred to as " _Indemnitee(s)_ " and, Seller and Purchaser are sometimes
referred to as " _Indemnitor(s)_ ", in each case, as the context requires),
then in such event the affected Indemnitee(s) shall notify their Indemnitor(s)
in writing within a reasonable time after such Third Party Claim arises and is
known to such Indemnitee(s); provided that the Indemnitor(s) will be relieved
of its indemnification obligations hereunder solely to the extent that it is
actually and materially prejudiced by the Indemnitees failure to provide such
notice within a reasonable time after such Third Party Claim becomes known to
Indemnitee(s). If Indemnitor(s) wish to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim, then Indemnitor(s) shall give written notice to Indemnitee(s) within
twenty (20) days after notice from Indemnitee(s) of such Third Party Claim
(unless the Third Party Claim reasonably requires a response in less than
twenty (20) days after the notice is given to the Indemnitor(s), in which
event they shall notify Indemnitee(s) at least five (5) days prior to such
reasonably required response date), which notice shall constitute an
acknowledgement by Indemnitor(s) that it shall provide indemnification to
Indemnitee(s) for such Third Party Claim, and Indemnitor(s) shall thereafter
assume the defense of any such Third Party Claim, through counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Indemnitee(s); provided that Indemnitee(s) may participate in
such defense at their own expense; and provided further that Indemnitor(s)
shall not in any event have the right to control the defense of the Third
Party Claim if: (I) Indemnitor fails to provide reasonable assurance to the
Indemnitee of its intent and ability to defend such claim or proceeding,
including Indemnitors financial capacity to defend such claim (including the
right of Indemnitor to call upon its members or equityholders pursuant to any
guaranty or similar agreement); (II) the relief requested includes any
injunctive or other equitable relief; (III) such claim involves any criminal
action to which the Indemnitee is a party or is with respect to Taxes; or (IV)
involves a claim that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect
on the Indemnitees reputation, relations with one or more customer or
supplier or future business prospects.

 



      
 

 



 

(a) If Indemnitor(s) do not or are not permitted to assume the defense of, or
if after so assuming Indemnitor(s) fail to diligently defend any Third Party
Claim, then Indemnitee(s) may defend against such Third Party Claim in such
manner as they may deem appropriate (provided that Indemnitor(s) may
participate in such defense at their own expense) and Indemnitee(s) may settle
such Third Party Claim on such terms as they may deem reasonably appropriate,
and Indemnitor(s) shall promptly reimburse Indemnitee(s) for the amount of all
Losses reasonably incurred by Indemnitee(s) in connection with the defense
against and settlement of such Third Party Claim. If no settlement of such
Third Party Claim is made, Indemnitor(s) shall satisfy any judgment rendered
with respect to such Third Party Claim, before Indemnitee(s) are required to
do so, and pay all expenses, legal or otherwise, reasonably incurred by
Indemnitee(s) in the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 



 

(b) If a judgment is rendered against any of the Indemnitees in any action
covered by the indemnification hereunder, or any lien in respect of such
judgment attaches to any of the assets of any of the Indemnitees, then
Indemnitor(s) shall promptly upon such entry or attachment pay such judgment
in full or discharge such lien, at the expense and direction of Indemnitor(s)
as and when due, unless an appeal is taken under which the execution of the
judgment or satisfaction of the lien is stayed (and the Indemnitor(s) shall be
responsible for any bond required in connection therewith). If and when a
final judgment is rendered in any such action, Indemnitor(s) shall forthwith
pay such judgment or discharge such lien before any Indemnitee is compelled to
do so.

 



 

 **9.4 _Limitations of Indemnification_**. The indemnification of Purchaser
Indemnitees by Seller under _Section 9.1_ hereof shall be further limited as
follows:

 



 

(a) (i) Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to any payment under the
indemnification provisions set forth in _Section 9.1(a)_ unless and to the
extent the total aggregate claims of Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to such
indemnification provisions exceed an amount equal to One Percent (1%) of the
Base Cash Consideration in the aggregate (the " _Deductible_ ") (at which time
Purchaser Indemnitees shall only be entitled to claim all Losses in excess of
the Deductible up to the Cap); provided that the Deductible shall not apply
to, and Purchaser shall be fully compensated for, any breach of _Sections 3.2_
, _3.3_ , _3.4_ , _3.8_ , _3.11(a)_ , _3.14_ , _3.19_ , _3.23_ , _4.1_ , _4.2_
and _4.3_ (collectively, the " _Specified Representations_ "); and (ii)
Sellers aggregate liability to Purchaser Indemnitees under the
indemnification provided under _Section 9.1(a)_ hereof or otherwise shall in
no event exceed, collectively, an amount equal to Seven and One-Half Percent
(7.5%) of the Base Consideration (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Cap shall not apply to any breach of the Specified Representations
or, for the avoidance of doubt, the matters subject to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_. In no event shall Sellers aggregate liability
to Purchaser Indemnitees with respect to any breach of the Specified
Representations exceed the Base Cash Consideration.

 



 

(b) Except as paid to a third party, any liability or undertaking of Seller to
indemnify Purchaser pursuant to _Section 9.1_ shall also be subject to the
following additional limitations: (I) no Losses shall be deemed to have been
sustained by Purchaser to the extent of any proceeds actually recovered by
Purchaser or either Company from (x) any third party with respect thereto or
(y) insurance policies with respect thereto, net of the amount of any required
deductible or co-pay, policy premium increase or other expense attributable to
such insurance

 



       
 

 



 

claim, and (II) no Purchaser Indemnitees shall be entitled to recovery to the
extent that the Real Property is used from and after the Closing Date in a
manner that is not substantially similar to its current industrial use.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit Purchasers common law duty to
mitigate.

 



 

(c) IN NO EVENT SHALL A PARTY BE LIABLE HEREUNDER FOR SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OWED OR PAID TO A THIRD PARTY).

 



 

 **9.5 _Exclusive Remedy_**. The sole recourse and exclusive remedy of the
parties hereto after the Closing for the breach of any representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits to this Agreement shall be to assert a claim
for indemnification under the indemnification provisions of this _Article 9_.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no other legal action based
upon predecessor or successor liability, contribution, tort or strict
liability or any statute, regulation or ordinance may be maintained by any
party hereto against any other party hereto or its respective Indemnitees with
respect to any matter that is the subject of this _Article 9_ or otherwise
relates to either Company, its respective assets, the Interests or the
Business. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of
this _Section 9.5_ will not prevent or limit a cause of action (a) under
_Section 1.4_ to enforce any decision or determination of the Arbitrator, (b)
for injunctive or equitable relief or (c) arising out of intentional
misrepresentation or fraud. After the Closing, each party hereto shall take
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming
aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Losses, provided, however, that costs and expenses of such mitigation shall be
deemed to be Losses to the extent arising out of such event.

 



 

 **9.6 _Waiver of Other Representations_**.

 



 

(a) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, THE PARTIES
HEREBY AGREE, THAT NEITHER SELLER NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES
HAS MADE OR IS MAKING ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, WRITTEN OR ORAL, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS
TO THE CONDITION, MERCHANTABILITY, USAGE, SUITABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY
PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE INTERESTS, THE COMPANIES, THE BUSINESS
OR ANY OF THE RELATED ASSETS, OR ANY PART THEREOF, EXCEPT THOSE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN _ARTICLES 3_ AND _4_ OR THE
DOCUMENTS OR INSTRUMENTS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. IN PARTICULAR, AND
WITHOUT IN ANY WAY LIMITING THE FOREGOING, (I) SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATION
OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO ANY FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS OR FORECASTS OR
POLITICAL CONDITIONS RELATING TO THE COMPANIES, THE BUSINESS OR THE RELATED
ASSETS.

 



 

(b) EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES IN _ARTICLES 3_ AND _4_ OR THE DOCUMENTS OR INSTRUMENTS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, THE

 



      
 

 



 

INTERESTS, THE COMPANIES, THE BUSINESS AND THE RELATED ASSETS ARE BEING
TRANSFERRED "AS IS, WHERE IS, WITH ALL FAULTS," AND SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS
ON BEHALF OF ITSELF, ITS AFFILIATES AND REPRESENTATIVES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE CONDITION,
VALUE OR QUALITY OF THE COMPANIES, THE BUSINESS OR ANY RELATED ASSETS OR THE
PROSPECTS (FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE), RISKS AND OTHER INCIDENTS OF THE
COMPANIES, THE BUSINESS OR ANY RELATED ASSETS OR ANY PART THEREOF.

 



 

(c) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, NOTHING IN THIS
PARAGRAPH OR ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL LIMIT OR OTHERWISE AFFECT ANY
RIGHTS OR REMEDIES OF THE PURCHASER INDEMNITEES IN THE EVENT OF ANY FRAUD OR
INTENTIONAL MISREPRESENTATION.

 



 

 **9.7 _Indirect Claims_**. From and after the Closing, Purchaser and the
Companies agree to release Seller and the officers and managers of the
Companies (acting in their capacity as such) from and against any Losses, and
shall not make or bring any claim, demand or legal action for, controlling
stockholder liability or breach of any fiduciary or other duty relating to any
pre Closing actions or failures to act (including negligence or gross
negligence) in connection with the Business or the Companies prior to the
Closing; provided, however, that this _Section 9.7_ shall not prevent
Purchaser from bringing a claim against Seller Guarantor otherwise permitted
by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

 **9.8 _Non-Exacerbation_**. Without limitation of the foregoing, the
Purchaser shall not (i) undertake any remedial action of soil or groundwater
at any Real Property for which it seeks indemnification hereunder unless
required by or required to attain compliance with applicable Environmental
Laws, required by a Governmental Authority with proper jurisdiction over the
matter, reasonable to respond to a Third Party Claim, required to comply with
the terms of a Lease, or to reasonably address a significant or substantial
threat to human health; (ii) importune or incite any Governmental Authority or
other third party to require, request or undertake any such remedial action at
a Real Property (with the understanding that operations in the ordinary course
of business and actions required by Environmental Laws shall not be deemed to
be a breach of this provision); or (iii) conform in any such remedial action
to remedial standards materially more stringent than those least stringent
applicable standards required under applicable Environmental Laws (unless
required to do so by a Governmental Authority or the owner of any Leased Real
Property or as reasonable to respond to a Third Party Claim) as applicable to
the same or similar industrial or commercial use of the Real Property as
conducted by the applicable Company as of the Closing Date. A Purchaser
Indemnitee shall not be entitled to indemnification hereunder for any
Purchasers Indemnified Losses to the extent incurred in connection with any
remedial actions which are of the type referred to in clauses (i)-(iii) above,
or that are otherwise inconsistent with any applicable restrictive covenants
existing prior to the Closing Date at a Real Property under Environmental Law
including, but not limited to, pursuant to the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. § 6901 et seq. (1976) (" _RCRA_ ").

 



 

 **9.9 _Effect of Investigation_**. The right to indemnification, payment of
Losses or for other remedies based on any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained in

 



      
 

 



 

or made pursuant to this Agreement will not be affected by (i) any
investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable
of being acquired) at any time (including as may have resulted based on access
rights hereunder), with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance
with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or (ii) the
waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or
warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or
agreement, and will not affect the right to indemnification based on such
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements.

 



 

 **10. _SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND OTHER PROVISIONS._**

 



 

 **10.1 _Survival_**. If the Closing occurs, the representations and
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive
the Closing for the periods set forth in this _Section 10.1_. All of the
representations and warranties of Seller and Purchaser contained in this
Agreement and all claims and causes of action for the breach thereof shall
terminate on the date that is one (1) year after the Closing Date, except that

Date and (ii) the representations and warranties in _Section 3.17_ shall
terminate on the date that is two (2) years after the Closing Date. The
foregoing time periods (as applicable, the " _Survival Period_ ") shall be
extended automatically to include any time period necessary to resolve a
specific claim for indemnification which was made before expiration of the
applicable Survival Period but not resolved prior to its expiration, including
any claim made under the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
such extension shall apply only as to claims asserted and not so resolved
within the Survival Period. All covenants and agreements of the parties in
this Agreement shall continue until fully performed.

 



 

 **11. _TERMINATION._**

 



 

 **11.1 _Termination for Certain Causes_**. This Agreement may be terminated
at any time prior to or on the Closing by Seller, or by Purchaser, as the case
may be, upon written notice to the other parties only as follows:

 



 

(a) By Seller or Purchaser, on or after September 30, 2013 (the " _End Date_
"), except to the extent failure to close results from the willful and
material failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement;

 



 

(b) By Seller if any of the conditions set forth in _Article 8_ shall have
become incapable of fulfillment on or before the End Date, and shall not have
been waived by Seller (unless Seller has materially breached this Agreement so
as to cause any condition in _Article_ 7 not to have been satisfied);

 



 

(c) By Purchaser if any of the conditions set forth in _Article 7_ shall have
become incapable of fulfillment on or before the End Date, and shall not have
been waived by Purchaser (unless Purchaser has materially breached this
Agreement so as to cause any condition in _Article_ 8 not to have been
satisfied); or

 



 

(d) By mutual agreement of Purchaser, Seller and the Companies.

 



      
 

 



 

 **11.2 _Effect of Termination_**. In order to elect to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1_, written notice of such election must be
given by the terminating party to the other party and, except as otherwise
provided in _Section 11.1_, upon receipt of such notice by the non-
terminating parties, this Agreement shall terminate and have no further
effect, and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned without
any further action by any of the parties, except that the provisions of
_Sections 2.2_ , _2.4_ , _2.5_ , _2.6_ , this _Section 11.2_, _12.1_ , _12.6_
and _12.13_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such termination shall relieve any other party of
liability for breach of this Agreement arising prior to termination.

agreements, instruments, certificates and documents executed and delivered in
connection herewith, including the Transition Services Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement (collectively, the " _Transaction
Documents_ ") supersedes all prior discussions, undertakings and agreements,
whether oral or written, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof, and this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents contain the
sole and entire agreement among the parties with respect to the matters
covered hereby or thereby. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements made herein, together with the indemnification provisions herein,
are intended among other things to allocate the economic cost and the risks
inherent in the transactions contemplated hereby between the parties hereto.
Accordingly, the parties hereto shall be deemed to have relied upon such
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements as a material part to
agreeing to the terms of this Agreement, and the parties and the other
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to the indemnification or other remedies
provided in this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, but no other
Person (other than the parties hereto and the other Indemnified Parties) may
rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth

 **12.5 _Assignment; Binding Effect_**. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, by operation of
law or otherwise, by any party without the prior express written consent of
the other parties and any attempted assignment without such consent shall be
deemed null and void ab initio; provided that Purchaser may freely assign its
rights under this Agreement (in whole or in part) to (i) one or more
Affiliates of Purchaser, (ii) any purchaser of all or substantially all of the
assets of Purchaser or (iii) to any lender of Purchaser as collateral security
for borrowing, at any time whether prior to or following the Closing Date, in
each such case Purchaser will nonetheless remain liable for all

 



      
 

 



 

of its obligations hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that if this Agreement
or any rights hereunder are assigned by Purchaser to any person other than an
Affiliate of Purchaser with the consent of Seller, then Sellers
indemnification obligations hereunder shall terminate on the first to occur of
(i) the effective date of such assignment or (ii) the expiration or
termination of the Survival Period for such indemnification obligations set
forth in _Section 10.1_, above; and provided further that to the extent
performance or payment is made by an Affiliate or Affiliates with respect to
an obligation of Purchaser hereunder, such obligation shall be in full
satisfaction of such obligation of Purchaser hereunder. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

 **12.6 _Governing Law_**. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without
regard to conflict of law principles or rules that would result in the
application of any Law other than the Law of the State of Delaware.

 



 

 **12.7 _Partial Invalidity and Severability_**. All rights and restrictions
contained herein may be exercised and shall be applicable and binding only to
the extent that they do not violate any applicable Laws and are intended to be
limited to the extent necessary to render this Agreement legal, valid and
enforceable. If any term or other provision (or portions thereof) of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions (or any remaining
portions thereof) of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force
and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated
as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

 **12.8 _Waiver_**. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at
any time by the party which is entitled to the benefit thereof, but only if
such waiver is evidenced by a writing signed by such party. No failure on the
part of any party hereto to exercise, and no delay in exercising any right,
power or remedy created hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy by any such
party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or remedy. No waiver by any party hereto to any breach of
or default in any term or condition of this Agreement shall constitute a
waiver of or assent to any succeeding breach of or default in the same or any
other term or condition hereof.

 



 

 **12.9 _Headings; Interpretation_**. The headings of particular provisions of
this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be construed as
a part of this Agreement or serve as a limitation or expansion on the scope of
any term or provision of this Agreement. All references in this Agreement to
