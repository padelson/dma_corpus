For purposes of such deposit, WebMD shall assume that there will not be any fractional shares of WebMD Class A Common Stock.

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. HLTH shall prepare and mail along with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to each holder of record of HLTH Common Stock as of the record date for the HLTH Stockholders Meeting: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such shares (together with any book-entry shares, the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal, including instructions for use in effecting surrender of Certificates (or attaching affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated shares represented by book-entry. In addition, HLTH shall use its best efforts to make the letter of transmittal available to all Persons who become holders of HLTH Common Stock during the period between such record date and the date of the HLTH Stockholders Meeting. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration in the form of (i) a check in the amount equal to the cash, if any, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article III (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of WebMD Class A Common Stock), (ii) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of WebMD Class A Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the shares of HLTH Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate (after taking into account all shares of HLTH Common Stock then held by such holder) and (iii) Merger Notes, if any, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.02, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.03, each Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon surrender the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement with respect to the shares of HLTH Common Stock formerly represented thereby. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of HLTH Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer or stock records of HLTH, any cash to be paid upon, or shares of WebMD Class A Common Stock or Merger Notes to be issued upon, due surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such shares of HLTH Common Stock may be paid or issued, as the case may be, to the transferee if such Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. 

  

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of WebMD Class A Common Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to WebMD Class A Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate the right of receipt of which is represented thereby, until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of escheat, tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares of WebMD Class A Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional share of WebMD Class A Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article III and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of WebMD Class A Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of WebMD Class A Common Stock.

 (d) _Payments with Respect to Unexchanged Merger Notes_. No payments of principal or interest, if any, made after the Effective Time with respect to the Merger Notes shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate the right of receipt of which is represented thereby, until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of escheat, tax or other applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of Merger Notes issued in exchange therefor, without interest, the amount of principal and interest payable with respect to such Merger Notes following the Effective Time (or, with respect to the Convertible Notes, following the conversion of such notes) and prior to the date of surrender. 

  

 (e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of WebMD Class A Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof the right to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of WebMD. Each holder of a fractional share interest shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) such fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all fractional share interests then held by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the Reference Price. As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify WebMD, and WebMD shall deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional share interests subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Article III. 

  

 (f) _No Further Ownership Rights_. The Merger Consideration issued (and paid) in accordance with the terms of this Article III upon conversion of any shares of HLTH Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of HLTH Common Stock subject, however, to WebMDs obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by HLTH on such shares of HLTH Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

 (h) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the holders of the shares of HLTH Common Stock for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to WebMD, upon demand, and any holders of the shares of HLTH Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to WebMD for the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions with respect to WebMD Class A Common Stock and any payments of principal and interest on the Merger Notes to which they 

   ##### 

  

 

are entitled pursuant to this Article III. Any portion of the Exchange Fund

remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of HLTH Common Stock as of a date
which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise

extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of WebMD free and

 (j) _Withholding Rights_. WebMD shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of HLTH Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by WebMD, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of HLTH Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by WebMD. 

  

 (k) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by WebMD, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as WebMD may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of WebMD Class A Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled and any dividends, other distributions or payments of principal or interest to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to this Article III. 

  

 Section 3.04 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of HLTH shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of HLTH Common Stock thereafter on the records of HLTH. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing shares of HLTH Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of HLTH Common Stock, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law.

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 3.06 _Restricted Stock_. If any shares of HLTH Common Stock (the " _Restricted Shares_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any HLTH Equity Plan or other agreement with HLTH, then each holder of Restricted Shares shall not receive the Merger Consideration for the Restricted Shares, but shall instead, at the Effective Time, for each Restricted Share held, receive the number of shares of WebMD Class A Common Stock equal to (i) the Stock Consideration plus (ii) the number of shares of WebMD Class A Common Stock that would be purchasable for the Cash Consideration at the Reference Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that the aggregate number of shares of WebMD Class A Common Stock each holder of Restricted Shares receives pursuant to this Section 3.06 shall be rounded to the nearest whole number in the event such holder would otherwise receive a fractional share. The shares of WebMD Class A Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of HLTH Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same vesting schedule, repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates representing such shares of WebMD Class A Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. HLTH shall take all actions that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, WebMD is entitled to exercise any such repurchase options or other rights set forth in any such restricted stock purchase or other agreement.

Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of HLTH Common Stock held by them in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or have otherwise waived, withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares of HLTH Common Stock under such Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in and in accordance with this Article III, of the Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of HLTH Common Stock. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except for rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL.

Neither the IRS nor any other United States or non-United States taxing authority or agency is now asserting or, to the Knowledge of HLTH, threatening to assert, against HLTH or any HLTH Subsidiary any material deficiency or claim for any Taxes or interest thereon or penalties in connection therewith. The accruals and reserves for Taxes reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of HLTH and the consolidated HLTH Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 are adequate to cover all Taxes accruable through such date (including interest and penalties, if any, thereon) in accordance with GAAP and there will be no increase in accruals or reserves for Taxes from such date through the Effective Time other than for the items arising in the Ordinary Course or in connection with the Transactions, the Divestitures and the EBS Divestiture. There are no material Tax Encumbrances upon any property or assets of HLTH or any of HLTH Subsidiaries except Encumbrances for current property Taxes not yet due or that are being contested in good faith. Neither HLTH nor any HLTH Subsidiary is required to include in income in any Tax period ending after the Closing Date any adjustment pursuant to Section 481 of the Code by reason of a voluntary change in accounting method initiated by HLTH or any HLTH Subsidiary, and the IRS has not initiated or proposed any such adjustment or change in accounting method. Neither HLTH nor any HLTH Subsidiary has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution intended to qualify under Section 355(e) of the Code within the past five years. To the Knowledge of HLTH, neither HLTH nor any of its Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. HLTH is not aware of any agreement, plan or other circumstance that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. There are no outstanding agreements or waivers extending the statutory period of limitation applicable to any material Tax assessment or deficiency with respect to HLTH and each of the HLTH Subsidiaries. Neither HLTH nor any of the HLTH Subsidiaries is a real property holding company within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code. Neither HLTH nor any of the HLTH Subsidiaries has entered into a closing agreement with, or requested a ruling from, the IRS or any other taxing authority during the last three years.

Neither HLTH nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to include any item
of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any
taxable period or portion thereof ending after the Closing Date as a result
of any deferred intercompany gain or excess loss account described in
Treasury regulations under Section 1502 of the Code (or any similar provision
of state, local or foreign law) attributable to the period prior to the
Closing. Neither HLTH nor any of the HLTH Subsidiaries has participated in
any "listed transaction" or other "reportable transaction" within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4. As of December 31, 2007, (i) the
HLTH consolidated group, in the aggregate, has estimated net operating loss
carryforwards in the amount, and subject to the expiration periods, set forth
in Section 4.10 of the HLTH Disclosure Schedule and (ii) WebMD and its
Subsidiaries, in the aggregate, has estimated net operating loss
carryforwards in the amount, and subject to the expiration periods, set forth
in Section 4.10 of the HLTH Disclosure Schedule. As of the date of this
Agreement, the net operating losses set forth in Section 4.10 of the HLTH
Disclosure Schedule are not subject to any limitation under Section 382 of
the Code.

ARTICLE VI 

   

 In furtherance of, and not in limitation of, the powers conferred by law, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized and empowered: 

  

 (a) to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the stock required by law or this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent of the voting power of the then outstanding Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be required in order for the stockholders of the Corporation to alter, amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws or to adopt additional bylaws; and 

  

 (b) from time to time to determine whether and to what extent, and at what times and places, and under what conditions and regulations, the accounts and books of the Corporation, or any of them, shall be open to inspection of stockholders; and, except as so determined or as expressly provided in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or in any Preferred Stock Designation, no stockholder shall have any right to inspect any account, book or document of the Corporation other than such rights as may be conferred by applicable law. 

  

 The Corporation may in its Bylaws confer powers upon the Board of Directors in addition to the foregoing and in addition to the powers and authorities expressly conferred upon the Board of Directors by applicable law. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Restated 

  

Ex. 2.04-3  ##### 

  

    

Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least 80 percent of the voting power of the then outstanding
Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend,
repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with paragraph (a) of this Article
VI or this sentence. For purposes of this Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, "Voting Stock" shall mean the outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors. 

  

ARTICLE VII  

  

 A. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by any consent in writing in lieu of a meeting of such stockholders. 

   

 B. Special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation for any purpose or purposes may be called by the Board of Directors, and any power of stockholders to call a special meeting is specifically denied. 

   

 C. Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the election of directors and of the proposal by stockholders of any other action to be taken by the stockholders at a meeting shall be given in such manner as shall be provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation. 

   

 D. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent of the voting power of the then outstanding Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with this Article VII. 

   

ARTICLE VIII  

  

 A. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the number of directors of the Corporation shall be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors. 

   

 B. Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws of the Corporation shall so require, the election of directors of the Corporation need not be by written ballot. 

   

 C. The Board of Directors (other than those directors elected by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock provided for or fixed pursuant to the provisions of Article IV hereof (the "Preferred Stock Directors")) shall be divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III. Each class shall consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors. At each annual meeting of the stockholders, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders. If the number of directors (other than Preferred Stock Directors) is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any additional director of any class elected to fill a newly created directorship resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of 

   

Ex. 2.04-4  ##### 

  

    

directors shorten the term of any incumbent director. A director shall hold
office until the annual meeting for the year in which his term expires and
until his successor shall be elected and shall qualify, subject, however, to
prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from
office. 

   

 D. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, any director may be removed from office only for cause, and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent of the voting power of the then outstanding Voting Stock, voting together as a single class. 

   

 E. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, vacancies resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause, and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors, may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, and directors so chosen shall hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders at which the term of office of the class to which they have been elected expires and until such directors successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. No decrease in the number of authorized directors constituting the whole Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. 

   

 F. During any period when the holders of any series of Preferred Stock have the right to elect additional directors as provided for or fixed pursuant to the provisions of Article IV hereof, then upon commencement and for the duration of the period during which such right continues: (i) the then otherwise total authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall automatically be increased by such specified number of directors, and the holders of such Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect the additional directors so provided for or fixed pursuant to said provisions, and (ii) each such additional director shall serve until such directors successor shall have been duly elected and qualified, or until such directors right to hold such office terminates pursuant to said provisions, whichever occurs earlier, subject to his earlier death, disqualification, resignation or removal. Except as otherwise provided by the Board of Directors in the resolution or resolutions establishing such series, whenever the holders of any series of Preferred Stock having such right to elect additional directors are divested of such right pursuant to the provisions of such stock, the terms of office of all such additional directors elected by the holders of such stock, or elected to fill any vacancies resulting from the death, resignation, disqualification or removal of such additional directors, shall forthwith terminate and the total authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall be reduced accordingly. 

   

 G. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent of the voting power of the then outstanding Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with this Article VII. 

   

Ex. 2.04-5  ##### 

  

     

ARTICLE IX  

  

 A director of the corporation shall not be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the GCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Any amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment, modification or repeal. 

  

ARTICLE X  

  

 A. The Corporation elects to be governed by Section 203 of the GCL. 

   

 B. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent of the voting power of the then outstanding Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with this Article X. 

   

ARTICLE XI  

  

 Except as may be expressly provided in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or a Preferred Stock Designation, and any other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed herein or by applicable law, and all rights, preferences and privileges of whatsoever nature conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons whomsoever by and pursuant to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article XI.

Option Plan and the applicable option agreement issued thereunder
(including vesting provisions and provisions regarding acceleration of
vesting upon certain transactions), except that (A) each such Substitute
Option shall be exercisable for (or shall become exercisable in accordance

WebMD Class A Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares
of HLTH Common Stock subject to such Conversion HLTH Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Conversion HLTH Option Exchange
Ratio (as defined below), and (B) the option price per share of WebMD Class A
Common Stock shall be an amount equal to an amount (rounded up to the nearest
cent) equal to the quotient of (i) the exercise price per share of HLTH

Effective Time divided by (ii) the Conversion HLTH Option Exchange Ratio;
provided, however, that the exercise price otherwise determined shall
be increased to the extent, if any, required to ensure that the amount, if
any, by which the aggregate fair market value at that time of the securities
subject to the option exceeds the aggregate exercise price (the " _Option
Spread_ ") of the Substitute Option immediately after the adjustment is equal
to the Option Spread of the corresponding Conversion HLTH Option
immediately prior to the exchange. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
exercise price of, and number of shares subject to, (i) each Substitute
Option shall be determined with the intent to comply with Section 409A of the
Code, and (ii) (x) any fractional share of WebMD Class A Common Stock
resulting from an aggregation of all the shares of a holder subject to any
Conversion HLTH Option shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share and
(y) for any Conversion HLTH Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies
by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the option
price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms
and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in order to
comply with Section 424 of the Code. Each Substitute Option shall otherwise
be subject to the same terms and conditions as such Conversion HLTH
Option. As used herein, " _Conversion HLTH Option Exchange Ratio_ " means the
sum of (i) the Exchange Ratio plus (ii) the quotient of (A) the Cash
Consideration divided by (B) the closing price of a share of WebMD Class A
Common Stock on the Nasdaq on the last trading day immediately preceding
the Effective Time.

(b) _Accelerated HLTH Options_  

  

The provisions of this Exhibit 3.05(b) shall apply to all outstanding HLTH
stock options (the " _Accelerated HLTH Options_ ") under the following plans
(the " _Accelerated HLTH Stock Option Plans_ "): 

   

       |   |   | Synetic, Inc. 1998 Class E Stock Option Plan  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    |   |   | Porex Technologies Corp. 1998 Stock Option Plan  
      
    |   |   | MedE America Corporation and Its Subsidiaries 1998 Stock
Option and Restricted Stock Purchase Plan  
   

 

No less than 90 days prior to the Effective Time, HLTH shall give notice to
each holder of Accelerated HLTH Options under the Accelerated HLTH Stock
Option Plans that (i) such holders Accelerated Options shall, to the extent
unvested or unexercisable, be immediately vested and exercisable, and (ii)
such holder shall have at least 60 days from the date of the notice
to exercise the Accelerated Options, after which the Accelerated Options
shall be cancelled and forfeited; provided, however, that such cancellation
shall be contingent on the consummation of the Merger. 

   

(c) _Substitute Options_  

  

As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, WebMD shall deliver, or cause
to be delivered, to each holder of a Substitute Option an appropriate notice
setting forth such holders rights pursuant thereto and such Substitute
Option shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (including
any antidilution provisions, and subject to the adjustments required by
this Section 3.05 after giving effect to the Merger). WebMD shall comply with
the terms of all such Substitute Options and operate with the intent, subject
to the provisions of the HLTH Stock Option Plans, that (i) Substitute Options
that qualified as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code prior
to the Effective Time continue to qualify as incentive stock options after
the Effective Time and (ii) the assumption of each Conversion HLTH Option
will satisfy the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) so as not to be treated as the grant of a new stock
right or a change in the form of payment for purposes of Section 409A of the
Code. WebMD shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of WebMD Class A Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of Substitute Options pursuant to the terms set forth in this
Section 3.05. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the shares
of WebMD Class A Common Stock subject to Substitute Options will be covered
by an effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or
another appropriate form, and WebMD shall use its reasonable efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements for so long as Substitute Options remain outstanding. 

   

(d) _Section 16 of the Exchange Act_ 

  

On or after the date of the Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, each of
WebMD and HLTH shall take all necessary action such that, with respect to
each member of the HLTH Board and each employee of HLTH that is subject to
Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the acquisition by such Person of WebMD Class
A Common Stock or Substitute Options in the Merger and the disposition by any
such Person of WebMD Class A Common Stock or HLTH stock options pursuant to
the Transactions contemplated by the Agreement shall be exempt from the
short-swing profit liability rules of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated thereunder.
