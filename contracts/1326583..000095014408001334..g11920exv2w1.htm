corporate or limited liability company power and authority and all necessary Governmental Approvals
to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,
except where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have such power,

aggregate, to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions or otherwise prevent or
materially delay WebMD from performing its obligations under this Agreement, and could not

character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed

or materially delay consummation of the Transactions or otherwise prevent or materially delay WebMD
from performing its obligations under this Agreement and could not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a WebMD Material Adverse Effect.
