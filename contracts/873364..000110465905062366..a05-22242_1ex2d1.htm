5   

     
   

  



  

7.5 If the obligations of the Purchaser under subclause 7.2 and Part 2 of

fails to comply the Sellers Representatives may and, if the Sellers fail to
comply the Purchaser may:

defer Completion (so that the provisions of this clause 7 shall apply to
Completion as so deferred and the Completion Date shall be such deferred
date); or

  



  

(b) proceed to Completion so far as practicable (without limiting its rights
under this agreement); or

of Schedule 10, all of the provisions of this agreement shall lapse and cease
to have effect; but

  



  

(b) neither the lapsing of those provisions nor their ceasing to have effect
shall affect any accrued rights or liabilities of any party in respect of
damages for non-performance of any obligation under this agreement
falling due for performance prior to such lapse and cessation; and

  



  

(c) for the avoidance of doubt any claim by or right of the Purchaser
to claim against the Warrantors for any breach of the General Warranties

Purchaser on demand and on an after Tax basis the amount equal to the
Leakage, if any, received by that Seller or any of its Related Persons

 **12.** ** SELLERS REPRESENTATIVES AND SELLERS AGENT**

  



  

12.1 Each Seller appoints and authorises the Sellers Representatives to act

9

any Group Company is required to deduct, withhold or pay to any relevant Tax
Authority with respect to the payment of such proportion of the Redemption
Amount to that person. The Purchaser will account or procure that Zeneus
Pharma Limited or the Relevant Group Company accounts to the relevant Tax
Authority in respect of any such deduction or withholding under this clause
and to the extent that it does so it will not be required to pay any
additional or compensatory amount in respect of such deduction or
withholding. To the extent that it is established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Purchaser that no amounts need to be deducted or withheld
by any Group Company under this clause, no amounts will be deducted from the

Mayr or Sir Richard Sykes.

(b) it does not rely on and has not been induced to enter into this agreement
on the basis of any warranties, representations, covenants, undertakings or
any other statement whatsoever other than expressly set out in this
agreement.

Guarantor as though the same had been incurred by the Purchaser Guarantor and
the Purchaser Guarantor were the sole or principal obligor in respect thereof
and shall be performed or paid by the Purchaser Guarantor on demand.

  



  

16.5 The obligations of the Purchaser Guarantor under this clause 16 shall

any confidential information shall promptly notify the other parties, where
practicable and lawful to do so, before disclosure occurs and co-operate with

19.6 Nothing in this clause prevents disclosure of confidential information
by any party:

  



  

(a) to the extent that the information is in or comes into the public domain
other than as a result of a breach of any undertaking or duty

(b) to that partys professional advisers, auditors or bankers, but before
any disclosure to any such person the relevant party shall procure that he is
made aware of the terms of this clause and shall use all
reasonable endeavours to procure that such person adheres to those terms as
if he were bound by the provisions of this clause.

  



  

19.7 Nothing in this agreement is intended to vary, repeal or in any

assurance (except those set out in this agreement and the documents referred
to in it) made by or on behalf of any other party before the signature of
this agreement. Each party waives all rights and remedies which, but for this
subclause, might otherwise be available to it in respect of any such

PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY

INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY AMONGST OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATES IN THIS SUBCLAUSE.**

 **1.2** Ownership of Assets

  

 ** **

  

(a) Except in the ordinary course of business, no company has since the
Accounts Date disposed of or agreed to dispose of any of the material assets
included in the Accounts (and for the purposes of this paragraph **a material
asset** means an asset with a book value of US$10,000 or more or which
generates revenue of US$10,000 or more per annum).

  



  

(b) None of the property, assets, undertaking, goodwill or uncalled capital

title claims or liens arising in the ordinary course of business).

  



  

(c) Each Group Company owns, or has a valid licence to use, all assets that
are necessary to carry on its business in the manner it is being carried out
as at the date of this agreement.

capital of the Company.

  



  

(b) The Company has not granted any options to subscribe for any unissued

member of the Group have been validly issued and allotted and are fully paid.

  



  

(d) No person is entitled or has since 12 February 2004 claimed to be
entitled to require any Group Company to issue any share or loan capital
either now or at any future date whether contingently or not.

  



  

(e) Other than as set out in the articles of association of each Subsidiary
there is no right of pre-emption, restriction on transfer or Encumbrance on,
over or affecting any shares held by any member of the Group in any other
member of the Group and, so far as the Warrantors are aware, no person has
claimed to be entitled to any of the foregoing.

  



  

(f) Part 2 of Schedule 1 lists all the subsidiaries of the Company and no
Group Company:

  



  

(i) holds or beneficially owns or has agreed to acquire any securities of any
other corporation which is not a member of the Group and so listed; or

  



  

(ii) is or has agreed to become a member of any partnership (whether
incorporated or unincorporated) or other unincorporated association, joint
venture or consortium (other than recognised trade associations).

  



  

40   

     
   

  



  

(g) The Group Companies are duly incorporated and validly existing under the
laws of the jurisdiction in which they are incorporated.

  



  

 **1.4** Compliance with Statutes

  

 ** **

  

(a) Since 12 February 2004, no Group Company, nor any of their respective
officers, agents or employees (during the course of their duties) has done or
omitted to do anything which is a contravention of any statute, order,
regulation or the like giving rise to any fine, penalty, default proceedings
or other liability which may have a material adverse effect upon the Group.

  



  

(b) There is no order, decree or judgment of any court or governmental agency
outstanding against and notified in writing to any Group Company which, so
far as the Warrantors are aware, may have a material adverse effect upon the

 ** **

  

The Group Companies have all licences (including statutory licences) and
consents necessary to own the assets of each Group Company and to carry on
their business as carried on in the 12 months prior to the date of this
agreement and, so far as the Warrantors are aware, there is nothing that
could reasonably be expected to result in the revocation, suspension or
modification of any of those licences or consents or that could reasonably be
expected to prejudice their renewal. For the avoidance of doubt the reference
to licences in this paragraph 1.5 is not taken to refer to licences
of Intellectual Property.

  



  

 **1.6** Litigation

  

 ** **

  

(a) No Group Company nor, so far as the Warrantors are aware, any person for
whose act or default any Group Company is vicariously liable, is engaged in

pending or, so far as the Warrantors are aware, threatened by or against any
Group Company.

to any Property;

(d) no Group Company has failed to comply with any and all applicable
legislation or regulations of any jurisdiction with regard to the use,
treatment, handling, storage, transport, disposal, spillage, release,
discharge, leak or emission of any waste or hazardous substance or any
substance likely to impair the environment or harm human health or animal
health or otherwise relating to environmental matters or the health and
safety of any person, or that there has otherwise been any such use,
treatment, handling, storage, transport, disposal,

  



  

41   

     
   

  

spillage, release, discharge, leak or emission (whether or not the same
constituted a non-compliance by any person with any such legislation or
regulations, and wherever the same may have taken place) which, in any case,
would be likely to give rise to any liability (actual of contingent) or cost
on the part of any member of the Group in any case to an extent which is
material and adverse in the context or the Group taken as a whole.

  



  

 **1.8** Insolvency

 ** **

pharmacovigilance reporting requirements in force in each of the
jurisdictions where it is authorised, and, so far as the Warrantors are

the Warrantors as soon as reasonably practicable after the date on which it
becomes aware of that matter, specifying reasonable details to the extent the

in respect of any of the General Warranties in paragraph 6 of Part 2 of
Schedule 3 to this agreement) shall in any event terminate if proceedings in
respect of it have not been commenced or the claim has not been settled
within six months after the giving of notice of that General Warranty Claim
(subject always to paragraph 8 and subject further where the Purchaser is
required to do anything or omit to do anything under paragraphs 4 or 7, the
commencement of the relevant 6 month time period will be extended by such
additional time it takes to comply with the Warrantors requirements and

pursue any or defend any third party claim in accordance with those clauses).

  



  

 **4.** Third party claims

  

 ** **

  

4.1 Subject to paragraph 5, in circumstances where any claim, action or
demand by a third party arises which gives rise to a General Warranty Claim

Warrantors to its reasonable satisfaction against any claims, costs, expenses
and other liabilities as may be incurred, take such action and initiate such
proceedings, and give such information and assistance, as the Warrantors may
from time to time reasonably request to dispute, resist, appeal, compromise,
defend, remedy or mitigate the matter in question or enforce against the
relevant third party the rights of the Purchaser or relevant Group Companies
in relation to the matter in question.

  



  

4.2 The Purchaser shall:

  



  

consult with the Warrantors as soon as reasonably practicable with regard to
any actual or proposed developments relating to the matter contemplated by
paragraph 4.1 above and provide the Warrantors at the Warrantors  cost with
copies of all relevant correspondence and documents in relation to that
matter; and

  



  

not admit liability in respect of or settle or compromise such matter without
the prior written consent of the Warrantors, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  



  

 **5.** Qualification to Third Party Claim Provisions

  

 ** **

  

Notwithstanding any other provision of paragraph 4 of this Schedule (the
**Third Party Claims Clauses** ), the Third Party Claims Clauses shall not
apply:

  



  

to the extent that their application would, or would be reasonably likely to,
have a material adverse effect on the financial, trading or other prospects
of any member of the Group; and/or

  



  

to the extent their application would or would be reasonably likely to damage
the goodwill of any member of the Group; and/or

  



  

to the extent that the General Warranty Claim is or becomes subject to
recovery under the Warranty Insurance Policy at the time negotiation,
litigation or arbitration with regard to the relevant matter being the
subject of the General Warranty Claim is commenced; and/or

  



  

to the extent that their application would in any way prejudice the
Purchasers claim against the Warrantors.

  



  

58   

     
   

  



  

 **6.** Mitigation

  

 ** **

  

Nothing in this agreement shall be deemed to relieve the Purchaser from any
common law duty to mitigate any loss or damage incurred by it as a result of
any of the Warranties being untrue or inaccurate.

  



  

 **7.** Recovery from Insurance

  

 ** **

  

Without prejudice to the Purchasers duty to mitigate any loss in respect of
any of the Warrantors Warranties being untrue or inaccurate, where a breach
of any of the General Warranties shall be in respect of a matter where any
Group Company shall be insured against any loss or damage or shall have a
valid claim under the Shamrock Tax Deed or any express indemnity under the
Shamrock Sale and Purchase Agreement arising therefrom, the Purchaser shall
not make any claim against the Warrantors for breach of any such General
Warranty without first procuring that the relevant Group Company shall make a
claim against its insurers or, where applicable, the relevant third party for
compensation for the loss or damage suffered (provided that this provision
shall not preclude the Purchaser from notifying the Warrantors of a claim in
accordance with paragraph 3 and, for the avoidance of doubt, does not apply
in relation to any claims against the Insurer under the Warranty Insurance
Policy).  Any claim against the Warrantors shall be limited (in addition to
