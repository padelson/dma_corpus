as contemplated by this _Section 3.1(b)_.

 


 

 

(vi) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, UTC shall prepare and
file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable
form) registering the shares of UTC Common Stock necessary to fulfill UTC's 
obligations under this _Section 3.1(b)_. UTC shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of UTC 
Common Stock for delivery with respect to the Raytheon Equity Awards assumed

(c) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional share of UTC Common Stock (or
certificate or scrip representing the same) shall be issued upon the
conversion or  surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
hereunder, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to any UTC Common Stock or to vote or to any other rights of a holder
of UTC Common Stock. Each holder of  shares of Raytheon Common Stock
converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of UTC Common Stock (after taking into account
all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder)  shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such
fraction as provided in this _Section 3.1(c)_. As promptly as  practicable
following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of
(i) the number of full shares of UTC Common Stock delivered to the Exchange
Agent by UTC for issuance to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares over
(ii)  the aggregate number of full shares of UTC Common Stock to be
distributed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (such excess being
herein referred to as the " _Excess Shares_ "). As soon as practicable after
the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for such holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, shall sell the Excess Shares at then
prevailing prices  on the NYSE. The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange
Agent shall be executed on the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the
extent practicable. Until the net proceeds of any such sale or sales have been
distributed to the holders of  Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the
Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for such holders. The net
proceeds of any such sale or sales of Excess Shares to be distributed to the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be  reduced by any and all
commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, as well
as any expenses, of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale
or sales. The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of such net 
proceeds to which each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share
interest to which such  holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares is
entitled (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
then held by such holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount
of fractional share interests to which all  holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares are entitled. As soon as practicable after the determination of
the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares with respect to any fractional share interests, the  Exchange
Agent shall promptly

 


 

 

 

-8-  

pay such amounts to such holders subject to and in accordance with this
_Section 3.1(c)_ ; _provided_ that no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares shall be paid to any such holder  pursuant to this _Section 3.1(c)_
until the surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance
with this _Article III_. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional share
interests pursuant to this _Section   3.1(c)_ is not separately bargained-
for consideration.

 


 

 

(d) _No Dissenters ' Rights_. In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no
appraisal rights shall be available to holders of Raytheon Common Stock or
UTC  Common Stock in connection with the Merger.

 


 

 

Section 3.2. _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_.

 


 

 

(a) _Designation of Exchange Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the
Closing, UTC shall enter into a customary exchange agreement with the transfer
agent  of UTC, the transfer agent of Raytheon or another nationally
recognized financial institution or trust company designated by UTC and
reasonably acceptable to Raytheon (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment
of the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(a)(i)_. Prior to or 
substantially concurrently with the Effective Time, UTC shall deposit or cause
to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for exchange in accordance with this
_Article              III_ through the Exchange Agent, book-entry
shares representing the full number of whole shares of UTC Common Stock
issuable pursuant to _Section  3.1(a)(i)_ in exchange for outstanding shares
of Raytheon Common Stock, and UTC shall, after the Effective Time on the
appropriate payment date, if applicable, provide or cause to be provided to
the Exchange Agent any dividends or other  distributions payable on such
shares of UTC Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.2(d)_ (such shares of UTC
Common Stock provided to the Exchange Agent,  together with any such
dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_
").

 


 

 

(b) _Letters of Transmittal and Instructions for Surrender_. As promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time, and in no event later than the fifth
(5th)  business day thereafter, UTC shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") that immediately
prior  to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Raytheon
Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery of
Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass only upon proper  delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in the form
and have such other provisions as are reasonably acceptable to UTC and
Raytheon) and (ii) instructions (which instructions  shall be in the form and
have such other provisions as are reasonably acceptable to UTC and Raytheon)
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for (A) the
number of shares of UTC Common Stock (which shall be in book-entry  form)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder
has the right to receive in respect of such Certificates pursuant to
_Section  3.1(a)(i)_ , (B) any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to _Section 3.2(d)_ and (C) cash in lieu of fractional shares of
UTC  Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_.

 


 

 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a
letter  of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant
to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall

 


 

 

 

-9-  


 

 

be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the number of shares of UTC
Common Stock (which shall be in book-entry form) representing,  in the
aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to
receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(i)_ , 
(ii) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 3.2(d)_
and (iii) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of UTC Common Stock  payable
pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ , and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. No holder  of
record of a book-entry share (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Raytheon Common 
Stock shall be required to deliver a Certificate or letter of transmittal or
surrender such Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, and in lieu thereof,
each Book-Entry Share shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled
to receive (x) the  number of shares of UTC Common Stock (which shall be in
book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares
that such holder has the right to receive in respect of such Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(i)_ , (y) any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to _Section   3.2(d)_ and (z) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of UTC Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_.
Until surrendered, in the  case of a Certificate, or paid for, in the case of
a Book-Entry Share, in each case, as contemplated by this _Section 3.2(c)_ ,
each Certificate or  Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the
Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this _Section   3.2(c)_ and any dividends
or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 3.2(d)_. The Exchange
Agent shall accept such Certificates  (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
and make such payments and deliveries with respect to Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in  accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration
or any cash payable hereunder.

 


 

 

(d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. Subject to Applicable
Law, there shall be paid to the holders of the UTC Common Stock issued in
exchange  for Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_
, without interest, (i) at the time of delivery of such UTC Common Stock by
the  Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_ , the amount of dividends or
other distributions, if any, with a record date after the Effective Time 
theretofore paid with respect to such shares of UTC Common Stock, and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions,
if any, with a record date after the Effective Time, but prior to such
delivery of such UTC  Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section
3.2(c)_ , and a payment date subsequent to such delivery of such UTC Common
Stock by the Exchange  Agent pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_ , payable with
respect to such shares of UTC Common Stock.

 


 

 

(e) _Certain Transfers of Ownership_. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of Raytheon Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of 
Raytheon, payment of the appropriate amount of Merger Consideration (and any
dividends or other distributions with respect to UTC Common Stock as
contemplated by _Section              3.2(d)_ ) may be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer (and  accompanied by all
documents reasonably required by the Exchange Agent) or such Book-Entry Share
shall be properly transferred and the person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person 
other than the

 


 

 

 

-10-  

registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of UTC that such Tax has been paid  or is not
applicable.

 


 

 

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming  such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required
by UTC or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as UTC may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect  to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this
_Article III_.

 


 

 

(g) _No Further Ownership Rights in Raytheon Common Stock_. All shares of UTC
Common Stock (together with cash in lieu of fractional shares of UTC Common
Stock  payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ ) issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of
this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Raytheon Common Stock
theretofore  represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. After the
Effective Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of Raytheon of shares of Raytheon Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time. If Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares are presented to UTC, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for transfer following the Effective Time, they shall be
canceled against delivery of the applicable Merger Consideration for  each
share of Raytheon Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares.

 


 

 

(h) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for one  (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to UTC or its
designee upon demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to UTC
as general creditor thereof for payment of their claims for Merger
Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to UTC Common
Stock as  contemplated by _Section 3.2(d)_.

 


 

 

(i) _No Liability_. None of UTC, Merger Sub, Raytheon or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of UTC Common Stock
(or  dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash held in the
Exchange Fund delivered to a Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have
been surrendered or  Book-Entry Share not paid, in each case, in accordance
with _Section 3.2(c)_ , immediately prior to the date on which any Merger
Consideration in respect  of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any
such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,  become the property of UTC
free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.

 


 

 

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Each of UTC, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts  otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person such
amounts as are required to be

 

 

-11-  


 

 

deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law. Any amounts so  withheld shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 


 

 

Section 3.3. _Certain Adjustments._ Without limiting the other provisions of
this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the execution of this
Agreement and the  Effective Time, any change in the number or type of
outstanding shares of UTC Common Stock or Raytheon Common Stock shall occur as
a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, exchange, stock split
(including a reverse stock split),  combination or readjustment of shares or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as
the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to  provide the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ that (a) no such adjustment shall be made as a result or in respect
of the Separation or either or both of the Distributions and (b) nothing in
this _Section 3.3_ shall be construed to permit any party to take any action
that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this
Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 3.4. _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is determined by UTC or the Surviving Corporation to be
necessary or desirable  to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to
vest the Surviving Corporation or UTC with full right, title and possession of
and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and Raytheon with respect to the
Merger, the officers and managers of UTC  shall be fully authorized (in the
name of Merger Sub, Raytheon, the Surviving Corporation and otherwise) to take
such action.

in any Raytheon SEC Document filed with the SEC since January 1, 2017 and
publicly available  prior to the date of this Agreement (as amended prior to
the date of this Agreement, the " _Raytheon Filed SEC Documents_ ") (excluding
any disclosures in any risk factors section, in any section related to
forward-looking statements and other  disclosures that are predictive or
forward-looking in nature) or as disclosed in the disclosure letter delivered
by Raytheon to UTC upon the execution of this Agreement (the " _Raytheon
Disclosure Letter_ ") and making reference to the  particular subsection of
this Agreement to which exception is being taken ( _provided_ that such
disclosure shall be deemed to qualify that particular subsection and such
other subsections of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably 
apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure also qualifies
or applies to such other subsections), Raytheon represents and warrants to UTC

has the requisite corporate or other power, as the case may be, and authority
to carry on its business as  now being conducted, except, as to subsidiaries,

 


 

 

 

-12-  

for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so organized, existing or in
good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not  reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Raytheon. Each of Raytheon and
its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each 
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed or in good  standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Raytheon. The
Certificate of Incorporation of Raytheon and the Bylaws of Raytheon, in each
case as amended through the date of this  Agreement, have been filed prior to
the date of this Agreement with the Raytheon Filed SEC Documents.

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall not, conflict with,
or result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse

cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of a benefit under, or
result in the creation of any pledge, claim, lien, charge, encumbrance or
security interest of any kind or  nature whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_

their respective dates, the Raytheon SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
" _Securities              Act_ "), the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the
case may be, and the rules and  regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder
applicable to the Raytheon SEC Documents, and none of the Raytheon SEC
Documents when filed and at their respective effective times, if applicable,
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or  omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,

statements, as permitted by the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly
present in  all material respects the consolidated financial position of

Raytheon's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 13, 2019,
(B)  for liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since December 31, 2018 and (C) for
liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with or contemplated by
this Agreement, neither Raytheon  nor any of its subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a
consolidated balance sheet of Raytheon and its subsidiaries (or in  the notes
thereto) that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Raytheon.

 


 

 

(iv) Raytheon maintains a system of "internal control over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)

Raytheon's independent accountants, the Board of Directors of Raytheon or its
audit committee has received any oral or written  notification of any (1)
"significant deficiency" in the internal controls over financial reporting of
Raytheon, (2) "material weakness" in the internal controls over financial
reporting of Raytheon or (3) fraud, whether or not material, that involves 
management or other employees of Raytheon who have a significant role in the
internal controls over financial reporting of Raytheon.

 


 

 

(v) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by Raytheon are reasonably
designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) 
required to be disclosed by Raytheon in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information  required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of Raytheon, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of Raytheon to make  the certifications required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

 


 

 

(vi) Neither Raytheon nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating  to any transaction or relationship between or among Raytheon and
any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
person, on the other hand, or  any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the
purpose

 


 

 

 

-17-  

or intended effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material  liabilities of, Raytheon or any of its
subsidiaries in Raytheon's or such subsidiary's published financial statements
or other Raytheon SEC Documents.

 


 

 

(f) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied

will,  at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, and at any time it is
amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the

to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading, or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the
date it is first mailed to Raytheon's stockholders or  at the time of the
Raytheon Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances  under
which they are made, not misleading. The Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy
Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or
warranty is made by Raytheon with respect to statements made or incorporated
by reference therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of UTC for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in  the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement.

documents (including exhibits and all other information incorporated
therein,  regardless of when such exhibits and other information were filed)
with the SEC since January 1, 2017 (the " _UTC SEC Documents_ "). As of
their  respective dates, the UTC SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the
SEC promulgated thereunder  applicable to the UTC SEC Documents, and none of
the UTC SEC Documents when filed and at their respective effective times, if
applicable, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated  therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC with  respect to any
of the UTC SEC Documents, and, to the knowledge of UTC, none of the UTC SEC

schedules) of UTC and its subsidiaries included in the UTC SEC Documents (the
" _UTC Financial Statements_ ") were prepared in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the  periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of UTC and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results

 


 

 

 

-31-  

of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the

not material and to any other adjustments described therein, including the

course of business consistent with past practice since December 31, 2018 and
(C) for liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with or
contemplated by this Agreement  or the Separation and the Distributions,
neither UTC nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of
any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be
required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated  balance sheet of UTC and
its subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto) that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
UTC.

 


 

 

(iv) UTC maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting" (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to

to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP,

accountants, the Board of Directors of UTC or its audit committee has received
any oral or written notification of any  (1) "significant deficiency" in the
internal controls over financial reporting of UTC, (2) "material weakness" in
the internal controls over financial reporting of UTC or (3) fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees  of UTC who have a
significant role in the internal controls over financial reporting of UTC.

 


 

 

(v) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by UTC are reasonably designed to
ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to 
be disclosed by UTC in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such information
required to be  disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the management
of UTC, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of UTC to make the certifications  required under the Exchange Act
with respect to such reports.

 


 

 

(vi) Neither UTC nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating to  any transaction or relationship between or among UTC and any of
its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person,
on the other hand, or any  "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as

 


 

 

 

-32-  

defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the
purpose or intended effect of such  contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, UTC or any of its
subsidiaries in UTC's or such subsidiary's published financial statements or
other UTC SEC Documents.

 


 

 

(f) _Information Supplied_.

 


 

 

(i) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by UTC for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4
is filed with the SEC, and at any time it is amended or supplemented or  at
the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the  circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or
(ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to UTC's
stockholders or at the time of the UTC Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or  omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. The Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement shall comply as  to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by UTC with respect to
statements made  or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by or on behalf of Raytheon for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement.

 


 

 

(ii) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by UTC or any of its
subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the SpinCo
Registration Statements will, at the time each such SpinCo Registration
Statement  becomes effective under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as
applicable, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in  the light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading. The SpinCo Registration Statements shall comply as
to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act or
the Securities Act, as applicable, and the  rules and regulations thereunder.

-50-  

modifications or consents in relation to existing indebtedness) (any such

the subsidiaries of UTC RemainCo) agree, to the extent requested by the other,

its subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such information, (B)
in the reasonable good faith judgment of such party, the information is
subject to confidentiality obligations to a third party or (C) disclosure  of
any such information or document would result in the loss of attorney-client
privilege, attorney work product or other relevant legal privilege; _provided_
  that, with respect to clauses (A) through (C) of this _Section 5.1(e)_ ,
Raytheon or UTC, as applicable, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to (1) obtain the required consent of any third  party necessary to provide
such disclosure, (2) develop an alternative to providing such information so
as to address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to the other party
and (3) utilize the procedures of a joint defense agreement or  implement
such other techniques if the parties determine that doing so would reasonably
permit the disclosure of such information without violating Applicable Law or
jeopardizing such privilege.

(a) Raytheon shall not, and  shall cause its controlled affiliates and its
and their officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, financial

_Representative_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information), or take any
other action to facilitate, any inquiries regarding,  or the making of, any
proposal the consummation of which would constitute a Raytheon Alternative
Transaction, or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations, or
cooperate in any way with any person (or group of persons), with respect to 
any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the consummation of
which would constitute a Raytheon Alternative Transaction; _provided_   that,

Board of Directors of Raytheon determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside counsel and financial advisors) that any such proposal that
did not  result from a breach of this _Section 5.2(a)_ constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Raytheon Superior Proposal, subject to 
compliance with _Section 5.2(c)_ , Raytheon and its

 


 

 

 

-51-  

Representatives may (A) furnish information with respect to Raytheon and its
subsidiaries to the person (or group of persons) making such proposal (and
its  Representatives) ( _provided_ that all such information has previously
been provided to UTC or is provided to UTC prior to or substantially
concurrent  with the time it is provided to such person) pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality terms generally
no less restrictive than the terms of the confidentiality agreement, effective
as of December 11, 2018,  between Raytheon and UTC (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding
such proposal with the  person (or group of persons) making such proposal and
its Representatives. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Raytheon Alternative
Transaction_ "  means any of (1) a transaction or series of transactions

the resulting company, acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly,
beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of, or
would otherwise own or  control, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of the
outstanding shares of Raytheon Common Stock or securities (or options, rights
or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for,
such securities) representing more  than 20% or more of the equity or voting
power of Raytheon (or the resulting company), (2) a merger, consolidation,
share exchange or similar transaction pursuant to which any Raytheon Third
Party acquires or would acquire, directly or  indirectly, assets or

or more of the revenues, net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated
basis) of Raytheon and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, (3) any 
transaction pursuant to which any Raytheon Third Party acquires or would
acquire, directly or indirectly, control of assets (including for this purpose
the outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries of Raytheon and any entity
surviving any  merger or combination including any of them) of Raytheon or
any of its subsidiaries representing more than 20% or more of the revenues,
net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of Raytheon and
its subsidiaries taken as a whole,  or (4) any disposition of assets to a
Raytheon Third Party representing more than 20% or more of the revenues, net
income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of Raytheon and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole. For purposes of this  Agreement, a "
_Raytheon Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written proposal (on its
most recently amended or modified terms, if amended or  modified) made by a
Raytheon Third Party to enter into a Raytheon Alternative Transaction (with
all references to 20% in the definition of Raytheon Alternative Transaction
being treated as references to 50% for these purposes) that (A) did not 
result from a breach of this _Section 5.2(a)_ , (B) is on terms that the Board
of Directors of Raytheon determines in good faith (after consultation  with
its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel) to be superior from
a financial point of view to Raytheon's stockholders than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account all relevant factors
(including any  changes to this Agreement that may be proposed by UTC in
response to such proposal to enter into a Raytheon Alternative Transaction and
the identity of the person making such proposal to enter into a Raytheon
Alternative Transaction) and (C) is  reasonably likely to be completed in
accordance with its terms, taking into account all financial, regulatory,
legal and other aspects of such proposal, and is not subject to a diligence or
financing condition.

 


 

 

(b) Except as permitted by this  _Section 5.2(b)_ or _Section 5.2(d)_ ,
neither the  Board of Directors of Raytheon nor any committee thereof shall
(i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or
modify, or fail to make, in each case in a manner

 


 

 

 

-52-  

adverse to UTC, the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or
such committee of the Merger or this Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend,
or  propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Raytheon Alternative
Transaction, (iii) fail to include in the Joint Proxy Statement the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of Raytheon in favor of this
Agreement and the Merger, (iv) fail to  send to its securityholders, within
ten (10) business days after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer
relating to shares of Raytheon Common Stock (or, if earlier, at least two (2)
business days prior to the Raytheon Stockholders  Meeting), a statement
disclosing that Raytheon recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer
and reaffirming its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger or (v)
fail to publicly reaffirm its recommendation of this Agreement and the 
Merger within ten (10) business days of UTC's written request to do so (or, if
earlier, at least two (2) business days prior to the Raytheon Stockholders'
Meeting) following the public announcement of any Raytheon Alternative
Transaction (or any  material amendment, including any change to the price or
form of consideration); _provided_ , that UTC shall not be entitled to make
such written  request, and the Board of Directors of Raytheon shall not be
required to make such reaffirmation, more than once with respect to any
particular Raytheon Alternative Transaction (or any material amendment
thereto, including any change to the price  or form of consideration) (any
action or failure to act in clauses (i) through (v) being referred to as a "
_Raytheon Recommendation Change_ ").   Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that, prior to obtaining the Raytheon Stockholder Approval, the Board of
Directors of Raytheon determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,  that it has received a
Raytheon Superior Proposal that was not solicited, initiated, knowingly
encouraged or facilitated or otherwise procured in violation of this
Agreement, the Board of Directors of Raytheon may effect a Raytheon
Recommendation  Change (other than under clause (ii) of this _Section 5.2(b)_
) if (A) the Board of Directors of Raytheon determines in good faith, after 
consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law, (B) Raytheon has notified UTC in writing that it
intends to  effect a Raytheon Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section
5.2(b)_ (other than under clause (ii) of this _Section 5.2(b)_ ), (C) Raytheon
has provided UTC with a copy of the proposed definitive agreements and other
proposed transaction documentation between Raytheon and the person  making
such Raytheon Superior Proposal, and the identity of the person making such
Raytheon Superior Proposal, (D) for a period of four (4) business days
following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (B) of this _Section 5.2(b)_
, Raytheon shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith and made
Raytheon's Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good faith
(in each case  to the extent UTC desires to negotiate) with UTC's
Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so that the
failure to take such action would no longer  be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law of the Board of Directors of Raytheon
(it being understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term or
condition of any Raytheon Superior Proposal shall require a new notice  and a
new negotiation period that shall expire on the later to occur of (I) two (2)
business days following delivery of such new notice from Raytheon to UTC and
(II) the expiration of the original four (4)-business day period described in
clause  (D) above), and (E) no earlier than the end of such negotiation
period, the Board of Directors of Raytheon shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, and after  considering the terms of any proposed amendment or
modification to this

 

 

-53-  

Agreement, that (x) the Raytheon Alternative Transaction that is the subject
of the notice described in clause (B) above still constitutes a Raytheon
Superior  Proposal and (y) the failure to take such action would still be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. Neither the Board
of Directors of Raytheon nor any committee thereof shall cause or permit
Raytheon or any of its  controlled affiliates to enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement
related to any Raytheon Alternative Transaction or requiring, or reasonably
likely to cause, Raytheon to terminate, delay  or fail to consummate, or that
would otherwise impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the
consummation of the Merger (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to
in _Section 5.2(a)_ ).

 


 

 

(c) In  addition to the obligations of Raytheon set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_
and _Section 5.2(b)_ , Raytheon shall promptly, and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours of receipt thereof, advise UTC orally and in writing of
any request for information or proposal relating to a  Raytheon Alternative
Transaction, the material terms and conditions of such request or proposal
(including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making such
request or proposal. Raytheon shall (i) keep UTC reasonably informed of  the
status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such
request or proposal on a reasonably current basis and (ii) provide to UTC as
soon as reasonably practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of
all  correspondence and other written materials exchanged between Raytheon or
its subsidiaries or any of their Representatives, on the one hand, and any
person making such request or proposal or any of its Representatives, on the
other hand, in each  case that describes or contains any such request or
proposal.

 


 

 

(d) Other  than in connection with a Raytheon Superior Proposal (which shall
be subject to _Section 5.2(b)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section
5.2(d)_ ), prior to obtaining the Raytheon Stockholder Approval, the Board of
Directors of Raytheon may, in response to a Raytheon Intervening Event, take
any action prohibited by clauses (i) or  (iii) of _Section 5.2(b)_ , only if
(i) the Board of Directors of Raytheon determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that the failure to  take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, (ii) Raytheon has notified UTC in
writing that it intends to effect such a Raytheon Recommendation Change (under
clauses (i) or (iii) of _Section 5.2(b)_ ) pursuant to this _Section 5.2(d)_
(which notice shall  specify the facts and circumstances providing the basis
of the Raytheon Intervening Event and for the determination by the Board of
Directors of Raytheon to effect a Raytheon Recommendation Change under clauses
(i) or (iii) of _Section 5.2(b)_ in reasonable detail), (iii) for a period of
four (4) business days following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (ii)
of this _Section 5.2(d)_ , Raytheon shall have discussed and negotiated in
good faith and made Raytheon's Representatives available to discuss and
negotiate in  good faith (in each case to the extent UTC desires to
negotiate) with UTC's Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement so that the failure to take  such action would no longer be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties under Applicable Law of the Board of
Directors of Raytheon (it being understood and agreed that any material change
to the relevant facts and circumstances shall require a new  notice and a new
negotiation period that shall expire on the later to occur of (A) two (2)
business days following delivery of such new notice from Raytheon to UTC and
(B) the expiration of the original four (4)-business day period described 
above in this clause (iii)), and (iv) no earlier than the end of such
negotiation period,

 


 

 

 

-54-  

the Board of Directors of Raytheon shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisors and  outside legal counsel,
and after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to
this Agreement, that the failure to take such action would still be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. The term "
_Raytheon Intervening Event_ " means a material event or circumstance that was
not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors of Raytheon  on
the date of this Agreement (or if known or reasonably foreseeable, the
consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Board of
Directors of Raytheon of the date of this Agreement), which event or
circumstance, or any  consequence thereof, becomes known to the Board of
Directors of Raytheon prior to the Raytheon Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
that (1) in no  event shall any inquiry, offer or proposal that constitutes
or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Raytheon Alternative Transaction
constitute a Raytheon Intervening Event, (2) in no event shall any change in
and of itself in the market  price or trading volume of the securities of UTC
constitute a Raytheon Intervening Event (it being understood that the facts or
occurrences giving rise or contributing to such change may constitute or be
taken into account in determining whether  there has been a Raytheon
Intervening Event), and (3) in no event shall any event or circumstances to
the extent relating to the Otis Business or the Carrier Business constitute a
Raytheon Intervening Event.

 


 

 

(e) Nothing contained in this  _Section 5.2_ shall prohibit Raytheon from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)  promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a
"stop, look and listen" statement or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its
position thereunder; _provided_ that any such disclosure or statement that
constitutes or contains a Raytheon Recommendation Change shall be subject to
the provisions of _Section 5.2(b)_.

 


 

 

Section 5.3. _No Solicitation by UTC_.

 


 

 

(a) UTC shall  not, and shall cause its controlled affiliates, and its and
their officers, directors, employees and Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing information), or  take any other action to facilitate, any
inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the consummation of which
would constitute a UTC Alternative Transaction or (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations, or cooperate in any way  with any person (or
group of persons), with respect to any inquiries regarding, or the making of,
any proposal the consummation of which would constitute a UTC Alternative
Transaction; _provided_ that, if, at any time prior to obtaining the UTC
Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of UTC determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors)  that
any such proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.3(a)_
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a UTC  Superior
Proposal, subject to compliance with _Section 5.3(c)_ , UTC and its
Representatives may (A) furnish information with respect to UTC and its 
subsidiaries to the person (or group of persons) making such proposal (and its
Representatives) ( _provided_ that all such information has previously  been
provided to Raytheon or is provided to Raytheon prior to or substantially
concurrent with the time it is provided to such person) pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality terms generally
no less  restrictive than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such proposal with the
person (or group of persons) making such proposal and its

 


 

 

 

-55-  

Representatives. For purposes of this Agreement, " _UTC Alternative
Transaction_ " means any of (1) a transaction or series of transactions
pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) other than Raytheon and its
subsidiaries (such person (or group of  persons), a " _UTC Third Party_ "),
or the direct or indirect stockholders of such UTC Third Party or the
resulting company, acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly,
beneficial ownership (as  defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of,
or would otherwise own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of
the outstanding shares of UTC Common Stock or securities (or options, rights
or warrants to purchase, or securities  convertible into or exchangeable for,
such securities) representing more than 20% or more of the equity or voting
power of UTC (or the resulting company), (2) a merger, consolidation, share
exchange or similar transaction pursuant to which any  UTC Third Party
acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, assets or businesses of UTC
RemainCo or any of its subsidiaries representing more than 20% or more of the
revenues, net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of  UTC
RemainCo and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, (3) any transaction pursuant
to which any UTC Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly or
indirectly, control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding
equity securities of  subsidiaries of UTC RemainCo and any entity surviving
any merger or combination including any of them) of UTC RemainCo or any of its
subsidiaries representing more than 20% or more of the revenues, net income or
assets (in each case on a  consolidated basis) of UTC RemainCo and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole or (4) any disposition of assets of UTC RemainCo
or its subsidiaries to a UTC Third Party representing more than 20% or more of
the revenues, net income or assets (in each  case on a consolidated basis) of
UTC RemainCo and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. For purposes of this
Agreement, an " _UTC Superior Proposal_ "  means any bona fide written
proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended or
modified) made by a UTC Third Party to enter into a UTC Alternative
Transaction (with all references to 20% in the definition of UTC Alternative 
Transaction being treated as references to 50% for these purposes) that (A)
did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.3(a)_ , (B) is on terms  that
the Board of Directors of UTC determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel) to be superior
from a financial point of view to UTC's stockholders than the transactions
contemplated  by this Agreement, taking into account all relevant factors
(including any changes to this Agreement that may be proposed by Raytheon in
response to such proposal to enter into a UTC Alternative Transaction and the
identity of the person making  such proposal to enter into a UTC Alternative
Transaction) and (C) is reasonably likely to be completed in accordance with
its terms, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other
aspects of such proposal, and is not subject to a  diligence or financing
condition.

 


 

 

(b) Except as permitted by this  _Section 5.3(b)_ or _Section 5.3(d)_ ,
neither the  Board of Directors of UTC nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or
modify, or fail to make, in each case in a manner adverse to Raytheon, the
approval or recommendation by such  Board of Directors or such committee of
the Merger or this Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly
to approve or recommend, any UTC Alternative Transaction, (iii) fail to
include in the Joint Proxy Statement the recommendation  of the Board of
Directors of UTC in favor of this Agreement and the UTC Share Issuance, (iv)

commencement of a tender or exchange offer relating to shares of UTC Common 
Stock (or, if earlier, at least two (2) business days prior to the UTC
Stockholders Meeting), a statement disclosing that UTC recommends rejection of
such tender or exchange offer and reaffirming its

 

 

-56-  

recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger or (v) fail to publicly
reaffirm its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger within ten (10)
business  days of Raytheon's written request to do so (or, if earlier, at
least two (2) business days prior to the UTC Stockholders' Meeting) following
the public announcement of any UTC Alternative Transaction (or any material
amendment, including any  change to the price or form of consideration);
_provided_ , that Raytheon shall not be entitled to make such written request,
and the Board of  Directors of UTC shall not be required to make such
reaffirmation, more than once with respect to any particular UTC Alternative
Transaction (or any material amendment thereto, including any change to the
price or form of consideration) (any action or failure to act in clauses (i)
through (v) being referred to as a " _UTC   Recommendation Change_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, prior to obtaining the UTC
Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of UTC determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside financial  advisors and outside legal
counsel, that it has received a UTC Superior Proposal that was not solicited,
initiated, knowingly encouraged or facilitated or otherwise procured in
violation of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of UTC may effect  a UTC
Recommendation Change (other than under clause (ii) of this _Section 5.3(b)_ )
if (A) the Board of Directors of UTC determines in good faith,  after
consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law, (B) UTC has notified Raytheon in writing that it
intends  to effect a UTC Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section
5.3(b)_ (other than under clause (ii) of this _Section   5.3(b)_ ), (C) UTC
has provided Raytheon with a copy of the proposed definitive agreements and
other proposed transaction documentation between UTC and the person making
such UTC Superior Proposal, and the identity of the person  making such UTC
Superior Proposal, (D) for a period of four (4) business days following the
notice delivered pursuant to clause (B) of this _Section 5.3(b)_ , UTC shall
have discussed and negotiated in  good faith and made UTC's Representatives
available to discuss and negotiate in good faith (in each case to the extent
Raytheon desires to negotiate) with Raytheon's Representatives any proposed
modifications to the terms and conditions of this  Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement so that the failure to take such
action would no longer be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law of the Board of Directors of UTC (it being understood and
agreed  that any amendment to any material term or condition of any UTC
Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new negotiation period that
shall expire on the later to occur of (I) two (2) business days following
delivery of such new notice  from UTC to Raytheon and (II) the expiration of
the original four (4)-business day period described in clause (D) above), and
(E) no earlier than the end of such negotiation period, the Board of Directors
of UTC shall have determined in good  faith, after consultation with its
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and after considering
the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, that
(x) the UTC Alternative Transaction that is the subject of  the notice
described in clause (B) above still constitutes a UTC Superior Proposal and
(y) the failure to take such action would still be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. Neither the Board of Directors of UTC
nor any  committee thereof shall cause or permit UTC or any of its controlled
affiliates to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other agreement related to any UTC Alternative
Transaction or requiring, or  reasonably likely to cause, UTC to terminate,
delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise impede, interfere with or
be inconsistent with, the consummation of the Merger (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 5.3(a)_ ).

 


 

 

 

-57-  

(c) In addition to the  obligations of UTC set forth in _Section 5.3(a)_ and
_Section             5.3(b)_ , UTC shall promptly, and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt thereof, advise Raytheon orally
and in writing of any request for information or proposal relating to a UTC
Alternative Transaction, the material  terms and conditions of such request
or proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person
making such request or proposal. UTC shall (i) keep Raytheon reasonably
informed of the status and details (including amendments or  proposed
amendments) of any such request or proposal on a reasonably current basis and
(ii) provide to Raytheon as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt or
delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other written materials
exchanged  between UTC or its subsidiaries or any of their Representatives,
on the one hand, and any person making such request or proposal or any of its
Representatives, on the other hand, in each case that describes or contains
any such request or  proposal.

 


 

 

(d) Other  than in connection with a UTC Superior Proposal (which shall be
subject to _Section 5.3(b)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section 5.3(d)_
), prior to obtaining the UTC Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of
UTC may, in response to a UTC Intervening Event, take any  action prohibited
by clauses (i) or (iii) of _Section 5.3(b)_ , only if (i) the Board of
Directors of UTC determines in good faith, after  consultation with its
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law, (ii) UTC has notified Raytheon in writing that it intends to  effect
such a UTC Recommendation Change (under clauses (i) or (iii) of _Section
5.3(b)_ ) pursuant to this _Section 5.3(d)_ (which notice shall specify the
facts and circumstances providing the basis of the UTC Intervening Event and
for the determination by the Board of Directors of  UTC to effect a UTC
Recommendation Change under clauses (i) or (iii) of _Section 5.3(b)_ in
reasonable detail), (iii) for a period of four (4)  business days following
the notice delivered pursuant to clause (ii) of this _Section 5.3(d)_ , UTC
shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith  and made UTC's
Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good faith (in each case
to the extent Raytheon desires to negotiate) with Raytheon's Representatives
any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or 
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so that the failure to take
such action would no longer be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law of the Board of Directors of UTC (it being understood and
agreed that any  material change to the relevant facts and circumstances
shall require a new notice and a new negotiation period that shall expire on
the later to occur of (A) two (2) business days following delivery of such new
notice from UTC to Raytheon and  (B) the expiration of the original four
(4)-business day period described above in this clause (iii)), and (iv) no
earlier than the end of such negotiation period, the Board of Directors of UTC
shall have determined in good faith, after  consultation with its outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and after considering the terms
of any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, that the failure
to take such action would still be inconsistent with its  fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law. The term " _UTC Intervening Event_ " means a material
event or circumstance that was not known or reasonably  foreseeable to the
Board of Directors of UTC on the date of this Agreement (or if known or
reasonably foreseeable, the consequences of which were not known or reasonably
foreseeable to the Board of Directors of UTC of the date of this Agreement), 
which event or circumstance, or any consequence thereof, becomes known to the
Board of Directors of UTC prior to the UTC Stockholder Approval; _provided_
,  that (1) in no event shall any inquiry, offer or proposal that constitutes
or would reasonably be expected to lead to a UTC Alternative Transaction
constitute a UTC

 

 

-58-  


  Intervening Event and (2) in no event shall any change in and of itself in
the market price or trading volume of the securities of Raytheon constitute a
UTC Intervening Event (it being understood that the facts or occurrences
giving rise or  contributing to such change may constitute or be taken into
account in determining whether there has been a UTC Intervening Event).

 


 

 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit UTC from taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under  the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look
and listen" statement or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position
thereunder; _provided_ that any such disclosure or statement that constitutes
or contains a UTC Recommendation Change shall be subject to the provisions of
_Section 5.3(b)_.

UTC shall prepare the Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement shall be
included as a prospectus, and  UTC shall file the Form S-4 with the SEC, and
(ii) UTC shall cause each of Carrier SpinCo and Otis SpinCo to prepare and

effected in compliance with Staff Legal Bulletin No. 4 issued by the SEC) or
on Form S-1 (if the conditions described in Staff Legal Bulletin No. 4 issued
by the SEC are not expected to be satisfied or if UTC  otherwise so
determines in response to the request or requirement of the SEC), in each case
to register under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as applicable, the
common stock to be distributed in each of the Distributions (together with 
any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _SpinCo Registration Statements_
"). Each of Raytheon and UTC shall use reasonable best efforts to have  the
Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing. Raytheon and UTC shall, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other party copies of any
written comments and advise  the other party of any oral comments, with
respect to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement received from the SEC.
UTC and Raytheon shall cooperate and provide the other parties with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any  amendment or supplement
to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement prior to filing such with the
SEC. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no amendment
or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the Form  S-4 or
the Joint Proxy Statement shall be made without the approval of both Raytheon
and UTC, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; _provided_ that, with respect to documents filed by a party that are
incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, this
right of approval shall apply only with respect to  information relating to
the other party or its business, financial condition or results of operations,
or the combined entity; and _provided_ , _further_ , that this approval right
shall not apply with respect to information relating to a Raytheon
Recommendation Change or a UTC Recommendation

Statement to be mailed to Raytheon's stockholders, and  UTC shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to
UTC's stockholders, in each case as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4
is declared effective under the Securities Act. Each party shall advise the 
other parties, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when

effective, of the time when any supplement or amendment to the Form S-4 has
been filed, of the  issuance of any stop order with respect to the Form S-4
or either SpinCo Registration Statement, or of any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement or comments on the Form
S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement and  responses thereto or requests by the
SEC for additional information relating thereto. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any information relating to Raytheon, UTC or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be  discovered by
Raytheon or UTC that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any
of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement so that any such document would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material  fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party and an
appropriate amendment or supplement  describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Applicable Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of Raytheon and UTC.

in accordance with the DGCL and the rules of the NYSE for the purpose of
obtaining the Raytheon Stockholder Approval and shall, subject to the
provisions of _Section 5.2(b)_ , through its Board of Directors, recommend to
its stockholders the adoption of this Agreement. Raytheon may only postpone or
adjourn  the Raytheon Stockholders Meeting (i) to solicit additional proxies
for the purpose of obtaining the Raytheon Stockholder Approval, (ii) for the
absence of a quorum and (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing and/or mailing of  any supplemental or amended disclosure that
Raytheon has determined after consultation with outside legal counsel is
reasonably likely to be required under Applicable Law and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and  reviewed by
stockholders of Raytheon prior to the Raytheon Stockholders Meeting;
_provided_ that Raytheon shall postpone or adjourn the Raytheon  Stockholders
Meeting up to two (2) times for up to thirty (30) days each time upon the
reasonable request of UTC.

 


 

 

(c) UTC shall,  as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared

Meeting and the UTC Stockholders Meeting are (i) the Merger, in the case of
the Raytheon Stockholders Meeting, and the UTC Share Issuance, in the case of
the UTC Stockholders Meeting,  (ii) any adjournment or postponement of the
Raytheon Stockholders Meeting or the UTC Stockholders Meeting, as applicable,

Confidentiality Agreement and subject to Applicable Law, and solely for the
purposes of furthering the  Merger, upon reasonable notice, Raytheon shall,

officers, employees and Representatives of such other  party, reasonable
access, during normal business hours during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, to all of its and their respective
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records ( _provided_
  that such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or
operations of such party), and during such period, Raytheon shall, and shall
cause its subsidiaries to, and UTC shall, and shall cause the subsidiaries of
UTC RemainCo to,  furnish promptly to the other party all information
concerning its and their business, properties and personnel as such other
party may reasonably request; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not require
Raytheon or UTC to disclose any  information pursuant to this _Section 6.2_
to the extent that (i) in the reasonable good faith judgment of such party,
any Applicable Law requires such party or its subsidiaries to restrict or 
prohibit access to any such information, (ii) in the reasonable good faith
judgment of such party, the information is subject to confidentiality
obligations to a third party or (iii) disclosure of any such information or
document would result  in the loss of attorney-client privilege, attorney
work product or other relevant legal privilege; _provided_ , _further_ , that,
with respect to the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), Raytheon or UTC, as
applicable, shall use its  commercially reasonable efforts to (A) obtain the
required consent of any third party necessary to provide such disclosure, (B)
develop an alternative to providing such information so as to address such
matters that is reasonably acceptable to the other party and (C) utilize the
procedures of a joint defense agreement or implement such other techniques if
the parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of
such information without violating Applicable  Law or jeopardizing such
privilege. No review pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ shall affect any
representation or warranty given by the other party hereto. Any information
provided or made available pursuant to this _Section 6.2_   shall be governed
by the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.2_ , UTC and its subsidiaries
shall have no obligation  under, and shall not be required to afford access
or furnish information pursuant to, this _Section 6.2_ in respect of the
Separation or the Distributions, to which this _Section 6.2_ shall not apply,
it being understood that UTC's obligations in respect of access to information
relating to the Separation and the Distributions are governed by _Section 6.8_
and _Section 6.16_ (including  Section 6.16 of the UTC Disclosure Letter).

businesses or product lines of UTC RemainCo or any of its affiliates or any
assets, properties, businesses or product lines of Raytheon or any of its 
affiliates (individually or collectively " _Remedial Actions_ ") and (ii) in
the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other decree, order,
judgment, writ, stipulation, award or temporary restraining order (an "
_Order_ ") in any Action by or with any Governmental Entity is entered or
becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered that would make consummation of
the Merger unlawful or that would otherwise prevent or delay consummation of
the Merger, taking any and all steps (including the posting of a bond,
commencement,  contesting and defending of any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the
taking of the steps contemplated  by clause (i) above) necessary to vacate,
modify or suspend such Order; _provided_ that no party shall be required
pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ to commit to or effect any Remedial Action that
is not conditioned upon the consummation of  the Merger. Raytheon and UTC
shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other and work in
good faith to develop the strategy relating to any Remedial Actions and in
connection with the process of effecting (including negotiating  or
committing to effect) any Remedial Actions, including any divestiture process
and any communications with potential divestiture buyers relating thereto.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no party is
required to  commit to or effect any sale, divestiture, lease, holding
separate pending a sale or other transfer or disposal, or any other
restriction or action contemplated by this _Section 6.3(d)_ if such actions,
in the aggregate would or would reasonably be expected to have a materially
adverse  impact on Raytheon, UTC or their respective subsidiaries or
affiliates, in each case measured on a scale relative to the size of UTC
RemainCo and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (after giving effect to the
Merger) (an " _Unacceptable Condition_ ").

 


 

 

(e) Each of the parties agrees that, between the date of this Agreement and
the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 8.1_ , it shall not, and shall ensure that none of
its  subsidiaries shall, consummate, enter into any agreement providing for,
or announce, any investment, acquisition, divestiture or other business
combination that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent
the consummation of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 


 

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.3_ , UTC and
its subsidiaries shall have no obligation under, and shall not be required to
commit to or effect any action pursuant to, this _Section 6.3_ in respect of
the Separation or the Distributions  (including in relation to UTC's IRS
private letter ruling request with respect to the Distributions and certain
related transactions, as amended or supplemented), to which this _Section 6.3_
shall not apply, it being understood that UTC's obligations in respect of the
Separation and the  Distributions are governed by _Section 6.8_ and _Section
6.16_.

 


 

 

 

Section 6.4. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

 


 

 

 

-64-  

(a) UTC agrees that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities, including advancement of expenses, for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the  Effective Time now existing in favor of the
current or former directors or officers of Raytheon (the " _D andO Indemnified
Parties_") as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation of Raytheon, the
Bylaws of Raytheon or any  indemnification contract between such directors or
officers and Raytheon (in each case, as in effect on, and, in the case of any
indemnification contracts, to the extent made available to UTC prior to, the
date of this Agreement) shall survive  the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect. For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and UTC  shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses equivalent to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation of
Raytheon and the Bylaws of Raytheon as in effect  immediately prior to the
Effective Time with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder 
of any DandO Indemnified Parties; _provided_ that all rights to indemnification
in respect of any claim made for indemnification within such period shall
continue until the disposition of such action or resolution of such claim.
From  and after the Effective Time, UTC shall guarantee and stand surety for,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their
respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this _Section 6.4_.

 


 

 

(b) Prior to  the Effective Time, Raytheon shall or, if Raytheon is unable
to, UTC shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of or after the Effective
Time to, purchase a six (6)-year prepaid "tail" policy, with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of  liability that are no less favorable
than the coverage provided under Raytheon's existing policies of directors'
and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance, with
respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time  (including in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions or actions contemplated by
this Agreement), and UTC shall cause such policy to be maintained in full
force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to
be  honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any
further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder; _provided_  
that Raytheon shall not pay, and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
required to pay, in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by Raytheon
prior to the date of this Agreement in respect of such "tail" policy. If
Raytheon or the  Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies prior to, as of or after the Effective Time, UTC
shall, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in  effect the current policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by Raytheon with respect to matters arising on or before the
Effective Time; _provided_ that, after the Effective Time, UTC shall not be
required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium
paid by Raytheon prior to the date of this Agreement  in respect of the
coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall
purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount.

 


 

 

(c) The  covenants contained in this _Section 6.4_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified  Parties
and their respective heirs and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which any such person is entitled, whether pursuant to Applicable
Law, contract or otherwise.

 


 

 

 

-65-  

(d) In the  event that UTC or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger  or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors or
assigns of UTC or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may  be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.4_.

 


 

 

Section 6.5. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as set forth in this _Section 6.5_
and in _Section 8.2_ , all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or  expenses, whether or not
the Merger is consummated, except that each of UTC and Raytheon shall bear and
pay one-half of the costs and expenses (other than the fees and expenses of
each party's attorneys and accountants, which shall be borne by  the party
incurring such expenses) incurred by the parties in connection with (a) the
filing, printing and mailing of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement
(including SEC filing fees) and (b) the filings of the premerger notification
and report forms under the HSR Act and similar laws of  other jurisdictions
(including filing fees).

 


 

 

Section 6.6. _Public Announcements_. Raytheon and UTC shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or making any public statement with
respect to this  Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (in the
case of UTC, other than the Separation and the Distributions) and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the
prior consent of the other, such  consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the first sentence of
this _Section 6.6_ shall not apply to (a) any press release or public
statement required  by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange, _provided_ that the party making the release or
statement has used its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other
party, (b) a Raytheon Recommendation Change (or any responses thereto) or UTC
Recommendation Change (or any responses thereto), or the proviso in _Section
5.2(b)_ and _  Section 5.3(b)_ (or any response to a statement made pursuant
to _Section 5.2(b)_ and _Section 5.3(b))_ , (c) any disclosure of 
information concerning this Agreement in connection with any dispute between
the parties regarding this Agreement and (d) any press release or public 
statement containing content with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby substantially consistent with content
included in any press release or public statement that has been previously
consented to by the other party  or otherwise exempted from this _Section
6.6_.

 


 

 

Section 6.7. _NYSE Listing_. Raytheon and UTC shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the UTC Common Stock issuable under _Article III_ to be
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, 
prior to the Closing Date.

 


 

 

Section 6.8. _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

_ 
  _

 

(a) _Efforts_. From and after the date of this Agreement and until the
Effective Time, each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cause  each of the External Separation Transactions, the Merger and the
Specified Internal Restructuring Transactions to qualify for its Intended Tax-
Free Treatment and (ii) not knowingly take any action, cause or

 

 

-66-  

permit any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to
fail to be taken, which action or failure to act could  reasonably be
expected to prevent the External Separation Transactions, the Merger or any
Specified Internal Restructuring Transaction from qualifying for its Intended
Tax-Free Treatment.

 


 

 

(b) _External Spin-Off Tax Opinion_. From and after the date of this Agreement
and until the Effective Time, Raytheon shall cooperate with UTC, and UTC and 
Raytheon shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to facilitate
receipt by UTC of the External Spin-Off Tax Opinion from Wachtell, Lipton,
Rosen and Katz (or other nationally recognized tax counsel reasonably acceptable
to UTC and  Raytheon) (" _UTC Tax Counsel_ "). Such opinion shall be issued
on the basis of customary representations, assumptions (including the accuracy
of the  IRS Ruling Request, as amended or supplemented through the date of
such opinion, and the accuracy and continuing validity of the IRS Ruling) and
undertakings set forth or referred to in such opinion and in the related
External Spin-Off Tax  Representation Letters. UTC shall (and shall cause
Otis SpinCo and Carrier SpinCo to) deliver to UTC Tax Counsel for purposes of
the External Spin-Off Tax Opinion customary representations, assumptions and
undertakings, reasonably satisfactory  in form and substance to UTC Tax
Counsel (the " _External Spin-Off Tax Representation Letters_ "). UTC will
promptly notify Raytheon if, before the  Effective Time, it knows or has
reason to believe that UTC is no longer able to obtain the External Spin-Off
Tax Opinion or if the terms of this Agreement (including the Separation
Principles) would need to be amended in order to facilitate  receipt of such
opinion.

 


 

 

(c) _IRS Ruling_. UTC has submitted to the IRS the IRS Ruling Request, and UTC
shall prepare and submit to the IRS supplemental materials relating thereto 
that UTC determines (after giving Raytheon the opportunity to consult thereon
and considering any Raytheon comments) are necessary or appropriate to obtain
the requested rulings under the IRS Ruling Request or any additional rulings
from the IRS,  including additional rulings regarding Section 355, if any, as
a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each, an " _IRS
Submission_ ").              From and after the date of this
Agreement and until the Effective Time, each party hereto agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to facilitate receipt by UTC of the IRS Ruling,
including providing such appropriate information as the IRS shall  require in
connection with the IRS Ruling Request or any IRS Submission. In connection
with the IRS Ruling Request, UTC shall (i) keep Raytheon informed of all
material actions taken or proposed to be taken by UTC or the IRS, (ii)
reasonably in  advance of any material IRS Submission, provide Raytheon with
a reasonable opportunity to review, discuss and comment on each such IRS
Submission, and consider in good faith Raytheon's comments on such draft to
the extent such comments are timely  provided, (iii) provide Raytheon with
copies of any material written communications received from the IRS with
respect to the IRS Ruling Request, including with respect to any IRS
Submission and (iv) keep Raytheon promptly and reasonably informed 
concerning any material communications (however conducted) with the IRS
concerning the IRS Ruling Request or any IRS Submission. If the IRS notifies
UTC that it will not issue the IRS Ruling (or will not issue any ruling
requested in the IRS  Ruling Request or an IRS Submission (other than any
Internal Restructuring Tax Opinions/Rulings)), then, during the ensuing thirty
(30)-day period, the parties will collaborate in good faith to identify
possible alternatives (including  alternative structures and seeking
additional Tax opinions) that the parties determine, with the assistance of
their respective tax advisors, will either make likely the receipt of the IRS
Ruling (or such ruling) or eliminate the necessity for a  ruling, in either
case, without (A)

 


 

 

 

-67-  

materially affecting the value of the transactions contemplated hereby to UTC
or Raytheon, (B) substantially increasing the regulatory  or other consents
or approvals required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or by
the Separation Documentation, or (C) otherwise resulting in any substantial
impediment to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or  by
the Separation Documentation; _provided_ , that the parties shall not be
required to effectuate any alternative structures or transactions or seek 
any additional Tax opinions pursuant to this sentence in the event that such
failure by the IRS to issue such ruling or rulings would not reasonably be
expected to result in tax liabilities of UTC RemainCo in excess of
$400,000,000 in the  aggregate (taking into account all rulings not issued by
the IRS). In the event that the parties agree to effectuate such an
alternative, they shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, modify the
covenants and agreements set forth in this  Agreement and/or the Separation
Documentation to the extent necessary to reflect such alternative. In
furtherance of the foregoing, to the extent necessary to reflect any such
alternative, UTC shall submit one or more IRS Submissions to modify  the IRS
Ruling Request.

 


 

 

(d) _Merger Tax Opinions_. From and after the date of this Agreement and until
the Effective Time, Raytheon, on the one hand, and UTC, on the other hand, 
shall cooperate with each other and shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to obtain, a written opinion of Shearman and Sterling LLP (or other
nationally recognized tax counsel reasonably acceptable to Raytheon and UTC)
(" _Raytheon Tax Counsel_ "), in the case of Raytheon, and a written opinion
of UTC Tax Counsel, in the case of UTC, in form and substance reasonably 
satisfactory to Raytheon and UTC, respectively (each such opinion, a " _Merger
Tax Opinion_ "), dated as of the Closing Date, (A) to the effect that,  on
the basis of customary representations, assumptions (including the accuracy of
the IRS Ruling Request, as it may be amended or supplemented through the date
of such opinion, and the accuracy and continuing validity of the IRS Ruling)
and  undertakings set forth or referred to in such opinion and in the related
Merger Tax Representation Letters, (i) the Merger will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and (ii)
the Merger will not cause  Section 355(e) of the Code to apply to either
Distribution, and (B) addressing any supplemental matter reasonably requested
by both Raytheon and UTC to be included in such opinion. Each of Raytheon,
UTC, and Merger Sub shall deliver to Raytheon  Tax Counsel and UTC Tax
Counsel for purposes of the Merger Tax Opinions customary representations,
assumptions and undertakings, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to
Raytheon Tax Counsel and UTC Tax Counsel (the " _Merger Tax Representation
Letters_ "). In rendering the Merger Tax Opinion, UTC Tax Counsel and Raytheon
Tax Counsel may assume that the External  Separation Transactions qualified
for their Intended Tax-Free Treatment and would continue to so qualify if the
Merger did not occur. Raytheon will promptly notify UTC if, before the
Effective Time, (A) it knows or has reason to believe that  Raytheon is no
longer able to obtain the Merger Tax Opinion from Raytheon Tax Counsel, or (B)
the terms of this Agreement (including the Separation Principles) would need
to be amended in order to facilitate receipt of such opinion. UTC will 
promptly notify Raytheon if, before the Effective Time, (A) it knows or has
reason to believe that UTC is no longer able to obtain the Merger Tax Opinion
from UTC Tax Counsel, including as a result of the failure of any UTC Common
Stock to be  Qualified UTC Common Stock, or (B) the terms of this Agreement
(including the Separation Principles) would need to be amended in order to
facilitate receipt of such opinion.

 


 

 

 

-68-  

(e) _Internal Restructuring Transactions_. From and after the date of this
Agreement and until the Effective Time, Raytheon shall cooperate with UTC,
and  UTC and Raytheon shall use their respective reasonable best efforts, to
facilitate receipt by UTC of the Internal Restructuring Tax Opinions/Rulings.
If any of the Internal Restructuring Tax Opinions/Rulings are not timely
obtained, then  notwithstanding anything herein or in the Separation
Principles to the contrary, the Step Plan may be altered by UTC in a manner
that is reasonably consistent with the overall tax planning for the Separation
and the Distributions; _provided_ , that, no such modification or
modifications that would reasonably be expected to result in incremental costs
to UTC RemainCo in excess of  $500,000,000 in the aggregate may be made
without Raytheon's prior consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

 


 

 

Section 6.9. _Takeover Statutes_. If any antitakeover or similar statute or
regulation is or may become applicable to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, each  of the parties hereto and its respective Board of
Directors shall (a) grant such approvals and take all such actions as are
legally permissible so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be 
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
(b) otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such statute or
regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

 


 

 

Section 6.10. _Conveyance Taxes_. Raytheon and UTC shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires,
applications or other  documents regarding any real property transfer or
gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees or any similar Taxes which
become payable in connection with the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the
Effective Time.

 


 

 

Section 6.11. _Employee Benefits_.

 

_ 
  _

 

(a) In order  to further an orderly transition and integration, Raytheon and
UTC shall cooperate in good faith in reviewing, evaluating and analyzing the
UTC RemainCo Benefit Plans and Raytheon Benefit Plans with a view towards
developing appropriate new  benefit plans, or selecting the UTC RemainCo
Benefit Plans or Raytheon Benefit Plans, as applicable, that will apply with
respect to employees of UTC RemainCo and its subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) after  the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _New Benefit Plans_ "), which New Benefit Plans will, to
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, and among  other things, (i) treat
similarly situated employees on a substantially equivalent basis, taking into
account all relevant factors, including duties, geographic location, tenure,
qualifications and abilities, and (ii) not discriminate between  employees
who were covered by UTC RemainCo Benefit Plans, on the one hand, and those
covered by Raytheon Benefit Plans, on the other hand, at the Effective Time.

 


 

 

(b) For  purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and benefit accrual
(except (i) for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension
plan, (ii) to the extent that such credit would result in a duplication of
benefits, or (iii) under  any plan that is grandfathered or frozen) under the
UTC RemainCo Benefit Plans, Raytheon Benefit Plans and the New Benefit Plans,
service with or credited by UTC RemainCo, Raytheon or any of their respective
subsidiaries or predecessors for  continuing employees of Raytheon and its
subsidiaries

 


 

 

 

-69-  

or continuing employees of UTC RemainCo or its subsidiaries shall be treated
as service with UTC RemainCo to the same extent that such  service was taken
into account under the analogous Raytheon Benefit Plan or UTC RemainCo Benefit
Plan prior to the Effective Time. With respect to any Raytheon Benefit Plan,
UTC RemainCo Benefit Plan or New Benefit Plan in which any employees of  UTC
RemainCo or Raytheon (or their subsidiaries) prior to the Effective Time first
become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, and in which
such employees did not participate prior to the Effective Time, UTC RemainCo
shall:   (i) waive all preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such
employees and their eligible dependents, except to the extent such pre-
existing conditions, exclusions  or waiting periods would apply under the
analogous UTC RemainCo Benefit Plan or Raytheon Benefit Plan, as the case may
be, and (ii) provide each such employee and his or her eligible dependents
with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid  prior to the Effective
Time (or, if later, prior to the time such employee commenced participation in
the New Benefit Plan) under a UTC RemainCo Benefit Plan or Raytheon Benefit
Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under the  analogous
Raytheon or UTC RemainCo Benefit Plan) in satisfying any applicable deductible
or out-of-pocket requirements under any Raytheon Benefit Plan, UTC RemainCo
Benefit Plan or New Benefit Plan in which such employee first become eligible
to  participate after the Effective Time.

 


 

 

(c) Nothing  in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of UTC or Raytheon or any of their subsidiaries or
affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving
Corporation, Raytheon, UTC or any  subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation,
Raytheon, UTC or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate
the services of any employee, officer,  director or consultant of UTC or
Raytheon or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Raytheon Benefit  Plan, UTC RemainCo
Benefit Plan, New Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to amend,
modify  or terminate any particular Raytheon Benefit Plan, UTC RemainCo
Benefit Plan, New Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting
the generality of _Section 9.6_ , nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person, including any current
or former employee,  officer, director or consultant of UTC or Raytheon or
any of their subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

as are reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and any  other dispositions of equity securities of Raytheon
(including derivative securities) or acquisitions of equity securities of UTC
(including derivative securities) in connection herewith by any individual who
(a) is a director or officer of Raytheon or (b) at the Effective Time will
become a  director or officer of UTC, in each case to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 


 

 

 

Section 6.13. _Dividends_.

 

 


 

 

 

-70-  

(a) Each of  Raytheon and UTC shall coordinate with the other in respect of
the designation of the record dates and payment dates for its quarterly cash
dividends, so that holders of shares of Raytheon Common Stock do not (a)
receive dividends on both shares  of Raytheon Common Stock and UTC Common
Stock received in the Merger in respect of any calendar quarter or (b) fail to
receive a dividend on either shares of Raytheon Common Stock or UTC Common
Stock received in the Merger in respect of any  calendar quarter (in the case
of this clause (b), unless UTC shall not pay a dividend on any shares of UTC
Common Stock in respect of such quarter).

 


 

 

(b)

 


 

 

(i) On or prior to the date that is ten (10) business days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, UTC may, if it determines in good faith that (A) the
Applicable Indebtedness (as defined in the Separation Principles) is 
reasonably expected to exceed the Target Indebtedness (the amount of such
excess, the " _Overage Amount_ ") and (B) the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of total indebtedness for borrowed money of  Otis SpinCo, Carrier
SpinCo and their respective subsidiaries as of immediately following the
consummation of the Otis Distribution (in the case of Otis SpinCo) and the
Carrier Distribution (in the case of Carrier SpinCo) would exceed 
$18,250,000,000, deliver written notice (the " _Overage Notice_ ") of such
determinations to Raytheon, which such notice shall also set forth the 
Overage Amount.

 


 

 

(ii) In the event that UTC delivers an Overage Notice, (A) Raytheon may, in
its sole discretion, declare (with a record date prior to the Closing) and pay
to its stockholders (whether before or after the Closing, while  minimizing
any delay in the Closing to the extent reasonably practicable) a cash
distribution in an aggregate amount equal to the product of (1) a fraction,
the numerator of which is 0.43 and the denominator of which is 0.57, and (2)
the Overage  Amount, and (B) subject to clause (II) below, whether or not
Raytheon elects to pay such a cash distribution, Target Indebtedness shall be
deemed for purposes of this Agreement (including the Separation Principles) to
be increased by the Overage  Amount; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event the amount of the cash distribution calculated in
accordance with this _Section 6.13(b)(ii)_ would (x) be $250,000,000 or less,
UTC may, in its discretion, withdraw the Overage Notice and no provision of
this _Section 6.13(b)(ii)_ shall be given effect; _provided_ ,  that if UTC
does not withdraw the Overage Notice, then (I) Raytheon shall be permitted to
pay a cash distribution pursuant to this _Section 6.13(b)(ii)_   in an
aggregate amount of $250,000,000 and (II) whether or not Raytheon elects to
pay such a cash distribution, in lieu of the foregoing clause (B), the Target
Indebtedness shall be deemed for purposes of this Agreement (including the
Separation  Principles) to be increased by $331,000,000, or (y) exceed
$2,000,000,000, no provision of this _Section 6.13(b)(ii)_ shall be given
effect.

 


 

 

Section 6.14. _Certain Litigation_. Each party shall promptly advise the other
of any litigation commenced after the date hereof against such party or any of
its directors  or officers (in their capacity as such) by any stockholders of
such party (on their own behalf or on behalf of such party) relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall keep the other
parties reasonably informed  regarding any such litigation. Such party shall
give the

 


 

 

 

-71-  

other parties the opportunity to participate in  the defense or settlement of
any such stockholder litigation, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without the other party's prior consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 


 

 

Section 6.15. _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Raytheon shall use its reasonable best efforts to facilitate
the commencement of the  delisting of Raytheon and of the shares of Raytheon
Common Stock from the NYSE as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time. Prior to the Effective Time, Raytheon shall not voluntarily delist the
Raytheon Common Stock from the NYSE.

 


 

 

Section 6.16. _Separation and Distributions_.

 


 

 

(a) Following  the execution of this Agreement, UTC shall prepare the
Separation Documentation to effect the Separation and the Distributions in
accordance with the Separation Principles and otherwise on terms that are
customary for similar agreements. Subject  to the limitations set forth in

shall provide drafts of the Separation Documentation to  Raytheon and its
Representatives reasonably in advance of filing forms of the Separation
Documentation with the SpinCo Registration Statements, shall make its
applicable employees, representatives and advisors available to Raytheon's 
Representatives a reasonable number of times upon reasonable prior notice (and
during normal business hours) for purposes of discussing the draft Separation

Representatives to such documents. Prior to the Distributions, UTC and its
applicable subsidiaries shall enter into the Separation Documentation, in each
case in form and substance consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
including the  Separation Principles.

 


 

 

(b) Promptly  following the date of this Agreement, each of Raytheon and UTC

each party may change or replace its designees serving on the Separation
Committee from time to time with written notice to the other party), which
shall meet no less frequently than bi-weekly (and more frequently upon 
Raytheon's reasonable request) for the purposes of (i) reviewing and
discussing cooperatively and in good faith the status of the Separation and
the Distributions, including the status of the SpinCo Registration Statements,
the Separation  Documentation and the Pre-Merger Financing Transactions, and
(ii) reviewing and discussing cooperatively and in good faith the status of
the Step Plan and any proposed modifications thereto.

 


 

 

(c) UTC shall  consummate the Separation and each Distribution in accordance
with this Agreement, including the Separation Principles, and the Separation

requirements of Applicable Law  and the rules and regulations of the NYSE),
but in any event on or prior to the fourth business day prior to the Outside
Date (as such date may be extended pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ ;
_provided_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section
8.1(b)(i)_ , and without limiting any automatic extension or right of
extension provided for therein, in the event that the date upon which both of

Representations_. This Agreement (including the documents, exhibits,
schedules, disclosure letters and instruments referred to herein), taken
together with the Confidentiality Agreement and

 


 

 

 

-91-

  _

 

Section 9.9. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND  DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR  RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C)             IT

Section 9.10. _Specific Enforcement_. The parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were  not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall
be entitled to an  injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions
of this Agreement in any court referred to in _Section 9.11_ , without proof
of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this  being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in

 


 

 

 

-92-  

equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is  unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for
any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy for any such breach.

 


 

 

Section 9.11. _Jurisdiction_. In any action between the parties arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
each of the  parties (a) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State
of  Delaware in and for New Castle County, Delaware, (b) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such jurisdiction by motion or other request
for  leave from such court and (c) agrees that it will not bring any such
action in any court other than the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware
in  and for New Castle County, Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court
finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the federal court of the United
States of America sitting in Delaware, and appellate courts thereof, or, if
(and only if) each of  such Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware and
such federal court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court
within the State of Delaware. Service of process, summons, notice or document
to any party's address and in the  manner set forth in _Section 9.2_ shall be
effective  service of process for any such action.

 


 

 

Section 9.12. _Headings, etc._. The headings, table of contents and index of
defined terms contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect  in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 9.13. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all  other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to  any party or such party waives its rights under
this _Section 9.13_ with respect thereto. Upon a  determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as  possible to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

 

AS AMENDED AND RESTATED EFFECTIVE

 

[●], 20[●]

 


 

 

 

SECTION 1 - Meetings of Shareholders

 


 

 

SECTION 1.1 Annual Meetings.

 


 

 

Annual meetings of shareholders shall be held each year on such date and at
such time as may be fixed by the Board of  Directors for the purpose of
electing directors and transacting such other proper business as may come
before the meeting.

 


 

 

SECTION 1.2 Special Meetings.

 


 

 

(A) Special meetings of  shareholders may be called from time to time by the
Board of Directors, by the Chairman, by the Chief Executive Officer of the
Corporation or by the Secretary of the Corporation at the valid written
request of shareholders of record who own  (for all purposes under this
Section 1.2, as defined in Section 1.12(A)(3) of these Bylaws), or are acting
on behalf of one or more beneficial owners who own, capital stock representing
at least 15% of the Voting Stock (the "Special Meeting  Request Required
Shares"), and who continue to own the Special Meeting Request Required Shares
at all times between the Ownership Record Date (as defined in paragraph (B) of
this Section 1.2) and the date of the applicable meeting of  shareholders.
Special meetings shall be held solely for the purpose or purposes specified in
the notice of meeting delivered by the Corporation. For purposes of these
Bylaws, "Voting Stock" shall mean outstanding shares of capital stock of  the
Corporation entitled to vote generally for the election of directors.

 


 

 

(B) Any record shareholder  (whether acting for him, her or itself, or at the
direction of a beneficial owner) may, by written notice to the Secretary of
the Corporation, request that the Board of Directors fix a record date to
determine the record shareholders who are  entitled to deliver a written
request to call a special meeting (such record date, the "Ownership Record
Date"). A valid written request to fix an Ownership Record Date shall include
all of the information that must be included in a written  request to call a
special meeting, as set forth in paragraph (D) of this Section 1.2. The Board
of Directors may fix the Ownership Record Date within 10 days of the
Secretary's receipt of a valid written request to fix the Ownership Record 
Date. The Ownership Record Date shall not precede, and shall not be more than
10 days after, the date upon which the resolution fixing the Ownership Record
Date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If an Ownership Record Date is not
fixed  by the Board of Directors within the period set forth above, the
Ownership Record Date shall be the date that the first valid written request
to call a special meeting is received by the Secretary with respect to the
proposed business to be  submitted for shareholder approval at a special
meeting.

 


 

 

(C) A beneficial owner who  wishes to deliver a written request to call a
special meeting must cause the nominee or other person who serves as the
record shareholder of such beneficial owner's stock to sign the written
request to call a special meeting. If a record

 

 

A-1  

shareholder is the nominee for more than one beneficial owner of stock, the
record shareholder may deliver a valid written request to call  a special
meeting solely with respect to the capital stock of the Corporation
beneficially owned by the beneficial owner who is directing the record
shareholder to sign such written request to call a special meeting.

 


 

 

(D) Each valid written  request to call a special meeting shall include the
following and shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation:

 


 

 

(1) the  signature of the record shareholder submitting such request and the
date such request was signed;

 


 

 

(2) the  text of each business proposal desired to be submitted for
shareholder approval at the special meeting; and

 


 

 

(3) as  to the beneficial owner, if any, directing such record shareholder to
sign the written request to call a special meeting and as to such record
shareholder (unless such record shareholder is acting solely as a nominee for
a beneficial owner)  (each such beneficial owner and each record shareholder
who is not acting solely as a nominee, a "Disclosing Party"):

 


 

 

(a) all  of the information required to be disclosed pursuant to Section
1.10(A)(2) of these Bylaws, which information shall be supplemented (by
delivery to the Secretary) by each Disclosing Party (i) not later than 10 days
after the record date for  determining the record shareholders entitled to
notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting (such record date, the "Meeting
Record Date"), to disclose the foregoing information as of the Meeting Record
Date and (ii) not later than the 5th  day before the special meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, to disclose the foregoing information as
of the date that is 10 days prior to the special meeting or any such
adjournment or postponement thereof, as applicable;

 


 

 

(b) with             respect to each business proposal to be
submitted for shareholder approval at the special meeting, a statement whether
or not any Disclosing Party will deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy
to holders of at least the percentage of  voting power of all of the shares
of Voting Stock of the Corporation required under these Bylaws, the
certificate of incorporation and statute to carry such proposal (such
statement, a "Solicitation Statement"); and

 


 

 

(c) any  additional information reasonably requested by the Board of
Directors to verify the Voting Stock ownership position of such Disclosing
Party.

 


 

 

Each time the Disclosing Party's Voting Stock ownership position decreases
following the delivery of the foregoing  information to the Secretary, such
Disclosing Party shall notify the Corporation of his, her or its decreased
Voting Stock ownership position, together with any information reasonably
requested by the Board of Directors to verify such  position, within 10 days
of such decrease or as of the 5th day before the special meeting, whichever is
earlier.

 


 

 

 

A-2  

(E) The Secretary shall  not accept, and shall consider ineffective, an
otherwise valid written request to call a special meeting pursuant to Clause
(A) of this Section 1.2:

 


 

 

(1) that            does not comply with the provisions of this
Section 1.2;

 


 

 

(2) that             relates to an item of business that is not a
proper subject for shareholder action under applicable law;

 


 

 

(3) that            is delivered during the period commencing 90
days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the notice of annual
meeting for the immediately preceding annual meeting and ending on the date of
the next annual meeting;

 


 

 

(4) if  the Board of Directors has called or calls an annual or special
meeting of shareholders to be held not more than 90 days after receipt by the
Secretary of such written request to call a special meeting and the purpose of
such shareholder  meeting called by the Board of Directors includes (among
any other matters properly brought before the meeting) an identical or
substantially similar item (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors, a "Similar Item") as the  purpose specified in such written
request to call a special meeting; or

 


 

 

(5) if  a Similar Item (a) other than the election of directors, has been
presented at any meeting of shareholders held within 180 to 91 days prior to
receipt by the Secretary of such written request to call a special meeting or
(b) has been  presented at any meeting of shareholders held within 90 days
prior to receipt by the Secretary of such written request to call a special
meeting (and, for purposes of clarity, for purposes of this clause (b), the
election of directors shall  deemed to be a "Similar Item" with respect to
all items of business involving the election or removal of directors).

 


 

 

(F) Revocations:

 


 

 

(1) A  record shareholder may revoke a request to call a special meeting at
any time before the special meeting by sending written notice of such
revocation to the Secretary of the Corporation.

 


 

 

(2) All  written requests for a special meeting shall be deemed revoked:

 


 

 

(a) upon            the first date that, after giving effect to
revocation(s) and notice(s) of ownership position decrease(s) (pursuant to
Section 1.2(D)(3) and the last sentence of Section 1.2(D), respectively), the
aggregate Voting Stock ownership position of  all the Disclosing Parties who
are listed on the unrevoked valid written requests to call a special meeting
with respect to the applicable proposal decreases to a number of shares of
Voting Stock less than the Special Meeting Request Required  Shares;

 


 

 

(b) if  any Disclosing Party who has provided a Solicitation Statement with
respect to any business proposal to be submitted for shareholder approval at
such special meeting does not act in accordance with the representations set
forth therein; or

 


 

 

 

A-3  

(c) if  any Disclosing Party does not provide the information required by
Section 1.2(D) in accordance with such provisions.

 


 

 

(3) If  an actual or deemed revocation of all valid written requests to call
a special meeting has occurred after the special meeting has been called by
the Secretary, the Board of Directors shall have the discretion to determine
whether or not to  proceed with the special meeting.

 


 

 

(G) The Board of Directors  may submit its own proposal or proposals for
consideration at a special meeting called at the request of one or more
shareholders pursuant to this Section 1.2. The Meeting Record Date for, and
the place, date and time of, any special meeting  shall be fixed by the Board
of Directors; provided, that the date of any such special meeting shall not be
more than 120 days after the  date on which valid special meeting request(s)
from holder(s) of the Special Meeting Required Shares are delivered to the
Secretary of the Corporation in accordance with this Section 1.2.

 


 

 

SECTION 1.3 Time and Place of Meetings.

 


 

 

Subject to the provisions of Section 1.1 and Section 1.2, each meeting of
shareholders shall be held on such date, at  such hour and at such place as
fixed by the Board of Directors or in the notice of the meeting delivered by
the Corporation or, in the case of an adjourned meeting, as announced by the
Corporation at the meeting at which the adjournment is  taken.

 


 

 

SECTION 1.4 Notice of Meetings.

 


 

 

A notice of each meeting of shareholders, stating the place, date and hour of
the meeting and, in the case of a special  meeting, the purpose or purposes
for which the meeting is called, shall be given by the Corporation personally,
by mail or by electronic transmission as set forth below to each shareholder
entitled to vote at the meeting. Unless otherwise  provided by statute, the
notice shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date
of the meeting and, if mailed, shall be deposited in the United States mail,
postage prepaid, directed to the shareholder at his or her  address as it
appears on the records of the Corporation. No notice need be given to any
person with whom communication is unlawful, nor shall there be any duty to
apply for any permit or license to give notice to any such person. If the 
time and place of an adjourned meeting of shareholders are announced by the
Corporation at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, no notice need
be given of the adjourned meeting unless that adjournment is for more than 30
days or  unless, after the adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the
adjourned meeting. Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may
be given effectively to shareholders, any notice to shareholders under the
Corporation's  Certificate of Incorporation and these Bylaws may be given by
the Corporation by electronic transmission in the manner provided in Section
232 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL").

 


 

 

SECTION 1.5 Waiver of Notice.

 


 

 

Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, notice of any meeting of
shareholders need not be given to any  shareholder who in person or by proxy
shall have waived in writing notice of the meeting, either before or after
such meeting, or who shall attend the meeting in person or by proxy, unless
such shareholder attends for the express purpose of  objecting, at the

 

 

A-4  

beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

 


 

 

SECTION 1.6 Quorum and Manner of Acting.

 


 

 

Subject to the provisions of these Bylaws, the Corporation's Certificate of
Incorporation and statute as to the vote  that is required for a specified
action, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote at any meeting of
shareholders shall constitute a quorum for the  transaction of business, and
the vote in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares
constituting such quorum shall be binding on all shareholders of the
Corporation. The Chairman of the Board of Directors or the Chief  Executive
Officer or a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled
to vote may, regardless of whether or not they constitute a quorum, adjourn
the meeting to another time and place. No notice of the time and place, if 
any, of adjourned meetings need be given except as required by applicable law.
The shareholders present at a duly called meeting at which a quorum is present
may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding
withdrawal of  enough shareholders to leave is less than a quorum. Any
business which might have been transacted at the original meeting may be
transacted at any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present.

 


 

 

SECTION 1.7 Voting.

 


 

 

A shareholder may authorize another person or persons to vote for him, her or
itself by proxy. Such authorization may  be accomplished by the shareholder
or his, her or its authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing
such writing or causing his, her or its signature to be affixed to such
writing by any reasonable means including facsimile  signature or by
electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or
to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service, or similar agent duly
authorized by the intended proxy holder to receive such transmission;
provided, that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be
submitted with information from which it can be determined that  the
electronic transmission was authorized by the shareholder. No proxy shall be
voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides
for a longer period.

 


 

 

SECTION 1.8 Inspectors of Election; Opening and Closing the Polls.

 


 

 

The Board of Directors may, and to the extent required by law, shall, in
advance of any meeting of shareholders appoint  one or more inspectors, which
inspector or inspectors may include individuals who serve the Corporation in
other capacities, including without limitation as officers, employees,
fiduciaries or agents, to act at the meeting and make a written  report
thereof. The Board of Directors may designate one or more persons as alternate
inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or
alternate is able to act at a meeting of shareholders, the chairman of the 
meeting may, and to the extent required by law, shall, appoint one or more
inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before discharging his or
her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of
inspector with  strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her
ability. The inspector or inspectors of election shall have the duties
prescribed by law. The chairman of the meeting shall fix and announce at the
meeting the

 


 

 

 

A-5  

date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon
which the shareholders will vote at a meeting.

 


 

 

SECTION 1.9 List of Shareholders.

 


 

 

A complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote at each meeting of
shareholders, arranged in alphabetical order,  and showing the address and
number of shares registered in the name of each shareholder, shall be prepared
and made available for examination during regular business hours by any
shareholder for any purpose germane to the meeting. The list  shall be
available for such examination at the principal place of business of the
Corporation for a period of not less than 10 days prior to the meeting and
during the whole time of the meeting.

 


 

 

SECTION 1.10 Notice of Shareholder Business and Nominations.

 


 

 

(A) Annual Meetings of Shareholders.

 


 

 

(1) Nominations             of persons for election to the Board
of Directors of the Corporation and the proposal of business to be considered
by the shareholders may be made at an annual meeting of shareholders (a)
pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting, (b)  by or at the direction
of the Board of Directors or (c) by any shareholder of the Corporation who was
a shareholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this
Section 1.10 and, at the time of the annual meeting, who is  entitled to vote
at the meeting and who complied with the notice procedures set forth in this
Section 1.10 as to such business or nomination; clause (c) shall be the
exclusive means for a shareholder to make nominations or submit other 
business (other than nominations at an annual meeting made pursuant to Section
1.12 of these Bylaws and matters properly brought under Rule 14a-8 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and included
in the  Corporation's notice of meeting) before an annual meeting of
shareholders.

 


 

 

(2) Without             qualification, for any nominations or any
other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a
shareholder pursuant to clause (c) of paragraph (A)(1) of this Section 1.10,
the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof  in writing to the
Secretary of the Corporation and such other business must be a proper matter
for shareholder action. To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be
delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the 
Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day and not
later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the first
anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in
the event that the date of the annual meeting  is more than 30 days before or
more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder to be
timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the
120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not  later than the
close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the date of such
annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement
of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation. In no event 
shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or the announcement
thereof commence a new time period or extend any time period for the giving of
a shareholder's notice as described above. To be in proper form, such

 


 

 

 

A-6  

shareholder's notice (whether given pursuant to this paragraph (A)(2) or
paragraph (B) of Section 1.10) to the  Secretary must: (a) set forth, as to
the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose
behalf the nomination or proposal is made (such shareholder or beneficial
owner, a "holder"), (i) the name and address of each  such holder (as they
appear on the Corporation's books in the case of the record holder), (ii) (A)
the class or series and number of shares of the Corporation which are,
directly or indirectly, owned beneficially or of record by each such  holder,
(B) any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or
similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment
or mechanism at a price related to any class or series of shares of the 
Corporation or with a value derived in whole or in part from the value of any
class or series of shares of the Corporation, whether or not such instrument
or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying class or series of
capital  stock of the Corporation or otherwise (a "Derivative Instrument"),
directly or indirectly owned beneficially or of record by each such holder and
any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit
derived from any  increase or decrease in the value of shares of the
Corporation, (C) any proxy, contract, arrangement, understanding, or
relationship pursuant to which each such holder, directly or indirectly, has a
right to vote any shares of any security of  the Corporation, (D) any short
interest in any security of the Corporation (for purposes of these Bylaws a
person shall be deemed to have a short interest in a security if such person
directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement,  understanding,
relationship or otherwise, has the opportunity to profit or share in any
profit derived from any decrease in the value of the subject security), (E)
any rights to dividends on the shares of the Corporation owned beneficially
or  of record by each such holder that are separated or separable from the
underlying shares of the Corporation, (F) any proportionate interest in shares
of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly,
beneficially or  of record by a general or limited partnership in which each
such holder is a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially or
of record owns an interest in a general partner and (G) any performance-
related fees (other than an  asset-based fee) that each such holder is,
directly or indirectly, entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the
value of shares of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments, if any, as of
the date of such notice, including without  limitation any such interests
held, directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record by members of such
holder's immediate family sharing the same household (which information shall
be supplemented by such holder not later than 10 days after  the record date
for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date), and (iii)
any other information relating to each such holder that would be required to
be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made  in
connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal
and/or for the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to
Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder; (b) if  the notice relates to any business other than a
nomination of a director or directors that the shareholder proposes to bring
before the meeting, set forth (i) a brief description of the business desired
to be brought before the meeting, the  reasons for conducting such business
at the meeting and any material interest of any such holder in such business
and (ii) a description of all agreements, arrangements and understandings
between any such holder and any other person or  persons (including their
names) in connection with the proposal of such business by such shareholder;
(c) set forth, as to each person, if any,

 

 

A-7  

whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection to the
Board of Directors (i) all  information relating to such person that would be
required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be
made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors in
a contested election pursuant to  Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (including such person's written
consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a
director if elected) and (ii) a description of  all direct and indirect
compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements and
understandings during the past three years, and any other material
relationships, between or among any such holder and its affiliates and 
associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the one hand, and each
proposed nominee, and his or her respective affiliates and associates, or
others acting in concert therewith, on the other hand, including, without
limitation all  information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant
to Rule 404 promulgated under Regulation S-K if any such holder or any
affiliate or associate thereof or person acting in concert therewith, were the
"registrant" for purposes of  such rule and the nominee were a director or
executive officer of such registrant; and (d) with respect to each nominee for
election or reelection to the Board of Directors, include a completed and
signed questionnaire, representation and  agreement required by paragraph (C)
of this Section 1.10. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to
furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the
Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed  nominee to serve
as an independent director of the Corporation or that could be material to a
reasonable shareholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof,
of such nominee.

 


 

 

(3) Notwithstanding             anything in the second sentence of
paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 1.10 to the contrary, in the event that the
number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation
is increased and there is no public announcement  naming all of the nominees
for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors made
by the Corporation at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the
preceding year's annual meeting, a shareholder's notice  required by this
Section 1.10 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to
nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be
delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation  not later than the close of business on the 10th day following
the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.

 


 

 

(B) Special Meetings of Shareholders. Only such business shall be conducted at
a special meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought  before the
meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting. To be properly
brought before a special meeting, proposals of business must be specified in
the Corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) (a) given by
or  at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) given by the
Corporation pursuant to a valid shareholder written request in accordance with
Section 1.2 of these Bylaws; provided, however, that nothing herein shall
prohibit the Board of Directors from submitting  additional matters to
shareholders at any such special meeting. Without qualification, and subject
to Section 1.2 and paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 1.10, for any business to
be properly requested to be brought before a special meeting by  a
shareholder pursuant to this paragraph (B), the shareholder must have given
timely notice thereof and timely updates and supplements thereof in

 


 

 

 

A-8  

each case in proper form, in writing to the Secretary and such business must
otherwise be a proper matter for shareholder action.   Nominations of persons
for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of
shareholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the
Corporation's notice of meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board of 
Directors or (b) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that
directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any shareholder of the
Corporation who is a shareholder of record at the time of giving of notice
provided for in this  Section 1.10 and at the time of the special meeting,
who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice
procedures set forth in this Section 1.10 as to such nomination. In the event
the Corporation calls a special  meeting of shareholders for the purpose of
electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such shareholder
may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such
position(s) as specified in the Corporation's  notice of meeting, if the
shareholder's notice required by paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 1.10 with
respect to any nomination (including the completed and signed questionnaire,
representation and agreement required by paragraph (C) of this  Section 1.10)
shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to
the date of such special meeting and not later than the close of business  on
the later of the 90th day prior to the date of such special meeting or the
10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the
date of the special meeting and, if applicable, of the nominees proposed by
the Board  of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall any
adjournment or postponement of a special meeting or the announcement thereof
commence a new time period or extend any time period for the giving of a
shareholder's notice as  described above. This paragraph (B) of this Section
1.10 (and subject to Section 1.2) shall be the exclusive means for a
shareholder to make nominations or business proposals (other than matters
properly brought pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under  the Exchange Act and included
in the Corporation's notice of meeting) before a special meeting of
shareholders.

 


 

 

(C) Submission of Questionnaire, Representation and Agreements. To be eligible
to be a nominee for election or reelection as a director of the  Corporation,
a person must deliver (in accordance with the time periods prescribed for
delivery of notice under this Section 1.10 or Section 1.12 of these Bylaws, as
applicable) to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the 
Corporation a completed and signed written questionnaire with respect to the
background and qualification of such person and the background of any other
person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made (which
questionnaire shall  be provided by the Secretary upon written request) and a
written representation and agreement (in the form provided by the Secretary
upon written request) that such person (1) is not and will not become a party
to (a) any agreement,  arrangement or understanding with, and has not given
any commitment or assurance to, any person or entity as to how such person, if
elected as a director of the Corporation, will act or vote on any issue or
question (a "Voting Commitment")  that has not been disclosed to the
Corporation or (b) any Voting Commitment that could limit or interfere with
such person's ability to comply, if elected as a director of the Corporation,
with such person's fiduciary duties under applicable  law, (2) is not and
will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding with
any person or entity other than the Corporation with respect to any direct or
indirect compensation, reimbursement or indemnification in  connection with
service or action as a director that has not been disclosed therein, and (3)
in such person's individual capacity and on behalf of any person or entity on
whose behalf the nomination is being made, would be in compliance, if 
elected as a director of the Corporation, and will comply with all applicable
law

 


 

 

 

A-9  

and with the Corporation's Code of Ethics, corporate governance guidelines,
conflict of interest policy, confidentiality policies, stock  ownership and
trading policies and guidelines, and any other code of conduct, policies and
guidelines adopted by the Corporation or any rules, regulations and listing
standards, in each case as applicable to other members of the Board of 
Directors.

 


 

 

(D) General.

 


 

 

(1) Only            such persons who are nominated in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.10 or Section 1.12 of these
Bylaws, as applicable, shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such
business shall be conducted at a meeting of  shareholders as shall have been
brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Section 1.10. Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman of the meeting
shall have the power and duty to determine whether  a nomination or any
business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made, or proposed, as
the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section
1.10 or Section 1.12 of these Bylaws, as applicable, and, if any  proposed
nomination or business is not in compliance with this Section 1.10 or Section
1.12 of these Bylaws, as applicable, to declare that such defective proposal
or nomination shall be disregarded.

 


 

 

(2) For  purposes of this Section 1.10, "public announcement" shall mean
disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,
Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly
filed by the Corporation with  the Securities and Exchange Commission
pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder.

 


 

 

(3) Notwithstanding             the foregoing provisions of this
Section 1.10 and/or Section 1.12 of these Bylaws, as applicable, a shareholder
shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder with respect to  the matters set forth in
this Section 1.10 and/or Section 1.12 of these Bylaws, as applicable;
provided, however, that any references in this Section 1.10 and/or Section
1.12 of these Bylaws, as applicable, to the Exchange Act or the rules
promulgated thereunder are not  intended to and shall not limit the
requirements applicable to nominations or proposals as to any other business
to be considered pursuant to Section 1.10 (A)(1)(c), Section 1.10 (B) or
Section 1.12 of these Bylaws, as applicable. Nothing in  this Section 1.10 or
in Section 1.12 of these Bylaws, as applicable, shall be deemed to affect any
rights of shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's
proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or  of the
holders of any series of preferred stock if and to the extent provided for
under law, the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.

 


 

 

SECTION 1.11

 


 

 

(A) Consents to Corporate Action. Any action which is required to be or may be
taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders of the  Corporation,
subject to the provisions of Subsections (B) and (C) of this Section 1.11, may
be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote if
consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken,

 


 

 

 

A-10  

shall have been signed by the holders of the outstanding stock having not less
than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to  authorize or to
take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon
were present and voted; provided, however, that prompt notice of the taking of
the corporate action without a meeting and by less than unanimous written
consent shall be given  to those shareholders who have not consented in
writing.

 


 

 

(B) Determination of Record Date of Action by Written Consent. The record date
for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate  action in
writing without a meeting shall be fixed by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders
authorize or take corporate action by written consent without a meeting shall,
by  written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a
record date. Upon receipt of such a request, the Secretary shall place such
request before the Board of Directors at its next regularly scheduled meeting;
provided, however, that if the  shareholder represents in such request that
he or she intends, and is prepared, to commence a consent solicitation as soon
as is permitted by the Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder and other
applicable law, the Secretary shall as  promptly as practicable, call a
special meeting of the Board of Directors, which meeting shall be held as
promptly as practicable. At such regular or special meeting, the Board of
Directors shall fix a record date as provided in Section 213  (or its
successor provision) of the DGCL. Should the Board fail to fix a record date
as provided for in this Subsection (B), then the record date shall be the day
on which the first written consent is expressed.

 


 

 

(C) Procedures for Written Consent. In the event of the delivery to the
Corporation of a written consent or consents purporting to represent the 
requisite voting power to authorize or take corporate action and/or related
revocations, the Secretary shall provide for the safekeeping of such consents
and revocations and shall, as promptly as practicable, engage nationally
recognized  independent judges of election for the purpose of promptly
performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and
revocations. No action by written consent and without a meeting shall be
effective until such judges have  completed their review, determined that the
requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents has been obtained to
authorize or take the action specified in the consents, and certified such
determination for entry in the records of the  Corporation kept for the
purpose of recording the proceedings of meetings of shareholders.

 


 

 

 

 

 

SECTION 1.12 Inclusion of Shareholder  Director Nominations in the
Corporation's Proxy Materials.

 

 

 

 


 

 

(A) Subject to the terms  and conditions set forth in these Bylaws, the
Corporation shall include in its proxy materials for an annual meeting of
shareholders the name, together with the Required Information (defined below),
of any person nominated for election (the  "Shareholder Nominee") to the
Board of Directors by a shareholder or group of shareholders that satisfy the
requirements of this Section 1.12 (such person or group, the "Eligible
Shareholder"), and that expressly elects at the time of  providing the
written notice required by this Section 1.12 (a "Proxy Access Notice") to have
its nominee included in the Corporation's proxy materials pursuant to this
Section 1.12.

 


 

 

(1) For  purposes of this Section 1.12 and Section 1.2 of these Bylaws,
"Constituent Holder" shall mean any shareholder, beneficial holder or
collective 
 

 

 

A-11  

investment fund included within a Qualifying Fund (as defined in paragraph (E)
below) whose stock ownership is  counted for the purposes of qualifying as
holding the Special Meeting Request Required Shares (in Section 1.2) or the
Proxy Access Request Required Shares (in this Section 1.12, as defined in
paragraph (E) below) or qualifying as an Eligible  Shareholder (in this
Section 1.12, as defined in paragraph (E) below);

 


 

 

(2) For  purposes of this Section 1.12 and Section 1.2 of these Bylaws,
"affiliate" and "associate" shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in Rule
405 under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that the term "partner" as used
in the definition of "associate" shall not include  any limited partner that
is not involved in the management of the relevant partnership; and

 


 

 

(3) For  purposes of this Section 1.12 and Section 1.2 of these Bylaws, a
shareholder shall be deemed to "own" only those outstanding shares of Voting
Stock as to which the shareholder (or any Constituent Holder) possesses both
(a) the full voting and  investment rights pertaining to the shares and (b)
the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit and risk
of loss on) such shares. The number of shares calculated in accordance with
the foregoing clauses (a) and (b)  shall be deemed not to include (and to the
extent any of the following arrangements have been entered into by affiliates
of the shareholder (or of any Constituent Holder), shall be reduced by) any
shares (x) sold by such shareholder (or any  of its affiliates) in any
transaction that has not been settled or closed, including any short sale, (y)
borrowed by such shareholder (or any of its affiliates) for any purposes or
purchased by such shareholder (or any of its affiliates)  pursuant to an
agreement to resell or (z) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract,
swap, contract of sale, other derivative or similar agreement entered into by
such shareholder (or any of its affiliates), whether any such instrument  or
agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional
amount or value of Voting Stock, in any such case which instrument or
agreement has, or is intended to have, or if exercised by either party thereto
would have, the  purpose or effect of (i) reducing in any manner, to any
extent or at any time in the future, such shareholder's (or affiliate's) full
right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and/or (ii) hedging,
offsetting or altering to any  degree gain or loss arising from the full
economic ownership of such shares by such shareholder (or affiliate), other
than any such arrangements solely involving an exchange listed multi-industry
market index fund in which Voting Stock  represents at the time of entry into
such arrangement less than 10% of the proportionate value of such index. A
shareholder shall "own" shares held in the name of a nominee or other
intermediary so long as the shareholder retains the right  to instruct how
the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and the right
to direct the disposition thereof and possesses the full economic interest in
the shares. A shareholder's ownership of shares shall be deemed to  continue
during any period in which the shareholder has loaned such shares or delegated
any voting power over such shares by means of a proxy, power of attorney or
other instrument or arrangement which in either case is revocable at any
time  by the shareholder. The terms "owned," "owning" and other variations of
the word "own" shall have correlative meanings.

 


 

 

(B) For purposes of this  Section 1.12, the "Required Information" that the
Corporation will include in its proxy statement is (1) the information
concerning the Shareholder

 


 

 

 

A-12  

Nominee and the Eligible Shareholder that the Corporation determines is
required to be disclosed in the Corporation's proxy statement by  the
regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and (2) if the Eligible
Shareholder so elects, a Statement (defined below). The Corporation shall also
include the name of the Shareholder Nominee in its proxy card. For the
avoidance of  doubt, and any other provision of these Bylaws notwithstanding,
the Corporation may in its sole discretion solicit against, and include in the
proxy statement its own statements or other information relating to, any
Eligible Shareholder  and/or Shareholder Nominee, including any information
provided to the Corporation with respect to the foregoing.

 


 

 

(C) To be timely, a  shareholder's Proxy Access Notice must be delivered to
the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close
of business on the 150th day and not later than the close of business on the
120th day prior to the  anniversary of the date that the Corporation first
issued its proxy statement for the preceding year's annual meeting. In no
event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting, the date of
which has been announced by the  Corporation, commence a new time period for
the giving of a Proxy Access Notice.

 


 

 

(D) The number of  Shareholder Nominees (including Shareholder Nominees that
were submitted by an Eligible Shareholder for inclusion in the Corporation's
proxy materials pursuant to this Section 1.12 but either are subsequently
withdrawn or that the Board of  Directors decides to nominate as Board of
Directors' nominees) appearing in the Corporation's proxy materials with
respect to an annual meeting of shareholders shall be the greater of (x) one
and (y) the largest whole number that does not  exceed 20% of the number of
directors in office as of the last day on which a Proxy Access Notice may be
delivered in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.12
(such greater number, the "Permitted Number"); provided, however, that the
Permitted  Number shall be reduced by:

 


 

 

(1) the  number of such director candidates for which the Corporation shall
have received one or more valid shareholder notices nominating director
candidates pursuant to Section 1.10 (A)(1)(c) of these Bylaws;

 


 

 

(2) the  number of directors in office or director candidates that in either
case will be included in the Corporation's proxy materials with respect to
such annual meeting as an unopposed (by the Corporation) nominee pursuant to
any agreement,  arrangement or other understanding with any shareholder or
group of shareholders (other than any such agreement, arrangement or
understanding entered into in connection with an acquisition of Voting Stock,
by such shareholder or group of  shareholders, from the Corporation), other
than any such director referred to in this clause (2) who at the time of such
annual meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of
the Board of Directors, for at least two  annual terms, but only to the
extent the Permitted Number after such reduction with respect to this clause
(2) equals or exceeds one; and

 


 

 

(3) the  number of directors in office that will be included in the
Corporation's proxy materials with respect to such annual meeting for whom
access to the Corporation's proxy materials was previously provided pursuant
to this Section 1.12, other  than any such director referred to in this
clause (3) who at the time of such annual

 


 

 

 

A-13  

meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the Board
of Directors, for at least two  annual terms;

 


 

 

provided, further, that in the event the Board of Directors resolves to reduce
the size of the Board of Directors effective on or prior to the date of the
annual meeting,  the Permitted Number shall be calculated based on the number
of directors in office as so reduced. In the event that the number of
Shareholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Shareholders pursuant to this
Section 1.12 exceeds the Permitted  Number, each Eligible Shareholder will
select one Shareholder Nominee for inclusion in the Corporation's proxy
materials until the Permitted Number is reached, going in order of the amount
(largest to smallest) of shares of Voting Stock each  Eligible Shareholder
disclosed as owned in its Proxy Access Notice submitted to the Corporation. If
the Permitted Number is not reached after each Eligible Shareholder has
selected one Shareholder Nominee, this selection process will  continue as
many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the
Permitted Number is reached.

 


 

 

(E) An "Eligible  Shareholder" is one or more shareholders of record who own
and have owned, or are acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners who
own and have owned (in each case as defined above), continuously for at least
three years as of both the  date that the Proxy Access Notice is received by
the Corporation pursuant to this Section 1.12, and as of the record date for
determining shareholders eligible to vote at the annual meeting, at least 3%
of the aggregate voting power of the  Voting Stock (the "Proxy Access Request
Required Shares"), and who continue to own the Proxy Access Request Required
Shares at all times between the date such Proxy Access Notice is received by
the Corporation and the date of the applicable  annual meeting; provided that
the aggregate number of shareholders, and, if and to the extent that a
shareholder is acting on behalf of  one or more beneficial owners, of such
beneficial owners, whose stock ownership is counted for the purpose of
satisfying the foregoing ownership requirement shall not exceed 20. Two or
more collective investment funds that are part of the  same family of funds
or sponsored by the same employer (a "Qualifying Fund") shall be treated as
one shareholder for the purpose of determining the aggregate number of
shareholders in this paragraph (E); provided that each fund included within a
Qualifying Fund otherwise meets the requirements set forth in this Section
1.12. No shares may be attributed to more than  one group constituting an
Eligible Shareholder under this Section 1.12, and no shareholder may be a
member of more than one such group. A record holder acting on behalf of one or
more beneficial owners will not be counted separately as a  shareholder with
respect to the shares owned by beneficial owners on whose behalf such record
holder has been directed in writing to act, but each such beneficial owner
will be counted separately, subject to the other provisions of this 
paragraph (E), for purposes of determining the number of shareholders whose
holdings may be considered as part of an Eligible Shareholder's holdings. For
avoidance of doubt, Proxy Access Request Required Shares will qualify as such
only if  the beneficial owner of such shares as of the date of the Proxy
Access Notice has itself individually beneficially owned such shares
continuously for the three-year period ending on that date and through other
applicable dates referred to  above (in addition to other applicable
requirements being met).

 


 

 

(F) No later than the  final date when a nomination pursuant to this Section
1.12 may be delivered to the Corporation, an Eligible Shareholder (including
each Constituent Holder) must provide the following information in writing to
the Secretary of the Corporation:

 


 

 

 

A-14  

(1) with             respect to each Constituent Holder, the
information required by Section 1.10 (A)(2)(a) of these Bylaws;

 


 

 

(2) one  or more written statements from the record holder of the shares (and
from each intermediary through which the shares are or have been held during
the requisite three-year holding period) verifying that, as of a date within
seven calendar days  prior to the date the Proxy Access Notice is delivered
to the Corporation, such person owns, and has owned continuously for the
preceding three years, the Proxy Access Request Required Shares, and such
person's agreement to provide:

 


 

 

(a) within            10 days after the record date for the annual
meeting, written statements from the record holder and intermediaries
verifying such person's continuous ownership of the Proxy Access Request
Required Shares through the record date, together with  any additional
information reasonably requested to verify such person's ownership of the
Proxy Access Request Required Shares; and

 


 

 

(b) immediate             notice if the Eligible Shareholder
ceases to own any of the Proxy Access Request Required Shares prior to the
date of the applicable annual meeting of shareholders;

 


 

 

(3) a  representation that such person:

 


 

 

(a) acquired             the Proxy Access Request Required Shares
in the ordinary course of business and not with the intent to change or
influence control of the Corporation, and does not presently have such intent;

 


 

 

(b) has  not nominated and will not nominate for election to the Board of
Directors at the annual meeting any person other than the Shareholder
Nominee(s) being nominated pursuant to this Section 1.12;

 


 

 

(c) has  not engaged and will not engage in, and has not and will not be a
"participant" in another person's, "solicitation" within the meaning of Rule
14a-1(l) under the Exchange Act in support of the election of any individual
as a director at the  annual meeting other than its Shareholder Nominee(s) or
a nominee of the Board of Directors;

 


 

 

(d) will            not distribute to any shareholder any form of
proxy for the annual meeting other than the form distributed by the
Corporation; and

 


 

 

(e) will             provide facts, statements and other
information in all communications with the Corporation and its shareholders
that are and will be true and correct in all material respects and do not and
will not omit to state a material fact necessary in  order to make the

misleading, and will otherwise comply with all applicable laws, rules and
regulations in connection with any actions taken pursuant to this  Section
1.12;

 


 

 

 

A-15  

(4) in  the case of a nomination by a group of shareholders that together is
such an Eligible Shareholder, the designation by all group members of one
group member that is authorized to act on behalf of all members of the
nominating shareholder group  with respect to the nomination and matters
related thereto, including withdrawal of the nomination; and

 


 

 

(5) an  undertaking that such person:

 


 

 

(a) with             respect to any shares held or controlled by
the Eligible Shareholder, to the extent that cumulative voting would otherwise
be permitted, agrees not to cumulate votes in favor of the election of any
Shareholder Nominee(s) nominated by such  Eligible Shareholder;

against the Corporation or any of its directors, officers or employees arising

In addition, no later than the final date on which a Proxy Access Notice may
be submitted under this Section 1.12, a  Qualifying Fund whose stock
ownership is counted for purposes of qualifying as an Eligible Shareholder
must provide to the Secretary of the Corporation documentation reasonably
satisfactory to the Board of Directors that demonstrates that the  funds
included within the Qualifying Fund are either part of the same family of
funds or sponsored by the same employer. In order to be considered timely, any
information required by this Section 1.12 to be provided to the Corporation
must  be supplemented (by delivery to the Secretary of the Corporation) (1)
no later than 10 days following the record date for the applicable annual
meeting, to disclose the foregoing information as of such record date, and (2)
no later than the  fifth day before the annual meeting, to disclose the
foregoing information as of the date that is no later than 10 days prior to
such annual meeting. For the avoidance of doubt, the requirement to update and
supplement such information shall  not permit any Eligible Shareholder or
other person to change or add any proposed Shareholder Nominee or be deemed to
cure any defects or limit the remedies (including without limitation under
these Bylaws) available to the Corporation  relating to any defect.

 


 

 

(G) The Eligible  Shareholder may provide to the Secretary of the
Corporation, at the time the information required by this Section 1.12 is
originally provided, a written statement for inclusion in the Corporation's
proxy statement for the annual meeting, not  to exceed 500 words,

 


 

 

 

A-16  

in support of the candidacy of such Eligible Shareholder's Shareholder Nominee
(the "Statement"). Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary contained in
this Section 1.12, the Corporation may omit from its proxy materials any
information or Statement that it, in good faith, believes is materially false
or misleading, omits to state any material fact, or would violate any 
applicable law or regulation.

 


 

 

(H) No later than the  final date when a nomination pursuant to this Section
1.12 may be delivered to the Corporation, each Shareholder Nominee must:

 


 

 

(1) provide             an executed agreement, in a form deemed
satisfactory by the Board of Directors or its designee (which form shall be
provided by the Corporation reasonably promptly upon written request of a
shareholder), that such Shareholder Nominee consents  to being named in the
Corporation's proxy statement and form of proxy card (and will not agree to be
named in any other person's proxy statement or form of proxy card) as a
nominee and to serving as a director of the Corporation if elected;

 


 

 

(2) complete,             sign and submit all questionnaires,
representations and agreements required by these Bylaws (including Section
1.10(C) of these Bylaws) or of the Corporation's directors generally; and

 


 

 

(3) provide             such additional information as necessary
to permit the Board of Directors to determine if such Shareholder Nominee:

 


 

 

(a) is  independent under the listing standards of each principal U.S.
exchange upon which the common stock of the Corporation is listed, any
applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and any publicly
disclosed standards used by the  Board of Directors in determining and
disclosing the independence of the Corporation's directors;

 


 

 

(b) would             not, by serving as a member of the Board of
Directors, violate or cause the Corporation to be in violation of these
Bylaws, the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, the rules and listing
standards of the principal U.S. exchange upon  which the common stock of the
Corporation is traded or any applicable law, rule or regulation;

 


 

 

(c) has  any direct or indirect relationship with the Corporation other than
those relationships that have been deemed categorically immaterial pursuant to
the Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines; and

 


 

 

(d) is  not and has not been subject to any event specified in Item 401(f) of
Regulation S-K (or successor rule) of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 


 

 

In the event that any information or communications provided by the Eligible
Shareholder (or any Constituent Holder) or  the Shareholder Nominee to the
Corporation or its shareholders ceases to be true and correct in all material
respects or omits a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made,  not misleading, each
Eligible Shareholder or Shareholder Nominee, as the case may be,

 

 

A-17  


  shall promptly notify the Secretary of the Corporation of any defect in
such previously provided information and of the information that is required
to correct any such defect; it being understood for the avoidance of doubt
that providing any  such notification shall not be deemed to cure any such
defect or limit the remedies (including without limitation under these Bylaws)
available to the Corporation relating to any such defect.

 


 

 

(I) Any Shareholder  Nominee who is included in the Corporation's proxy
statement for a particular annual meeting of shareholders, but subsequently is
determined not to satisfy the eligibility requirements of this Section 1.12 or
any other provision of these  Bylaws, the Corporation's Certificate of
Incorporation or other applicable regulation any time before the annual
meeting of shareholders, will not be eligible for election at such annual
meeting of shareholders.

 


 

 

(J) The Corporation shall  not be required to include, pursuant to this
Section 1.12, a Shareholder Nominee in its proxy materials for any annual
meeting of shareholders, or, if the proxy statement already has been filed, to
allow the nomination of a Shareholder  Nominee, notwithstanding that proxies
in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation:

 


 

 

(1) who  is not independent under the listing standards of the principal U.S.
exchange upon which the common stock of the Corporation is listed, any
applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and any publicly
disclosed standards used  by the Board of Directors in determining and
disclosing independence of the Corporation's directors, in each case as
determined by the Board of Directors;

 


 

 

(2) whose             service as a member of the Board of
Directors would violate or cause the Corporation to be in violation of these
Bylaws, the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, the rules and listing
standards of the principal U.S. exchange upon which  the common stock of the
Corporation is traded or any applicable law, rule or regulation;

 


 

 

(3) if  the Eligible Shareholder (or any Constituent Holder) or applicable
Shareholder Nominee otherwise breaches or fails to comply in any material
respect with its obligations pursuant to this Section 1.12 or any agreement,
representation or  undertaking required by this Section; or

 


 

 

(4) if  the Eligible Shareholder ceases to be an Eligible Shareholder for any
reason, including but not limited to not owning the Proxy Access Request
Required Shares through the date of the applicable annual meeting.

 


 

 

For the purposes of this paragraph (J), clauses (1) and (2) and, to the extent
related to a breach or failure by the  Shareholder Nominee, clause (3) will
result in the exclusion from the proxy materials pursuant to this Section 1.12
of the specific Shareholder Nominee to whom the ineligibility applies, or, if
the proxy statement already has been filed, the  ineligibility of such
Shareholder Nominee to be nominated; provided, however, clause (4) and, to the
extent related to a breach or failure by an Eligible Shareholder (or any
Constituent Holder), clause (3), will result in the Voting Stock owned by such
Eligible  Shareholder (or Constituent Holder) being excluded from the Proxy
Access Request Required Shares (and, if as a result the Proxy Access Notice
shall no longer have been filed by an Eligible Shareholder, the exclusion from
the proxy

 


 

 

 

A-18  

materials pursuant to this Section 1.12 of all of the applicable shareholder's
Shareholder Nominees from the applicable annual meeting of  shareholders or,
if the proxy statement has already been filed, the ineligibility of all of
such shareholder's Shareholder Nominees to be nominated).

 


 

 

SECTION 2 - Board of Directors

 


 

 

SECTION 2.1 Number and Term of Office.

 


 

 

The number of directors shall be not less than 10 nor more than 19; provided,
that such number may be increased to the extent necessary to comply with
Section 2.18(F) of these Bylaws. The exact number, within those limits, shall
be determined from time  to time by the Board of Directors. Each director
shall be elected annually to serve until the annual meeting of shareholders
held in the following fiscal year and shall hold office until a successor is
elected and qualified or until his or  her earlier death, resignation or
removal.

 


 

 

SECTION 2.2 Election.

 


 

 

A nominee for director shall be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes
cast "for" such nominee's election  exceed 50% of the votes cast with respect
to such nominee's election at a meeting for the election of directors at which
a quorum is present. Votes cast shall include "against" votes, but shall
exclude abstentions with respect to that  nominee's election or with respect
to the election of directors in general.

 


 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a contested election of
directors, directors shall be elected by a  plurality of the votes cast at
any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. For
purposes of this Section 2.2, a contested election shall mean any election of
directors in which the number of candidates for election  as directors
exceeds the number of directors to be elected, with the determination thereof
being made by the Secretary (a) as of the close of the applicable notice of
nomination period(s) set forth in Section 1.12 and Section 1.10 of these 
Bylaws based on whether one or more notice(s) of nomination were timely filed
in accordance with said Section 1.12 and/or Section 1.10 or (b) if later,
reasonably promptly following the determination by any court or other tribunal
of  competent jurisdiction that one or more notice(s) of nomination were
timely filed in accordance with said Section 1.12 and/or Section 1.10;
provided,  that the determination that an election is a "contested election"
by the Secretary pursuant to clause (a) or (b) shall be determinative only as
to the timeliness of a notice of nomination and not otherwise as to its
validity. If, prior to  the tenth day before the Corporation first mails its
notice of meeting for such meeting to the shareholders, one or more notices of
nomination are withdrawn (or declared invalid or untimely by any court or
other tribunal of competent  jurisdiction) such that the number of candidates
for election as director no longer exceeds the number of directors to be
elected, the election shall not be considered a contested election, but in all
other cases, once an election is  determined to be a contested election,
directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast.

 


 

 

 

A-19

Continuing Independent Director qualifies as an Independent Director and (2)
unless such RTN Continuing Independent Director or UTC Continuing Independent
Director, as applicable, notifies the Board of Directors of his or her

its successor committee) or the Board of Directors in accordance with the
immediately preceding proviso, a majority of the remaining RTN Continuing
Directors or UTC Continuing Directors, as applicable, shall propose  another
individual (and this process shall be repeated) until such an individual
proposed by a majority of the remaining RTN Continuing Directors or UTC
Continuing Directors, respectively, is duly nominated to serve as a member of

number of shares owned by such shareholder in the Corporation; provided, that,
where such certificate is countersigned by a Transfer Agent or a Registrar,

case any officer or officers who shall have signed or whose facsimile
signature or signatures shall have been used on any such certificate or
certificates shall cease to be such officer or officers,  whether because of

Shares of the Corporation may be transferred upon authorization by the record

A-29  

assignment in writing on the back of the certificates or by written power of
attorney to sell, assign or transfer the same, signed by the  record holder
thereof, but no transfer shall affect the right of the Corporation to pay any
dividend upon the shares to the holder of record thereof, or to treat the
holder of record as the holder in fact thereof for all purposes; and no 
transfer shall be valid, except between the parties thereto, until such
transfer shall have been made upon the books of the Corporation.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.4 Lost Certificates.

 


 

 

In case any certificate for shares of the Corporation shall be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Board of Directors, in  its discretion, or any Transfer Agent
thereunto duly authorized by the Board, may authorize the issuance of a
substitute certificate in place of the certificate so lost, stolen or
destroyed, and may cause such substitute certificate to be  countersigned by
the appropriate Transfer Agent (if any) and registered by the appropriate
Registrar (if any); provided, that in each  such case, the applicant for a
substitute certificate shall furnish to the Corporation and to such of its
Transfer Agents and Registrars as may require same, evidence to their

conversion or exchange of shares or for the purpose of any other lawful
action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date which shall
be not more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of any meeting of 
shareholders, and not more than 60 days prior to any other action. In such
case, those shareholders, and only those shareholders, who are shareholders of
record on the date fixed by the Board of Directors shall, notwithstanding
any  subsequent transfer of shares on the books of the Corporation, be
entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting of shareholders, or any
adjournment thereof, or to consent to such corporate action in writing without
a meeting, or be  entitled to receive payment of such dividend or other

year, the shareholders shall be furnished with consolidated financial
statements of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, as at the end
of such fiscal  year, duly certified by such Independent Accountants, subject
to such notes or comments as the Independent Accountants shall deem necessary
or desirable for the information of the shareholders. In case the shareholders
shall at any time fail  to appoint Independent Accountants or in case the
Independent Accountants appointed by the shareholders shall decline to act or
shall resign or otherwise become incapable of acting, the Board of Directors
shall appoint Independent Accountants  to discharge the duties provided for
herein. Any Independent Accountants appointed pursuant to any of the
provisions hereof shall be directly responsible to the shareholders, and the
fees and expenses of any such Independent Accountants  shall be paid by the
Corporation.

 


 

 

SECTION 6.5 Indemnification of Officers, Directors, Employees and Fiduciaries;
Insurance.

 


 

 

(A) The Corporation shall  indemnify and hold harmless, in accordance with
and to the full extent permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware as in
effect at the time of the adoption of this Section 6.5 or as such laws may be
amended from time to time (but, in the  case of any such amendment, only to
the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide
prior to such amendment), any person (and the heirs and  legal
representatives of any such person) made or threatened to be made a party to
(or, in the case of directors and officers, otherwise involved in), any
threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, arbitration, alternative
dispute  resolution procedure, legislative hearing or inquiry or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (hereinafter a
"proceeding"), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director,
officer or employee of  the Corporation, of any constituent corporation
absorbed in a consolidation or merger or of a Subsidiary of the Corporation,
or serves or served as such or in a fiduciary capacity with another enterprise
at the request of the Corporation, any  such constituent corporation or a
Subsidiary, whether the basis of such proceeding is an alleged action in an
official capacity as a director, officer or employee or in any other capacity
while serving as a director, officer or employee,  against all expenses,
liabilities and losses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees,
judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid

 


 

 

 

A-31  

or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by any such
person in connection with such proceeding.

 


 

 

(B) In furtherance of the  foregoing indemnification provisions and not in
limitation thereof, the Corporation shall pay or reimburse all expenses
(including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred by any person who is or was a
director or officer of the Corporation, any  such constituent corporation or
any Subsidiary and any such person who serves or served as such or in a
fiduciary capacity at the request of one of the foregoing entities with
another enterprise in advance of the final disposition of any such 
proceeding, promptly upon receipt by the Corporation of an undertaking of such
person to repay such expenses if it shall ultimately be determined by final
judicial decision from which there is no further right of appeal that such
person is  not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. Subject to the
approval of either (i) the Chief Executive Officer or (ii) the General Counsel
and the Chief Financial Officer acting together and upon such terms and
conditions as the  approving officer or officers deem appropriate, the
Corporation may provide independent legal counsel or pay or reimburse the
expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred by any person who is
or was an employee of the Corporation,  any constituent corporation or any
Subsidiary and any such person who serves or served as such or in a fiduciary
capacity at the request of one of the foregoing entities with another
enterprise in advance of the final disposition of any such  proceeding,
promptly upon receipt by the Corporation of an undertaking of such person to
repay such expenses if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial
decision from which there is no further right of appeal that such person is 
not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation.

 


 

 

(C) The rights provided by  this Section 6.5 to any person who serves or
served as a director or officer of the Corporation, a constituent corporation
or a Subsidiary or as such or in a fiduciary capacity with another enterprise
at the request of one of the foregoing  entities shall be rights of contract
enforceable against the Corporation by such person, who shall be presumed to
have relied upon such rights in determining to serve or continuing to serve in
such capacity, and shall vest at the time such  person begins serving in such
capacity. In addition, the rights provided to any such person by this Section
6.5 shall survive the termination of such person's service in any such
capacity. Such rights shall continue as long as such person  shall be subject
to any possible proceeding. No amendment of this Section 6.5 shall impair the
rights of any such person arising at any time with respect to events occurring
prior to such amendment.

 


 

 

(D) Notwithstanding  anything contained in this Section 6.5, except for
proceedings to enforce rights provided in this Section 6.5, the Corporation
shall not be obligated under this Section 6.5 to provide any indemnification
or any payment or reimbursement of  expenses to any director, officer,
employee or other person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such person (which shall not include counterclaims or cross-
claims initiated by others) unless the Board of Directors  has authorized or
consented to such proceeding (or part thereof) in a resolution adopted by the
Board.

 


 

 

(E) For purposes of this  Section 6.5, the term "Subsidiary" shall mean any
corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity in which
the Corporation owns, directly or indirectly, a majority of the economic or
voting ownership interest or voting  power to elect a majority of the
directors of such entity; the term "other enterprise" shall include any
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust,
association or other

 

 

A-32  


  unincorporated organization or other entity and any employee benefit plan;
service "at the request of the Corporation" shall include service as a
director, officer, employee or fiduciary of the Corporation, a constituent
corporation or a  Subsidiary which imposes duties on, or involves services
by, such person with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or
beneficiaries; any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an
employee benefit plan shall be  deemed to be indemnifiable expenses; and
action by a person with respect to an employee benefit plan which such person
reasonably believes to be in the interest of the participants and
beneficiaries of such plan shall be deemed to be action  not opposed to the
best interests of the Corporation.

 


 

 

(F) Nothing in this  Section 6.5 shall limit the power of the Corporation or
the Board of Directors to provide rights of indemnification and to make
payment and reimbursement of expenses, including attorneys' fees, to
directors, officers, employees, agents,  fiduciaries and other persons
otherwise than pursuant to this Section 6.5. The rights to indemnification and
to receive payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance
of its final disposition conferred in this Section 6.5  shall not be
exclusive of any other rights which any person may have or hereafter acquire
under any statute, provision of the Corporation's Certificate of
Incorporation, these Bylaws, agreement or otherwise.

 


 

 

(G) If any provision or  provisions of this Section 6.5 shall be held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (1) the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Section 6.5
(including, without limitation,  each portion of any paragraph of this
Section 6.5 containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (2)
to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this  Section 6.5
(including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this
Section 6.5 containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent
manifested by  the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

 


 

 

(H) Subject to the  approval of either (i) the Chief Executive Officer or
(ii) the General Counsel and the Chief Financial Officer acting together and
upon such terms and conditions as the approving officer or officers deem
appropriate, the Corporation may  provide to any person who is or was an
agent or fiduciary of the Corporation, a constituent corporation, a Subsidiary
or an employee benefit plan of one of such entities rights of indemnification
and to receive payment or reimbursement of  expenses (including in advance of
the final disposition of any proceeding), including attorneys' fees, to the
fullest extent of the provisions of this Section 6.5 with respect to the
indemnification of and payment or reimbursement of expenses  of directors and
officers of the Corporation, constituent corporations, Subsidiaries or other
enterprises. Any such rights, if provided, shall have the same force and
effect as they would have if they were conferred in this Section 6.5.

 


 

 

(I) Subject to the  approval of either the Chief Financial Officer or the
Vice President, Treasurer, the Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance
in such amounts as the Board of Directors deems appropriate to protect each of
itself and any person who is  or was a director, officer, employee, agent or
fiduciary of the Corporation, a constituent corporation, or a Subsidiary or is
or was serving at the request of one of such entities as a director, officer,
employee, agent or fiduciary of  another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other

 


 

 

 

A-33  

enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by
such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such  person's status as
such, whether or not the Corporation shall have the power to indemnify such
person against such liability under the provisions of this Section 6.5 and the
laws of the State of Delaware. To the extent that the Corporation  maintains
any policy or policies providing such insurance, each such current or former
director, officer or employee, and each such agent or fiduciary to which
rights of indemnification have been provided pursuant to paragraph (H) of
this  Section 6.5, shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance
with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage thereunder for
any such current or former director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary.

employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the  Corporation's

any director or officer or other employee of the Corporation arising pursuant
to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or the 
Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws (as either may be
amended from time to time), or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the
Corporation or any director or officer or other employee of the Corporation
governed by  the internal affairs doctrine shall be a state court located
within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State
