      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of June 28, 2007 (this "Agreement"),
by and among Western Digital Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
State M Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent ("Sub"), and Komag, Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

      WHEREAS Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

      WHEREAS, in furtherance of the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Parent proposes
to cause Sub to make a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as
permitted under this Agreement, the "Offer") to purchase all the outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company
Common Stock"), at a price per share of Company Common Stock of $32.25 (such
amount, or any other amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer and this
Agreement, the "Offer Price"), net to the seller in cash, without interest, on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

      WHEREAS the Boards of Directors of each of the Company, Parent and Sub
have each unanimously approved the Offer and the merger of Sub with and into the
Company (the "Merger"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement;

      WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and
the Merger; and

      WHEREAS concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as a condition to the willingness of Parent to enter into this Agreement,
certain stockholders of the Company are entering into an agreement with Parent
in substantially the form attached as Exhibit B hereto pursuant to which such
stockholders shall agree, among other things, to tender their shares of Company
Common Stock into the Offer (the "Voting and Tender Agreement").

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                    The Offer

      SECTION 1.01. The Offer. (a) Subject to the conditions of this Agreement
and the proviso in the first sentence of Section 1.02(b), as promptly as
practicable (but in no event later than 10 business days) after the date of this
Agreement, Sub shall, and Parent
<PAGE>

                                                                               2

shall cause Sub to, commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act"), the Offer; provided
that, if the Company is unable to file the Schedule 14D-9 on the same day Parent
is prepared to commence the Offer, then such 10-business day period shall be
tolled until such time as the Company is prepared to file the Schedule 14D-9
with the SEC. The obligations of Sub to, and of Parent to cause Sub to, accept
for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant
to the Offer shall be subject only to the conditions set forth in Exhibit A (the
"Offer Conditions"). The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be midnight,
New York City time, on the 20th business day immediately following the
commencement of the Offer (determined pursuant to Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the
Exchange Act). Subject to applicable Law, Sub expressly reserves the right to,
in its sole discretion, waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition at any
time prior to the expiration of the Offer or modify the terms of the Offer;
provided, however, that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Sub
shall not (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the
Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) waive the Minimum Tender Condition or
the conditions to the Offer set forth in lettered paragraph (b) of Exhibit A or
numbered paragraph (i) of Exhibit A, (iv) add to the conditions set forth in
Exhibit A or modify any Offer Condition (other than as required by Law, the SEC
or its Staff in a manner that is not adverse to the holders of Company Common
Stock), (v) except as otherwise provided in this Section 1.01(a), extend the
Offer, (vi) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer or (vii)
otherwise amend the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of Company Common
Stock or any manner that would result in any mandatory extension of the Offer
(other than an increase in the Offer Price in response to an Acquisition
Proposal). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: (A) in
the event that any of the Offer Conditions (including the Minimum Tender
Condition or any of the other Offer Conditions set forth in Exhibit A) is not
satisfied or waived (if permitted hereunder) as of immediately prior to the
expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended from time to time pursuant to and
in accordance with this Section 1.01(a)), Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub
to, extend the Offer for successive extension periods of up to 10 business days
each (or (x) any longer period as may be mutually agreed by Parent and the
Company or (y) any shorter period ending on the Termination Date, if applicable)
in order to permit the satisfaction of all of the conditions to the Offer; and
(B) Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, extend the Offer for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the New York
Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") or the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer; provided, however, that Sub
shall not be required to (and Parent shall not be required to cause Sub to)
extend the Offer beyond the Termination Date. On the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Sub to, accept and pay for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Sub becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer promptly (within the meaning of Section 14e-1(c)
promulgated under the Exchange Act) after the expiration date of the Offer (as
it may be extended from time to time pursuant to and in accordance with this

<PAGE>

                                                                               3

Section 1.01(a)). Acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Closing",
and the time at which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement
as the "Offer Closing Time". Sub expressly reserves the right to, in its sole
discretion, provide for a "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule
14d-11 under the Exchange Act, and the Offer Documents shall provide for such a
reservation of right.

      (b) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect
of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or
after the date hereof and prior to the Offer Closing in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

      (c) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Sub shall file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer,
which shall contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal and
summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein
pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or
amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents"). The Company shall furnish to Parent
and Sub all information concerning the Company required by the Exchange Act to
be set forth in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall
promptly correct any information supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and each of
Parent and Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer
Documents and to cause the Offer Documents as so amended or supplemented to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities Laws, the
SEC or its staff or the NYSE. Parent and Sub shall promptly notify the Company
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements, to the Offer Documents, and shall provide the Company
with copies of all correspondence between them and their representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Unless the Board of Directors of the
Company has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, prior to the filing of
the Offer Documents (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC
or dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to
any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Sub
shall provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
Offer Documents or response (including the proposed final version thereof).

      (d) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Sub on a timely basis
the funds necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock that Sub
becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for, pursuant to the Offer.

                                                                               4

      (e) Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock such amounts as Sub is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority by Sub, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Sub.

      SECTION 1.02. Company Actions. (a) The Company hereby approves of and
consents to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

      (b) The Company file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement
on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, together with
any supplements or amendments thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9"), and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to file the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC on the date the
Offer Documents are filed with the SEC and mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the
stockholders of the Company with the Offer Documents. Parent and Sub shall
furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Sub required by the
Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent
and Sub shall promptly correct any information supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and
the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule
14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed
with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case
as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities Laws, the SEC or
its staff or the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Unless the Board of Directors of
the Company has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall
promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Schedule 14D-9, and
shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and
its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Unless the
Board of Directors of the Company has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change
(and except for any Schedule 14D-9 filing in which the Company discloses an
Adverse Recommendation Change), prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9
(including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or mailing thereof
to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall provide Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or response
(including the proposed final version thereof).

      (c) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall cause
its transfer agent to furnish Parent and Sub promptly with mailing labels
containing the

                                                                               5

names and addresses of the record holders of Company Common Stock
as of a recent date and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to
such date, together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position
listings and computer files and all other information in the Company's
possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common Stock,
and shall furnish to Sub such information and assistance (including updated
lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files) as Parent
may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to holders of Company Common
Stock. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps
as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent
and Sub shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels,
listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer
and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request,
deliver to the Company all copies of such information then in their possession
or control.

      (d) At any time after the Offer Closing Time, Parent may request the
Company to take all necessary actions, and the Company agrees to take such
actions, to deregister the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act and/or to
delist the Shares from the Nasdaq Global Select Market if (A) such actions are
otherwise permitted under applicable Law, and (B) such actions are reasonably
expected to permit the Closing to occur sooner than it would otherwise occur.

      (e) Unless the Board of Directors of the Company has effected an Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the
recommendation described in Section 4.01(d) in the Offer Documents. If the Board
of Directors of the Company has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change,
neither Sub nor Parent may include the recommendation described in Section
4.01(d) in the Offer Documents without the Company's prior written consent.
Unless the Board of Directors of the Company has effected an Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company shall include the recommendation described in
Section 4.01(d) in the Schedule 14D-9.

      SECTION 1.03. Top-Up Option. (a) The Company hereby grants to Sub an
irrevocable option (the "Top-Up Option"), exercisable only on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Section 1.03, to purchase at a price per share
equal to the Offer Price paid in the Offer that number of newly issued shares of
Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up Shares") equal to the lowest number of shares
of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent at the time of exercise of
the Top-Up Option shall constitute one share more than 90% of the shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up
Shares; provided, however, that the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable for a
number of shares of Company Common Stock in excess of the shares of Company
Common Stock authorized and unissued at the time of exercise of the Top-Up
Option. Provided that no applicable law, rule, regulation, order, injunction or
other legal impediment shall make the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the
issuance of the Top-Up

                                                                               6

Option Shares pursuant thereto illegal, the Top-Up Option
shall be exercisable at any time following the Offer Closing and prior to the
earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms. Sub may only exercise the Top-Up Option
on a single occasion after the expiration of the Offer and in any case only if,
as a result of and immediately following the issuance of the Top-Up Shares,
Parent will directly or indirectly hold one share more than 90% of the shares of
Company Common Stock then outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance of
the Top-Up Shares).

      (b) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery
of the Top-Up Shares comply with all applicable Law, including compliance with
an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the
Securities Act. In the event Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Sub shall
give the Company one business day prior written notice, specifying (i) the
number of shares of the Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by
Parent at the time of such notice and (ii) a place and a time for the closing of
such purchase. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of
such notice, deliver written notice to Sub specifying, based on the information
provided by Sub in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares. At the closing of
the purchase of Top-Up Shares, the purchase price owed by Sub to the Company
therefor shall be paid to the Company (i) in an amount of cash equal to the
aggregate par value of the Top-Up Shares, by wire transfer or cashier's check,
and (ii) by issuance by Sub to the Company of a promissory note in the form of
Exhibit C with a principal amount equal to the remaining exercise price of the
Top-Up Shares. Parent and Sub understand that the shares of Company Common Stock
which Sub will acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered
under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption
thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Sub
represent and warrant to the Company that Sub is, or will be upon the purchase
of the Top-Up Shares, an Accredited Investor within the meaning of Rule 501 of
Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. Sub agrees that the Top-Up
Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are not being acquired
with a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within
the meaning of the Securities Act.

                                                                               7

      SECTION 2.02. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place at 5:30 a.m., California time, on a date to be specified by the parties,
which shall be not later than the second business day after satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, at the offices of O'Melveny &
Myers LLP, 610 Newport Center Drive, 17th Floor, Newport Beach, California
92660, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and
the Company; provided, however, that if all the conditions set forth in Article
VII shall not have been satisfied or waived on such second business day, then
the Closing shall take place on the first business day on which all such
conditions shall have been satisfied or waived. The date on which the Closing
occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date".

      SECTION 2.03. Effective Time of the Merger. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the
Closing Date, the parties shall file a certificate of merger (the "Certificate
of Merger") in such form as is required by, and executed and acknowledged in
accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at such date and time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such subsequent date and
time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of
Merger. The date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to
in this Agreement as the "Effective Time".

      SECTION 2.04. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the DGCL.

      SECTION 2.05. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. (a) Subject to the
terms of Section 6.05(a), the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
of the Company (the "Company Certificate") shall be amended at the Effective
Time to read in the form of Exhibit D hereto and, as so amended, the Company
Certificate shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

      (b) Subject to the terms of Section 6.05(a), the Bylaws of Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or
by applicable Law.

      SECTION 2.06. Directors. The directors of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are
duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

      SECTION 2.07. Officers. The officers of Sub immediately prior to the

                                                                               8

      SECTION 2.08. Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, following the Offer Closing
Time, Parent or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent shall own at least
90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, pursuant to the Offer or
otherwise (including as a result of the exercise of the Top-Up Option and the
issuance of the Top-Up Shares pursuant thereto), the parties hereto shall,
subject to Article VII hereof, take all necessary and appropriate action to
cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after the
satisfaction of such threshold, without a meeting of stockholders of the
Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

                                  ARTICLE III

   Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations;
                            Exchange of Certificates

      SECTION 3.01. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock, or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Sub:

      (a) Capital Stock of Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of common
stock of Sub, par value $0.01 per share, shall be converted into and become one
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

      (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent- and Sub-Owned Stock. All
shares of Company Common Stock that are owned as treasury stock by the Company
or owned by Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

      (c) Company Subsidiary-Owned Shares. Each share of Company Common Stock
that is owned, directly or indirectly, by any Company Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such number of shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Company Subsidiary
owns the same percentage of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

      (d) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i)
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.01(b) and (ii) except as
provided in Section 3.01(e), the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the
right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, in cash and without interest,
the Offer Price paid in the Offer (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective
Time such shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares

<PAGE>

                                                                               9

(a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. The right of any holder of any share of Company Common Stock to
receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount
of any withholding that is required under applicable tax Law, such withholding
to be pursuant to the terms of Section 3.02(f) and any applicable tax Law.

      (e) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (the "Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder
who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant
to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation, in cash and without interest, the Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 3.01(d), but instead such holder shall be entitled to
payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262. At the Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such
holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the
right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section
262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's
Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall
be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have
become, the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, in cash and without
interest, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.01(d). The Company
shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares
of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of any such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the
foregoing.

      SECTION 3.02. Exchange of Certificates. (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the "Paying Agent"), and, promptly
after the Effective Time (and from time to time thereafter, if necessary),
Parent shall make available, or cause the Surviving Corporation to make
available, to the Paying Agent funds in amounts and at the times necessary for
the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.01(d) upon
surrender of Certificates, it being understood that any and all interest or
other amounts earned with respect to funds made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to this Agreement shall be turned over to Parent.

<PAGE>

                                                                              10

      (b) Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail
to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of
cash equal to the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 3.01(d), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the Company, payment of
the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be made to a person other than
the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall
be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

      (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All cash paid
upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Article
III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time
occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the close of business on the day on which the
Effective Time occurs, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article III.

      (d) No Liability. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any
cash that would otherwise have been payable in respect of any Certificate which
is delivered to a public official in accordance with any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have been
surrendered prior to two years after the Effective

<PAGE>

                                                                              11

Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger
Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

      (e) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay the Merger Consideration in
respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate.

      (f) Withholding Rights. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration or
other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

      (g) Termination of Fund. At any time following the date six months after
the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest or
other amounts earned with respect thereto) that had been made available to the
Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and
thereafter, subject to time limitations in Section 3.01(d), such holders shall
be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to
the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of
any Certificates held by such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement,
without any interest thereon.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                         Representations and Warranties

      SECTION 4.01. Representations and Warranties of the Company. Except as set
forth in the letter delivered by the Company to Parent at least three business
days prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Company Letter") (it being
understood that any information set forth in one section or subsection of the
Company Letter shall be deemed

<PAGE>

                                                                              12

to apply to and qualify the section or subsection of this Agreement to which it
corresponds in number and each other section or subsection of this Agreement to
which the relevance of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face), the
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as follows:

      (a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (i) is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization (except, in the case of good standing, for entities organized under
the Laws of any jurisdiction that does not recognize such concept), (ii) has all
requisite corporate or company power and authority to carry on its business as
now being conducted and as proposed by the Company to be conducted and (iii) is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction (except, in the case of good standing, any jurisdiction that does
not recognize such concept) in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary or desirable, other than where the failure to be so
organized, existing, qualified or licensed or in good standing (except, in the
case of clause (i) above, with respect to the Company) would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to
Parent complete and correct copies of the Company Certificate and the Amended
and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the "Company Bylaws") and the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of each of its
Subsidiaries, in each case as amended to the date of this Agreement. The Company
has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the minutes (or, in
the case of draft minutes, the most recent drafts thereof) of all meetings of
the stockholders, the Board of Directors and each committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries held since January 1,
2004. The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of
all resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company, and each committee
thereof, in respect of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

      (b) Subsidiaries. Section 4.01(b) of the Company Letter sets forth a
complete and correct list of each Subsidiary of the Company and its place and
form of organization. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, each such Subsidiary are owned by the Company, by
another wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or by the Company and another
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of all pledges, claims,
liens, options, security interests or other encumbrances of any kind or nature
whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"), except for transfer restrictions imposed by
applicable securities Laws, and are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable. Except for the capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, its Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, any
person, except for non-controlling investments made in the ordinary course of
business.

      (c) Capital Structure. (i) The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 120,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock. At the close of business
on June 27, 2007, (A) 30,359,747 shares of Company Common Stock (excluding
treasury shares but including 1,036,090 shares subject to vesting) were issued
and outstanding, (B) no shares of Company Common Stock were held by the Company
as treasury shares, (C) 617,302 shares of Company Common Stock were subject to
outstanding options to acquire shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Company's Amended and Restated 2002 Qualified Stock Plan (the "Company Stock
Plan") (such options, together with any other stock options granted after June
26, 2007, under the Company Stock Plans pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
or as disclosed in the Company Letter, the "Company Stock Options"), (D) 12,500
shares of Company Common Stock were subject to outstanding stock purchase rights
under the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan and the Company Stock Plan (such
stock purchase rights, together with any other stock purchase rights granted
after June 26, 2007, under the Company Stock Plan pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement or as disclosed in the Company Letter, the "Company Stock Purchase
Rights"), and (E) the Company's outstanding 2.125% Convertible Subordinated
Notes due 2014 of the Company (the "Company Convertible Notes") issued pursuant
to the Indenture, dated as of March 28, 2007, by and between the Company and
U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Indenture") are in the
aggregate convertible into a maximum of 7,631,250 shares of Company Common
Stock. An aggregate of 4,942,762 shares of Company Common Stock are reserved for
future issuance pursuant to the Company Stock Plan. Other than the Company Stock
Plan, there is no plan or other Contract providing for the grant of options
exercisable for or into shares of Company Common Stock by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. No shares of Company Common Stock are owned by any Subsidiary
of the Company. The Company has delivered to Parent (1) a complete, correct and
accurate list, as of the close of business on June 26, 2007, of all outstanding
Company Stock Options and Company Stock Purchase Rights, the number of shares
subject to each such Company Stock Option and Company Stock Purchase Right, the
grant date, exercise price per share, vesting schedule and expiration date of

The Contracts of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the type referred to

Contracts". The Company has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy
of each of the Specified Contracts, including all amendments thereto. Each
Specified Contract is in full force and effect (except for those Contracts that

agreement of the Company or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, of each other party thereto, enforceable against the
Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and, to the knowledge of the
Company, against the other party or parties thereto, in each case, in accordance
with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
Laws relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or

have a Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, there has
occurred no event giving (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) to
others any right of termination, material amendment or cancellation of any
Specified Contract.

            (ii) None of the Major Customers or Major Suppliers has terminated,

similar authorizations from any Governmental Entity (collectively, "Permits")
that are necessary for them to own, lease or operate their properties and assets
and to carry on their businesses as currently conducted, except where the
failure to have any such Permits would not reasonably be expected, individually
or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and compliance
with the terms hereof, would not reasonably be expected to cause the revocation
or cancellation of any Permit, the revocation or cancellation of which would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to result in material liability to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is, and since January
1, 2004 has been, in compliance in all respects with all applicable Laws and
Judgments. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written communication during the past three years from any person that alleges
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is not in compliance in all material
respects with, or is subject to liability under, any Permit, Law or Judgment or
relating to the revocation or modification of any material Permit. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice that any
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity is pending with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the assets or operations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and to the knowledge of the Company, no such
investigation or review has been threatened.

      qualified for "Pioneer Status" from the government of Malaysia for the
      Company's thin-film media venture in Malaysia, and such status is in full
      force and effect. Such Subsidiary is, and since January 1, 2004 has been,
      in compliance in all material respects with the requirements to maintain
      such status, and no condition or state of facts exists that could
      reasonably be expected to give rise to a loss of such status. Neither the
      Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written communication
      that alleges that, and there is not grounds the Company or any of its
      Subsidiaries is not in compliance in all material respects with, or is
      subject to liability under, such status.

      bargaining agreements or other labor union Contracts to which the Company
      or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound.
      Since January 1, 2006, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
      encountered any actual or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
      labor union organizing activity. Since January 1, 2004, there has been no
      actual or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened strikes, work
      stoppages, slowdowns or lockouts with respect to any employees of the
      Company or any of its Subsidiaries. None of the employees of the Company
      or any of its Subsidiaries is represented by any union with respect to his
      or her employment by the Company or such Subsidiary. There are no unfair
      labor practice complaints pending, or, to the knowledge of the Company,
      threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case
      before the National Labor Relations Board or any comparable Governmental
      Entity, except as would not reasonably be expected to result in material
      liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

      relations, plant closures and layoffs, immigration, workers' compensation,
      employee leave issues, unemployment insurance, and the payment of social
      security and other taxes, except as would not reasonably be expected to
      result in material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
      a whole. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has properly classified
      (i) employees as exempt from applicable overtime Laws and (ii) consultants
      as independent contractors under applicable Tax reporting, withholding and
      related laws, except as would not reasonably be expected to result in
      material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
      No claim, action, suit or judicial, administrative or regulatory
      proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
      against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries based on any alleged
      material violation of any employment Laws or Contracts.

      transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination with
      any other event) and compliance by the Company with the provisions of this
      Agreement do not and will not (A) trigger any funding (through a grantor

      obligation under, any Benefit Plan or any other employment arrangement,
      (B) trigger the forgiveness of indebtedness owed by any Company Personnel

      the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors,
      officers or employees or, to the knowledge of the Company, any trustee or
      other fiduciary or administrator of any Benefit Plan or trust created
      thereunder, in each case, who is not a director, officer or employee of

            (xi) Except as set forth on Section 4.01(m)(xi) of the Company
      Letter, no Benefit Plan is maintained outside the jurisdiction of the
      United States, or covers any employee residing or working outside the
      United States (any such Benefit Plan, a "Foreign Benefit Plan"). With
      respect to any Foreign Benefit Plan, (A) all Foreign Benefit Plan have
      been established, maintained and administered in compliance in all
      material respects with their terms and all applicable statutes, laws,
      ordinances, rules, orders, decrees, judgments, writs, and regulations of
      any controlling Governmental Authority, (B) all Foreign Benefit Plan that
      are required to be funded are fully funded, and with respect to all other
      Foreign Benefit Plan, adequate reserves therefor have been established on
      the Closing Statement, and (C) no material liability or obligation of the
      Company or its Subsidiaries exists with respect to such Foreign Benefit
      Plan that has not been disclosed on Section 4.01(m)(xi) of the Company
      Letter.

            (xii) To the Company's knowledge, each Benefit Plan that is a

      respects since January 1, 2005 in good faith compliance with Section 409A
      of the Code and all applicable IRS guidance promulgated thereunder to the
      extent such plan is subject to Section 409A of the Code, and (2) as to any
      such plan in existence prior to January 1, 2005 and not subject to Section
      409A of the Code, has not been "materially modified" (within the meaning
      of IRS Notice 2005-1) at any time after October 3, 2004. No Company Stock
      Option (whether currently outstanding or previously exercised) is, has
      been or would be, as applicable, subject to any tax, penalty or interest
      under Section 409A of the Code.

            (n) Taxes. (i) Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect,
each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has timely filed all tax returns
required to be filed by it, and all such tax returns are true, complete and
correct in all material respects. Except as would not have a Material Adverse
Effect, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has timely paid or accrued in
accordance with GAAP, whether or not shown on any tax return, all taxes due and
owing, and the most recent financial statements contained in the Filed SEC
Documents reflect an adequate reserve for all taxes payable by the Company and
its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date
of such financial statements.

            (ii) No material tax return of the Company or any of its
      Subsidiaries is currently under audit or examination by any taxing
      authority, and no written notice of an audit or examination has been
      received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no existing
      or threatened in writing, deficiency, refund litigation, proposed
      adjustment or matter in controversy with respect to any material taxes due
      and owing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Each deficiency
      resulting from any completed audit or examination or concluded litigation
      relating to material taxes by any taxing authority has been timely paid.
      The relevant statute of limitations is closed with respect to the income
      tax returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all years through
      1999. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been informed in
      writing by any jurisdiction that the jurisdiction believes that the
      Company or any of its Subsidiaries was required to file any material tax
      return that was not filed.

            (iii) No Liens for material taxes exist with respect to any assets
      or properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for Liens
      for taxes not yet due or that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
      contesting in good faith through appropriate proceedings and for which
      adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP.

            (iv) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
      bound by or currently has any material liability under any tax sharing

      practice with respect to taxes (including any advance pricing agreement,
      closing agreement (including pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code) or
      other agreement relating to taxes with any taxing authority). Neither the
      Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a member of an affiliated
      group filing a consolidated, combined, or unitary income tax return (other
      than a group the common parent of which was the Company). Neither the
      Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability for the
      Taxes of any person (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) under
      Treasury Regulation 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
      foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.

            (v) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required
      to include any material item of income in, or exclude a material item of
      deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period ending after the
      Effective Time, as a result of any (A) change in method of accounting for
      a prior taxable period under Code Section 481(c) (or any corresponding or
      similar provision under state, local, or foreign tax law), or (B) deferred
      intercompany gain or excess loss account described in Treasury regulations
      promulgated under Section 1502 of the Code (or any corresponding or
      similar provisions under state, local or foreign tax law).

            (vi) There is no Contract, plan or arrangement to which the Company
      or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective affiliates is a
      party as of the date of this Agreement, including the provisions of this
      Agreement, covering any employee or former employee of the Company or any
      of its Subsidiaries that, individually or collectively, would reasonably
      be expected to give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be
      deductible pursuant to Sections 280G, 404 or 162(m) of the Code. There is
      no Contract, plan or arrangement to which the Company or any of its
      Subsidiaries or any of its or their affiliates is a party or by which it
      is bound to compensate any individual for excise taxes paid pursuant to
      Section 4999 of the Code.

            (vii) Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, the
      Company and its Subsidiaries have complied with all applicable Laws
      relating to the payment and withholding of taxes (including withholding of

      corporation" (A) in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free
      treatment under Section 355 of the Code in the two years prior to the date
      of this Agreement or (B) in a distribution that could otherwise constitute
      part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning
      of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the Merger or any of
      the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

            (ix) Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, (A) all
      related party transactions involving the Company or any of its
      Subsidiaries are at arm's length in compliance with Section 482 of the
      Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and any
      comparable provision of any tax Law, (B) none of the Company or any of its
      Subsidiaries is or has been a party a party to any cost-sharing agreement
      or similar arrangement that is not a "qualified cost sharing arrangement"

      Subsidiaries has maintained all necessary documentation in connection with
      such related party transactions in accordance with Sections 482 and 6662
      of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and any

      participated in any "listed transaction", as defined in Treasury
      Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(2), required to be reported in a disclosure
      statement pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(a).

            (xii) The Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material
      respects with all conditions and requirements through the Effective Time
      necessary for maintaining tax exemptions and reductions pursuant to its
      agreements with Malaysian taxing authorities. The Company and its
      Subsidiaries reasonably expect that such conditions and requirements would
      be met in all material respects for the year ending December 31, 2007 if
      the transactions contemplated by this Agreement were not consummated.

            (xiii) For purposes of this Agreement, (A) "taxes" shall include all

properties and tangible assets leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
are free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Liens and Liens imposed on
the underlying fee interest in leased property. The material properties and

      Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted. With respect to each
      Leased Real Property, (A) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
      has subleased, licensed or otherwise granted anyone the right to use or
      occupy such Leased Real Property or any portion thereof and (B) neither

      granted any other security interest in any such leasehold estate or any
      interest therein.

            (iii) Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in
      the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect, each of the Company and

      or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, and, to the knowledge of the
      Company, of each other party thereto, enforceable against the Company or
      such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and, to the knowledge of the

      moratorium or other similar Laws relating to the enforcement of creditors'
      rights generally and by general principles of equity.

      valid title to all of the Owned Real Property, free and clear of all
      Liens, other than Permitted Liens, zoning, entitlement, building and other
      land use regulations imposed by Governmental Entities having jurisdiction
      over the Owned Real Property which are not violated by the current use and
      operation thereof and covenants, conditions, restrictions, easements and
      other similar matters of record affecting title to the Owned Real Property
      which are not violated by the current use and operation thereof. Neither
      the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (I) subleased, licensed or
      otherwise granted anyone the right to use or occupy any Owned Real
      Property or any portion thereof, or (II) collaterally assigned or granted

      (e) Sufficient Funds. At the Offer Closing, Sub will have sufficient funds
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the
Merger, to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to pay all related
fees and expenses.

      (f) Financing. Parent has provided to the Company a true and complete copy
of a fully executed debt commitment letter, dated as of the date of this
Agreement (the "Debt Commitment Letter") pursuant to which, and subject to the
terms and conditions thereof, Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. has committed
to provide Sub with loans in the amounts described therein, the proceeds of
which are to be used to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and pay related fees and expenses (the
"Financing"). The Debt Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Parent and Sub and, to Parent's knowledge, the
other parties thereto. As of this date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment
Letter is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn, rescinded or
terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect. The proceeds funded
under the Debt Commitment Letter, when funded in accordance with the Debt
Commitment Letter, together with cash and cash equivalents currently held by
Parent and its wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiaries, will constitute all
of the funds required to enable Parent and Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, and the fulfill their
respective obligations hereunder. The Debt Commitment Letter contains all of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of the lenders thereunder to make the
Financing available to Parent and Sub on the terms therein. As of the date of
this Agreement, to the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default on
the part of Parent or Sub under any term or condition of the Debt Commitment
Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Sub has any reason
to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or
condition to be satisfied by it in the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent has fully
paid any and all commitment fees that have been incurred and are due and payable
in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter, and Parent will pay when due all
other commitment fees arising under the Debt Commitment Letter when due and
payable.

      (g) Litigation. There is no claim, action, suit, arbitration, alternative
dispute resolution action or any other judicial or administrative proceeding
pending against (or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against or naming as
a party thereto) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of
Parent, is there any investigation pending or threatened against Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, in each case, which would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to impair in any material respect the ability
of each of Parent and Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
prevent or materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Offer,
the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

      (h) Ownership of Company Capital Stock. Neither Parent nor Sub is, nor at
any time during the last three (3) years has it been, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL (other than as

this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its subsidiaries
operations.

       SECTION 5.02. No Solicitation. (a) Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any director, officer,
employee,

<PAGE>
                                                                              48

investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative
(collectively, "Representatives") of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly (and it shall instruct, and cause each of its
Subsidiaries to instruct, each Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries not to), (i) solicit, initiate or encourage, or knowingly
facilitate, any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or
(ii) enter into or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any person (or any representative thereof) any
information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with any person
(or any representative thereof) with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal;
provided, however, that if, at any time prior to the Offer Closing, the Company
receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith either constitutes, or is reasonably likely
to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and which Acquisition Proposal did not result
from a breach of this Section 5.02(a), the Company may, and may authorize and
permit any of its Subsidiaries and any director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any investment banker, attorney,
accountant or other advisor or representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, in each case subject to compliance with Section 5.02(c) and the
other provisions of this Agreement, (A) furnish information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition Proposal (and
its advisors and representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement which
contains terms that are no less restrictive (in all but de minimis respects) to
such person than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement dated June 13,
2007 between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the
"Confidentiality Agreement") and that allows for the Company to comply with its
obligations pursuant to this Section 5.02 (including the notification provisions
of Section 5.02(b) and (c)), provided that all such information has been
provided, or is concurrently provided, to Parent, and (B) enter into or
otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such
Acquisition Proposal (and its advisors and representatives) regarding such
Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is
understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding
sentence by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall
be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.02(a) by the Company.

      For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Acquisition Proposal" means any
proposal or offer from any person (other than Parent or Sub or any of their
affiliates) relating to any direct or indirect acquisition, in one transaction
or a series of transactions, including by way of any merger, consolidation,
tender offer, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, binding
share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture, license agreement or similar transaction, of (i)
assets or businesses that constitute, represent or generate 15% or more of the
total revenue, net income, EBITDA or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (ii) 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock or of any class of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, one or more of the Subsidiaries of the Company which, in the
aggregate, directly or indirectly, hold the assets or businesses referred to in
clause (i) above.

                                                                              49

      For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Superior Proposal" means any
binding bona fide written offer, which did not result from a breach of Section
5.02(a), made by any person (other than Parent or Sub or any of their
affiliates) for a transaction that, if consummated, would result in such person
(or in the case of a direct merger between such person and the Company, the
stockholders of such person) acquiring, directly or indirectly, a majority of
the voting power of the Company Common Stock or all or substantially all the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that, in the
good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and after taking into
account all of the terms and conditions and other characteristics of such
proposal, including (A) the probability of, and time necessary to achieve,
consummation of such proposal, and (B) all financial, legal, regulatory and
other aspects of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the
terms of the Offer or this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such
Superior Proposal or otherwise)) is more favorable from a financial point of
view to the stockholders of the Company (in their capacity as such) than the
Offer and the Merger, taken together.

      (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the
recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any
such committee of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger, or recommend, or
propose publicly to recommend, the approval or adoption of any Acquisition
Proposal, or resolve or agree to take any such action (any such action,
resolution or agreement to take such action being referred to herein as an
"Adverse Recommendation Change"), (ii) adopt or approve any Acquisition
Proposal, or propose the approval or adoption of any Acquisition Proposal, or
resolve or agree to take any such action, or (iii) cause or permit the Company
to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (each, an
"Acquisition Agreement") constituting or related to, or which is intended to or
is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.02(a)), or resolve or agree
to take any such action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the
Offer Closing, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in response to a
Superior Proposal, effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or cause the
Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e) to enter into a
definitive agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal with a third party if the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably be
expected to be a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law; provided, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, (A) the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section

<PAGE>
                                                                              50

8.01(e), and any purported termination pursuant to Section 8.01(e) shall be void
and of no force and effect, unless the Company shall have complied in all
material respects with all the provisions of this Section 5.02 in connection
with such Superior Proposal (including the notification provisions of this
Section 5.02(b)) and with all applicable requirements of Section 6.06(b)
(including payment of the Termination Fee prior to or concurrently with such
termination) in connection with such Superior Proposal, and (B) the Board of
Directors of the Company may not effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e) unless (I) the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to
Parent (an "Adverse Recommendation Change Notice") that it is prepared to effect
an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal and/or cause
the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e) to enter
into a definitive agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal with a third
party, which notice shall attach the definitive form of written agreement
relating to the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal, and (II)
Parent does not make, within five business days after the receipt of such
notice, a proposal that would, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Company (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel), cause the offer previously constituting a Superior
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal. The Company agrees that,
during the five business day period prior to its effecting an Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(e) to enter into a definitive agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal
with a third party, the Company and its officers, directors and representatives
shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its officers, directors, and
representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent.

      (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Sections
5.02(a) and 5.02(b), the Company shall, as promptly as practicable and in any
event within one business day after the receipt thereof, notify Parent of (i)
any Acquisition Proposal or any request for information or inquiry that the
Company reasonably believes could lead to or contemplates an Acquisition
Proposal and (ii) the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry (including any subsequent amendment or other
modification to such terms and conditions) and the identity of the person making
any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company shall (as
promptly as practicable and in any event within one business day notify Parent
of any material change or other material development with respect to any such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, including material amendments or
proposed amendments as to price and other material terms thereof. The Company
shall provide Parent with at least 48 hours prior notice of any meeting of the
Board of Directors of the Company (or such lesser notice as is provided to such
Board of Directors generally) at which the Company Board is reasonably expected
to consider any Acquisition Proposal.

      (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or otherwise making any statements or disclosing any information to
its stockholders that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) to make or disclose in
order to fulfill its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however,
that in no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee
thereof take, agree or resolve to take any action prohibited by Section 5.02(b);
provided further that any "stop, look and listen" communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall be deemed in
compliance with the terms of Section 5.02(b) and shall not be deemed an Adverse
Recommendation Change in the event that it includes an express reaffirmation of
the Board of Directors of the Company's recommendation set forth in Section
4.02.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                              Additional Agreements

      SECTION 6.01. Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting.
(a) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders is required
by applicable Law, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable following the
Offer Closing and the expiration of any "subsequent offering period" provided by
Parent pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, prepare and file with
the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Company's stockholders as promptly as practicable after such filing. Each of the
Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning such person to the
other as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing
and distribution of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent
with copies of all correspondence between it and its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Each of the Company and Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent an opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response (including the proposed final version of
such document or response) and (ii) shall include in such document or response
all comments reasonably proposed by Parent. If, at any time prior to the
Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of
their respective affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers

<PAGE>
                                                                              52

such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company.

      (b) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders is
required by applicable Law, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable
following the Offer Closing and the expiration of any "subsequent offering
period" provided by Parent pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, establish a record date (which will be as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the Offer Closing and the expiration of any "subsequent
offering period" provided by Parent pursuant to and in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement) for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its stockholders (the "Stockholders Meeting"), for the purpose of obtaining the
Stockholder Approval. The notice of such Stockholders Meeting shall state that a
resolution to adopt this Agreement will be considered at the Stockholders
Meeting. Subject to Section 5.02(b)(i), the Board of Directors of the Company
shall recommend to holders of the Company Common Stock that they adopt this
Agreement, and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Parent, Sub and their
respective Subsidiaries and affiliates shall hold, in the aggregate, at least
90% of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock entitled to vote on
adoption of this Agreement under the DGCL and other applicable Law following the
Offer Closing and the expiration of any "subsequent offering period" provided by
Parent pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, if applicable, and the
exercise of the Top-Up Option, if applicable, the parties hereto shall take all
necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon
as practicable without the Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 253
of the DGCL.

      (c) Parent agrees to cause all shares of Company Common Stock acquired
pursuant to the Offer and all other shares of Company Common Stock owned by
Parent or any subsidiary of Parent to be voted in favor of the Stockholder
Approval and to deliver or provide, in its capacity as a stockholder of the
Company, any other approvals that are required by the DGCL and any other
applicable Law to effect the Merger in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

      SECTION 6.02. Access to Information; Confidentiality. The Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to Parent's
officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants and
other representatives and advisors reasonable access upon reasonable advance
notice and during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement to all their respective properties,
assets, books, records, Contracts, Permits, documents, information, directors,
officers and employees, and during such period the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish to Parent any information concerning
its business as Parent may reasonably request

<PAGE>
                                                                              53

(including the work papers of KPMG LLP). Following the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Effective Time, Parent may (but shall not be required to),
following reasonable notice to the Company, contact and interview any Company
Personnel and review the personnel records and such other information concerning
the Company Personnel as Parent may reasonably request. No investigation by
Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives and no other receipt
of information by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives
shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation or warranty of
the Company or any covenant or other provision in this Agreement. Except as
required by any applicable Law or Judgment, Parent will hold, and will direct
its officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
advisors and representatives to hold, any and all information received from the
Company confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the Company shall not be required to provide the foregoing access to
Parent or to Parent's officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, consultants and other representatives or advisors, or to disclose
any information Parent or to Parent's officers, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants, consultants or other representatives and advisors, in
any case pursuant to this Section 6.02 or otherwise, if (i) such access or
disclosure would cause a loss, waiver or impairment of the attorney-client
privilege of the Company or its Subsidiaries (it being understood that the
parties shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be
provided in a manner that does not result in such loss, waiver or impairment,
which reasonable best efforts shall include entering into one or more joint
defense or community of interest agreements on customary terms if counsels to
the parties reasonably conclude that such agreements are likely to preserve the
privilege), or (ii) if the Company determines, after consultation with Parent
and considering the advice of the Company's outside counsel, that such access or
disclosure would violate any Law or Judgment applicable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or breach or otherwise violate any Contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to get consents from the counter-parties to any such Contracts in
order to allow the Company to disclose confidential information to Parent and
its officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants
and other representatives or advisors.

      SECTION 6.03. Reasonable Best Efforts; Consultation and Notice. (a) Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including: (i) using reasonable best efforts to satisfy the
conditions precedent set forth in Exhibit A and Article VII, (ii) using
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from, and the giving

<PAGE>
                                                                              54

of any necessary notices to, Governmental Entities and other persons and the
making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including
filings under the HSR Act and other registrations, declarations and filings
with, or notices to, Governmental Entities, if any), (iii) coordinating and
cooperating with, and giving due consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested by the other party in connection with, making (A)
any filing under or with respect to the HSR Act, any other antitrust,
competition, merger control or similar Law or any other applicable Laws and (B)
any filings, conferences or other submissions related to resolving any
investigation or other inquiry by any Governmental Entity, (iv) using reasonable
best efforts to provide any supplemental information requested by a Governmental
Entity, including participating in meetings with officials of such entity in the
course of its review of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (v) using reasonable best efforts
to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any
Governmental Entity or other person, and (vi) litigating or participating in the
litigation of any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding, whether
judicial or administrative, brought by any Governmental Entity for the purpose
of enabling the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, on the terms and conditions set forth
herein. In connection with and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each of the Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover
statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this
Agreement or any of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby
or thereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on
this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or Sub be obligated to, and
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not agree with a Governmental Entity
without the prior written consent of Parent, to divest or hold separate, or
enter into any licensing or similar arrangement with respect to, any material
assets (whether tangible or intangible) or any material portion of any business
of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (any such action,
an "Action of Divestiture").

      (b) (i) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, the Company shall promptly
notify Parent in writing:

              (A) that any representation or warranty made by the Company in
   this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate, or of any failure of the
   Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
   complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in any such case if
   and only to the extent that such untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure,
   would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the
   obligations of Parent and Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated
   hereby set forth in numbered paragraph (ii) of Exhibit A to fail to be
   satisfied at the then scheduled expiration of the Offer;

<PAGE>
                                                                              55

              (B) when any of the Company's directors or executive officers
   become aware that any person (other than a Governmental Entity) has alleged
   that the consent of such person is required in connection with the Offer, the
   Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

              (C) when any of the Company's directors or executive officers
   become aware that any customer, distributor or reseller is terminating its
   relationship with Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the
   Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
   Agreement;

              (D) when any of the Company's directors or executive officers
   become aware of any material notice or other material communication from any
   Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the
   other transactions contemplated hereby, and a copy of any such notice or
   communication shall be furnished to Parent together with the Company's
   written notice; and

              (E) when any of the Company's directors or executive officers
   become aware of any investigations by any Governmental Entity or any actions,
   suits or proceedings or material claims, in each case (I) commenced against
   the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (II) relating to the Company or any
   of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
   Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case that, if pending on the date of
   this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
   Section 4.01(h) or that relate to the consummation of the Offer, the Merger
   or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the parties (or remedies
with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under
this Agreement.

      (ii) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of (A) any
   representation or warranty made by Parent or Sub contained in this Agreement
   that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or any such
   representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue in any
   material respect or (B) the failure of Parent or Sub to perform in any
   material respect any obligation to be performed by such party under this
   Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the
   representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the
   parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
   obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

      (c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall
give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of any litigation
against the Company and/or its directors relating to the Offer, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and will obtain the prior
written consent of Parent prior to settling or satisfying any such claim, it
being understood and agreed that this Section 6.03(c) shall not give Parent the
right to direct such defense.

      (d) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of
the Offer Closing or the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article
VIII, the Company shall, at the request of Parent, use its reasonable best
efforts to identify and segregate any confidential information of third parties
in the possession of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the purpose of
facilitating the return to such third parties or destruction of such
confidential information as promptly as practicable after the Offer Closing;
provided that the Company shall not be required to take any action pursuant to
this undertaking that would cause a disruption in, or inability of, the Company
to manufacture its products.

      SECTION 6.04. Equity Awards. (a) At the Effective Time, each In-The-Money
Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be amended and converted into the right to receive, with the same vesting
schedule as was applicable to the Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to such
In-the-Money Company Stock Option, subject to the provisions of this Section
6.04, the Merger Consideration minus the exercise price per share of such
In-the-Money Company Stock Option (with respect to each such vested or unvested
Company Stock Option, the "Option Per Share Merger Consideration"). At the

Stock Options" as of the Effective Date shall be cancelled.

      (b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent

appropriate notices (the "Company Stock Option Notices") informing them that
each In-the-Money Company Stock Option has been converted into the right to
receive the Option Per Share Merger Consideration. Promptly after the vesting of
an In-the-Money Company Stock Option, Parent shall pay to such Company
Optionholder of a vested In-the-Money Company Stock Option the Option Per Share
Merger Consideration. Payment shall be made no later than the fifteenth (15th)
day after the end of the month in which the Company Optionholder's In-the-Money
Company Stock Option becomes vested.

      (c) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Purchase Right outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive, with the same vesting schedule and agreement as was applicable to the
Company Stock Purchase Right, subject to the provisions of this Section 6.04,
the Merger Consideration.

      (d) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall deliver to the holders of Company Stock Purchase Right appropriate notices
(the "Company Stock Purchase Right Notices") (i) informing them that each
Company Stock Purchase Right has been cancelled and converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration and (ii) setting forth the schedule as to when
such Company Stock Purchase Right vests. Promptly following the vesting of each
Company Stock Purchase

                                                                              57

Right, Parent shall pay to such holder of the Company Stock Purchase Right the
Merger Consideration. If all conditions for payment have been satisfied, then
payment shall be made no later than the fifteenth (15th) day after the end of
the month in which the Company Stock Purchase Right becomes vested.

      (e) Except as (i) otherwise agreed to in writing or (ii) as otherwise

agreements, all restrictions, cancellations, terminations or limitations on
transfer and vesting with respect to Company Stock Options or Company Stock
Purchase Rights awarded under the Company Stock Plan or any other plan, program
or arrangement of the Company or the Subsidiaries, to the extent that such
restrictions, cancellations, terminations or limitations shall not have already
lapsed, shall remain in full force and effect with respect to such Company Stock
Options and Company Stock Purchase Rights after giving effect to the Merger and
the conversion as set forth above.

      (f) For purposes of this Agreement, "In-The-Money Company Stock Options"
means all Company Stock Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time with an exercise price lower than the Merger Consideration; and (ii)
"Company Optionholders" means the holders of In-The-Money Company Stock Options.

      (g) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be subject to
any required withholding of taxes and shall be paid without interest.

      (h) The Company shall ensure that each provision in each Benefit Plan
providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any shares of Company Common
Stock or any Company Stock Options, Company Stock Purchase Rights or any other
interests in respect of any capital stock (including any "phantom" stock or
stock appreciation rights) of the Company shall be deleted prior to the
Effective Time, and shall ensure, prior to the Effective Time that, following
the Effective Time, there shall be no rights to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock, Company Stock Options, Company Stock Purchase Rights or any other
interests in respect of any capital stock (including any "phantom" stock or
stock appreciation rights) of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or their
Subsidiaries.

      (i) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in
all events prior to the Effective Time, the Company agrees that the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the
Company Stock Plan and the Deferred Compensation Plan) shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions (including obtaining any required
consents) as may be required to effect the terms of this Section 6.04.

      SECTION 6.05. Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance. (a) Parent and
Sub shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and
fulfill in all respects all obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
respect of rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) and any
indemnification or other agreements of the Company as in effect on the date of
this Agreement and disclosed on Section 6.05 of the Company Letter shall be
assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at
the Effective Time, and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms; provided that such obligations
shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable
Law. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (and other
similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement
of expenses and exculpation that are at least as favorable as the
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation provisions contained in
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other comparable organizational
documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, and during
such six-year period, such provisions shall not be repealed, amended or
otherwise modified in any manner except as required by applicable Law.

      (b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to
any person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation then, and in each
such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors
and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.05.

      (c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in
effect the Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance
covering each person currently covered by the Company's directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement;
provided that in no event shall Parent be required to pay, with respect to the
entire six year period following the Effective Time, premiums for insurance
under this Section 6.05(c) that in the aggregate exceed 225% of the current
annual premium paid by the Company (which premium is hereby represented and
warranted by the Company to be set forth in Section 6.05(b) of the Company
Letter), it being understood that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to
provide such coverage, with respect to the entire six year period following the
Effective Time, as may be obtained for such 225% amount; provided further that
Parent may (i) substitute therefor policies of any reputable insurance company
or (ii) satisfy its obligation under this Section 6.05(c) by causing the

<PAGE>
                                                                              59

Surviving Corporation to obtain, at the Effective Time, prepaid (or "tail")
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy, in each case, the material
terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable to such
directors and officers than the insurance coverage otherwise required under this
Section 6.05(c). Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-year
prepaid "tail" policy to its existing directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy (which "tail" policy shall contain the same terms and
conditions as such existing policy), and in such event, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and
continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of
this Section 6.05(c) for such six-year period; provided that in no event shall
the Company pay a premium for such "tail" policy that in the aggregate exceeds
225% of the current annual premium paid by the Company (it being understood that
the Company may nevertheless acquire a "tail" policy providing such coverage as
may be obtained for such 225% amount).

      (d) The obligations set forth in this Section 6.05 shall not be
terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects
any indemnified party under this Section 6.05 (or his or her heirs and his or
her representatives) without the prior written consent of such affected
indemnified party (or his or her heirs and his or her representatives). The
provisions of this Section 6.05 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her
representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by
contract or otherwise.

      SECTION 6.06. Fees and Expenses. (a) Except as expressly set forth in this
Section 6.06, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the
Offer or the Merger is consummated.

      (b) In the event that (i) a 50% Proposal is publicly announced or
otherwise becomes publicly known to the Company's stockholders or an intention
(whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to make a 50% Proposal
is publicly announced or otherwise becomes publicly known to the Company's
stockholders and thereafter (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or
the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) and (B) prior to the date that is 12
months after such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters
into any Acquisition Agreement with respect to any 40% Proposal, the Board of
Directors of the Company recommends acceptance of any 40% Proposal or any 40%
Proposal is consummated, (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.01(c) or 8.01(d) or (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 8.01(e), then, in each such case, the Company shall pay
Parent a cash fee equal to $38,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer
of same-day funds to an account designated by Parent (A) in the case of a
<PAGE>
                                                                              60

termination by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c) or 8.01(d), within two
business days after such termination, (B) in the case of a payment as a result
of any event referred to in Section 6.06(b)(i)(B), no later than the first to
occur of such events and (C) in the case of a termination by the Company
pursuant to Section 8.01(e), prior to or concurrently with such termination.

      For purposes of this Agreement, the term "50% Proposal" shall have the
meaning set forth in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal," except that all
references therein to "15% or more" shall be deemed references to "50% or more."
For purposes of this Agreement, the term "40% Proposal" shall have the meaning
set forth in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal," except that all
references therein to "15% or more" shall be deemed references to "40% or more."

      (c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
6.06 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement and that any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 6.06 do not
constitute a penalty. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the
amounts due pursuant to this Section 6.06 and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
amounts set forth in this Section 6.06, the Company shall pay to Parent its
reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit and any appeal relating thereto, together with
interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 6.06 at the prime rate of
Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

      SECTION 6.07. Public Announcements. The parties agree that the initial
press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be in a form agreed to by the parties. Parent and Sub, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, further agree that they shall
consult with the other with respect to any other press releases, public
statements and other public communications relating to this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or
national securities quotation system, in which case, Parent and Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other to the
extent reasonably practicable before making any such press release or other
public statements or other public communications with respect to this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided however that the parties shall not be required to consult with the
other with respect to any press release or other public statements or other
public communications after the Board of Directors of the Company effects an
Adverse Recommendation Change (or pursuant to which the Board of Directors of
the Company discloses or announces an Adverse Recommendation Change).

      SECTION 6.08. Sub Compliance. Parent shall cause Sub to fulfill all of
Sub's obligations under this Agreement, and in the event that Sub shall fail to
fulfill any of its obligations hereunder, Parent shall fulfill such obligations.

      SECTION 6.09. Directors. Following the Offer Closing, Parent or Sub shall
be entitled to designate, from time to time, such number of members of the Board
of Directors of the Company as will give Sub, subject to compliance with Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act, representation equal to at least that number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, that is the product of (a) the
total number of directors (giving effect to the directors elected or appointed
pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (b) the percentage that (i) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Sub or any other Subsidiary
of Parent (including shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment and
paid for pursuant to the Offer) bears to (ii) the number of shares of the
Company Common Stock then outstanding; provided, however, that, in the event
that Parent's designees are appointed or elected to the Board of Directors of
the Company, until the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company
shall have at least two (2) directors who are directors on the date hereof who
are Independent Directors; provided further, that if there is in office only one
Independent Director, the Board of Directors of the Company will take all
reasonable action necessary to cause a person designated by the remaining
Independent Director to fill such vacancy who shall be an Independent Director
or, if no Independent Directors remain, the other directors shall designate two
persons to fill the vacancies who shall be Independent Directors. The Company
shall take all action requested by Parent necessary to effect any such election
or appointment, including (A) increasing the size of the Board of Directors of
the Company and (B) obtaining the resignation of such number of its current
directors as is, in each case, necessary to enable such designees to be so
elected or appointment to the Board of Directors of the Company in compliance
with applicable Law (including, to the extent applicable prior to the Effective
Time, Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and Rule 4350(d)(2) of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.). The Company shall take all action
necessary to cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of
members, rounded up to the next whole number, on (i) each committee of the Board
of Directors of the Company and (ii) each board of directors of each Subsidiary
of the Company (and each committee thereof) that represents the same percentage
as such individuals represent on the Board of Directors of the Company, in each
case to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. The Company's
obligations to appoint Parent's designees to the Board of Directors of the
Company and committees of such Board of Directors shall be subject to Section
14(f) of the 1934 Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall
promptly take all actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such
information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors, as
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order to fulfill its obligations under
this Section. Parent shall supply to the Company in writing any information with
respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required
by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

                                                                              62

      SECTION 6.10. Convertible Notes. From and after the Offer Closing, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to take all actions reasonably
necessary to comply with the terms of the Indenture with respect to the Company
Convertible Notes and the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of March 28,
2007, by and among the Company and certain initial purchasers of the Company
Convertible Notes.

      SECTION 6.11. Parent and Sub Financing. (a) Parent and Sub shall use their
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Commitment Letter, including by using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
effect the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions reflected
in the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Parent and Sub in such definitive agreements that are within their
control, (iv) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter, and (v)
consummate the Financing at or prior to Offer Closing; provided that
notwithstanding, and as an alternative to, the foregoing, Parent and Sub may in
any case obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms that are
not less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent and Sub then the Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter ("New Debt Financing Commitments") ;
provided further that any such New Debt Financing Commitments shall not (A)
expand or adversely change in any material respect the conditions to the
Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or (B) reasonably be expected
to adversely impact the ability of Parent and Sub to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement. Upon and from and after such event, the term
"Financing" as used herein shall be deemed to mean the Financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent in effect at the time in question and
the New Debt Financing Commitments to the extent then in effect. In the event
any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter for any reason, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event Parent and Sub shall use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing from alternative
sources ("Alternative Financing") on terms that are not less favorable, in the
aggregate, to Parent and Sub then the Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably apprised as to the status of,
and any material developments relating to, the Financing.

      (b) Prior to the Closing, the Company agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to provide Parent and Sub with all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the arrangement of the Financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter or any Alternative Financing, including, without
limitation, (A) using reasonable best efforts to assist in the preparation of
confidential information memoranda and rating agency presentations with respect
to the Financing or any Alternative Financing, (B) delivering such financial and
statistical information and projections relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested in

<PAGE>

                                                                              63

connection with the Financing or any Alternative Financing, (C) using its
reasonable best efforts to arrange for the Company's independent accountants to
provide such assistance to Parent that may be reasonably required in respect of
the Financing or any Alternative Financing (including the preparation of
financial statements, pro forma financial statements and comfort letters, in
each case in compliance with requirements for financings of this sort and
otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the lenders), (D) making appropriate
officers of the Company available for due diligence meetings and for
participation in meetings with rating agencies and prospective lenders, (E)
providing timely access to diligence materials and appropriate personnel to
allow lenders and their representatives to complete all appropriate diligence,
and (F) providing assistance with respect to the review and granting of security
interests in collateral for the Financing or any Alternative Financing, and
obtaining any consents associated therewith; provided, however, that the Company
shall not be required to become party to any document related to the Financing
or any Alternative Financing, or have any obligation with respect thereto, prior
to the Effective Time; provided further that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment fee or similar fee with
respect to the Financing or any Alternative Financing prior to the Effective
Time.

      SECTION 6.12. Employee Benefits. Following the Effective Time, Parent
shall arrange for each Company Benefit Plan participant who becomes a Parent
employee (or an employee of any Parent subsidiary or affiliate) after the
Effective Time (the "Transferred Employees") to be eligible for at least
substantially the same benefits in the aggregate as those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent. Each Transferred Employee (including without
limitation all eligible dependents) shall, to the extent permitted by law and
applicable tax qualification requirements, receive credit including for
eligibility to participate and vesting under Parent employee benefit plans for
years of service with the Company (and its subsidiaries, affiliates, and
predecessors) prior to the Effective Time (except where doing so would cause a
duplication of benefits). If applicable, Parent shall cause any and all
pre-existing condition (or actively at work or similar) limitations, eligibility
waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any group health
plans to be waived with respect to such Transferred Employees and their eligible
dependents in accordance with applicable laws and shall provide them with credit
for any co-payments, deductibles, and offsets (or similar payments) made during
the plan year including the Effective Time for the purposes of satisfying any
applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar requirements under any Parent
employee benefit plans or programs in which they are eligible to participate
after the Effective Time. Nothing contained in this Agreement (including,
without limitation, this Section 6.12) shall (i) amend, or be deemed to amend,
any Company Benefit Plan, (ii) provide any person not a party to this Agreement
with any right, benefit or remedy with regard to any Company Benefit Plan or a
right to enforce any provision of this Agreement, or (iii) limit in any way the
Surviving Corporation's ability to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan
at any time.

      SECTION 6.13. Company 401(k) Plan. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall take all necessary steps to terminate the Company's Incorporated Savings
and Deferred Profit Sharing Plan (the "401(k) Plan") and cease all future
contributions to the 401(k) Plan, effective as of a date prior to the Closing
Date (other than the repayment by 401(k) Plan participants of any outstanding
loan).

      SECTION 6.14. FIRPTA Certificate. On or prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a properly executed statement in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent for purposes of satisfying Parent's obligations
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3).

            (b) by either Parent or the Company:

            (i) at any time prior to the Offer Closing, if the Offer shall have

      failure of the Offer Closing to occur prior to such date and such action
      or failure to act constitutes a material breach of this Agreement; or

            (ii) if any Legal Restraint having the effect of preventing the
      consummation of the Offer or the Merger shall have become final and
      nonappealable; or

the Company by the Termination Date, the Company does not commence efforts to
cure such breach or failure within 10 business days after its receipt of written

and warranties of Parent and Sub contained in this Agreement that are not so
qualified are not true and correct in all material respects, in each case as of
the date of this Agreement and as of the Offer Closing Time, except that the
accuracy of representations and warranties that by their terms speak as of a
specified date will be determined as of such date, or (ii) Parent or Sub shall
have failed to perform in all material respects any of its covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement required to be performed by them under
this Agreement at or prior to the Offer Closing, in each case, which breach or
failure to perform is incapable of being cured by Parent or Sub by the
Termination Date or, if capable of being cured by Parent by the Termination
Date, Parent and Sub do not commence efforts to cure such breach or failure
within 10 business days after their receipt of written notice thereof from the
Company and reasonably pursue such cure thereafter.

      SECTION 8.02. Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.01, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability
or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company, other than the
provisions of the penultimate sentence of Section 6.02(a), Section 6.06, this
Section 8.02 and Article IX and except for any intentional breach by a party of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement, liability for which shall not be affected by termination of this
Agreement or any payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 6.06(b)).

      SECTION 8.03. Amendment. Subject to Section 8.05, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto at any time, whether before or after the Offer
Closing shall have occurred or the Stockholder Approval, if required by
applicable Law, has been obtained; provided, however, that (a) after the Offer
Closing, there shall be no amendment that decreases the Merger Consideration and
(b) after the Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no
amendment that by Law requires further approval by stockholders of the Company
without the further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

      SECTION 8.04. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement (including Section 1.01)
and in Section 8.05, the parties may, (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein; provided, however, that after the
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no waiver that by
Law requires further approval by stockholders of the Company without the further
approval of such stockholders. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument

<PAGE>

                                                                              67

in writing signed on behalf of such party which specifically sets forth the
terms of such extension or waiver. The failure or delay by any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall any single or partial exercise
by any party to this Agreement of any of its rights under this Agreement
preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other rights under
this Agreement.

      SECTION 8.05. Approval of Independent Directors. Following the election or
appointment of Parent's or Sub's designees pursuant to Section 6.09 and prior to
the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of a majority of the Independent
Directors then in office shall be required for the Company to consent (a) to
amend or terminate this Agreement, (b) to waive any of the Company's rights or
remedies under this Agreement, (c) to extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Sub, or (d) to take any other
action of the Company's Board of Directors under or in connection with this
Agreement if such action would materially and adversely affect the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent or Sub).

construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of

consent of the other parties, except that Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Sub of any of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns.

      SECTION 9.09. Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Venue. Each of
the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive

Delaware) for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out
of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby (and agrees that no

of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such
person's respective address set forth above shall be effective service of
process for any action, suit or proceeding in the State of Delaware with respect

induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual waiver
and certifications in this Section 9.10.

occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It
is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery
(and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, in any Delaware
State court or the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the
State of Delaware), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity.

      SECTION 9.12. Consents and Approvals. For any matter under this Agreement
requiring the consent or approval of any party to be valid and binding on the
parties hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing and executed and
delivered to the other parties by a person duly authorized by such party to do
so.

      SECTION 9.13. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held
