NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree as follows:

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

1  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

ARTICLE I

  

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

  


 

  

Section 1.1 The Offer.

  


 

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as promptly as
reasonable practicable (but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days)
after the date of execution of this Agreement by all parties hereto, Merger
Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence, within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, the Offer. The obligations
of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment,
and pay for, any shares of Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are
subject to the conditions set forth in Annex I (the "Offer Conditions"). The
Offer shall initially expire at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the date
that is twenty (20) Business Days following the commencement of the Offer
(determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act). Merger
Sub expressly reserves the right to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer
Condition or modify the terms of the Offer; provided, however, that, without
the consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit
Merger Sub to, (i) reduce the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the
Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) amend, modify or waive the Minimum
Tender Condition, (iv) except as expressly provided in this Section 1.1(a),
extend or otherwise amend or modify the expiration date of the Offer, (v)
change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (vi) otherwise amend,
modify or supplement any of the terms of the Offer in any manner adverse to
any holder of Common Stock or (vii) provide any "subsequent offering period"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, but
subject to the parties' rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1 and Merger Sub's right to waive any Offer Condition other than the Minimum
Tender Condition, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, (i)
extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to
five (5) Business Days (or such longer period as the parties hereto may agree)
each, if, at any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer, any Offer Condition
(other than the Minimum Tender Condition) shall not have been satisfied or
waived, until such time as each such condition shall have been satisfied or
waived, and (ii) extend the Offer for the minimum period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof
applicable to the Offer; provided, however, that in no event shall Merger Sub
be required to extend the Offer beyond the Termination Date. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to the
parties' rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, if, at
any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer, each Offer Condition (other than
the Minimum Tender Condition) shall have been satisfied or waived and the
Minimum Tender Condition shall not have been satisfied, then Merger Sub may
and, if requested by the Company, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, extend the Offer by increments of seven (7) Business Days (or
such other period as the parties hereto may agree); provided, however, that
Merger Sub shall only be required to extend the Offer under this sentence on
two occasions and; provided, further, that Merger Sub shall not be required to
extend the Offer beyond the Termination Date. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, all shares of
Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the
Offer promptly after the applicable expiration date of the Offer (as it may be
extended and re-extended in accordance with this Section 1.1(a)). Acceptance
for payment of shares of Common Stock by Merger Sub pursuant to and subject to
the conditions of the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer
Closing." The Offer may not be terminated prior to its expiration date (as
such expiration date may be extended and re-extended in accordance with this
Section 1.1(a)), unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance
with Section 7.1. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1,
then, in each case, Merger Sub shall promptly (and, in any event, within
twenty-four (24) hours of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer and Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any
depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered shares of
Common Stock to the registered holders thereof.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file
with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer
(together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Schedule
TO"), which shall include, as exhibits, an offer to purchase and a related
letter of transmittal, a summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer
documents pursuant to which the Offer will be made (such Schedule TO and the
documents attached as exhibits thereto, together with any amendments or
supplements thereto, the "Offer Documents"). The Company shall promptly
furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all information requested by Parent and
Merger Sub concerning the Company that is required by the Exchange Act to be
set forth in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall
take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to
cause the Offer Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the
SEC and disseminated to the Company's stockholders, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. Parent and Merger Sub
shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the
SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Offer
Documents, and shall provide the Company with copies of all correspondence
between Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents.
Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, Parent and Merger
Sub shall provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and to
propose comments on such document or response.

  


 

  

(c) Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Common Stock that Merger
Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

  


 

  

Section 1.2 Company Actions.

  


 

  

(a) On the date the initial Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the
Company shall, in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, file with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/ Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all
amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9"), which
shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5.4, describe and make the Company
Recommendation with respect to the Offer, shall reflect that the Merger is
governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall be consummated as soon as
practicable following the completion of the Offer and include a copy (and
summary description) of the opinion referred to in Section 3.19, and shall
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated or
made available to the holders of Common Stock. The Company and Parent shall
cooperate to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed or otherwise disseminated
together with the Offer Documents to the holders of Common Stock. Parent and
Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning
Parent and Merger Sub that is required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in
the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9, if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend
or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so
amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
holders of Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities Laws. The Company shall promptly notify Parent
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall provide Parent with
copies of all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9. Prior to the
filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the
dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments such document or
response. Unless a Change of Recommendation has been made in accordance with
Section 5.4, the Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer
Documents of the recommendation of the Company Board contained in the Schedule
14D-9.

(b) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall cause its
transfer agent to promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days
after the date of execution of this Agreement by all parties hereto) furnish
Parent and Merger Sub with mailing labels containing the names and addresses
of the record holders of Common Stock as of the most recent practicable date
of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together
with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position listings, computer
files and all other information in the Company's possession or control
regarding the beneficial owners of Common Stock, and shall furnish to Merger
Sub such information (including updated lists of stockholders, security
position listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in
connection with communicating the Offer to the Company's stockholders. Parent
and Merger Sub shall keep confidential and not disclose the information
contained in any such labels, lists, listings and files, in each case as
required by the Confidentiality Agreement, shall use such information only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to the Company or destroy all copies
of such information then in their possession or control in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement. In addition, in connection with the Offer, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub to disseminate the Offer
Documents to holders of shares of Common Stock held in, or subject to, any
Company Benefit Plan and, to the extent provided for in any such Company
Benefit Plan, to permit such holders of shares to tender shares of Common
Stock in the Offer.

  


 

  

Section 1.3 Directors. Upon the Offer Closing and all times thereafter,
subject to compliance with applicable Laws and the applicable rules of NASDAQ,
Merger Sub shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of directors,
rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board as is equal to the
product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company Board (after
giving effect to the directors elected or designated by Merger Sub pursuant to
this sentence) multiplied by (ii) the percentage that the aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent, Merger Sub and any of
their Subsidiaries bears to the total number of shares of Common Stock then
outstanding. As used in this Agreement, the term "beneficial ownership" (and
its correlative terms) shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act. The Company and the Company Board shall, upon
Merger Sub's request at any time following the Offer Closing, take all such
actions necessary to (A) appoint to the Company Board the individuals
designated by Merger Sub and permitted to be so designated by the first
sentence of this Section 1.3, including promptly filling vacancies or newly
created directorships on the Company Board, promptly increasing the size of
the Company Board (including by amending the bylaws of the Company if
necessary so as to increase the size of the Company Board) and/or promptly
securing the resignations of such number of its incumbent directors as are
necessary or desirable to enable Merger Sub's designees to be so elected or
designated to the Company Board, and (B) cause Merger Sub's designees to be so
appointed at such time. The Company shall, upon Merger Sub's request following
the Offer Closing, also cause Persons elected or designated by Merger Sub to
constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on
the Company Board of each committee of the Company Board to the extent
permitted by applicable Laws and the rules of NASDAQ. From and after the Offer
Closing, the Company shall, at Parent's request, take all action necessary to

Company shall promptly upon execution of this Agreement take all actions
required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l in order
to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3, including mailing to
stockholders (together with the Schedule 14D-9) the information required by

provisions of the DGCL.

 

  

  

Section 1.8 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving

bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to be in the
form of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that (a) all references therein to Merger
Sub shall be automatically amended and shall become references to the
Surviving Corporation, (b) the provisions of the certificate of incorporation
of Merger Sub relating to the incorporator of Merger Sub shall be omitted and
(c) changes necessary so that they shall be in compliance with Section 5.10

ARTICLE II

  

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  


 

  

Section 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

  


 

  

(a) Conversion of Common Stock. Except as otherwise provided in Section
2.1(b), each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the
right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration"). Each share of Common Stock to be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1(a) shall be
automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of stock
certificates representing Common Stock (the "Certificates") or book-entry
shares ("Book-Entry Shares") which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.2, the Merger
Consideration.

  


 

  

(b) Treasury Shares; Parent and Merger Sub Owned Shares. Each share of Common
Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or held by Parent or Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in
exchange therefor or in respect thereof.

  


 

  

(c) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(d) Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock
shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Common Stock) with a record date
during such period, the Offer Price and Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such change and such adjustment shall provide
the Company's stockholders the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such action

  


 

  

(e) Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(a), to the extent that
holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL, shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised and perfected
his or her demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if any such holder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his or her right
to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, or a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL, such holder's shares of Common Stock shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and such
shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The aggregate Merger
Consideration shall be reduced, on a dollar for dollar basis, as if the holder
of such Dissenting Shares had not been a stockholder on the Merger Closing
Date. Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration made available to the
Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.2 to pay for Dissenting Shares will be
returned to Parent upon demand. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
notice of any written demands for appraisal or payment of the fair value of
any shares of Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to stockholders' rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL and the Company shall not voluntarily, without the prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment with respect to, settle or offer to settle, any
such demands.

  


 

  

Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.

  


 

  

(a) Exchange Fund. Prior to or at the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall be
appointed by Parent (and reasonably satisfactory to the Company) to act as a
paying agent hereunder (the "Paying Agent"), in trust for the benefit of
holders of the Common Stock, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than the Dissenting Shares), payable upon due surrender of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article II (such cash in
the aggregate being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). In the
event any Dissenting Shares cease to be Dissenting Shares, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent in the Exchange Fund,
an amount equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration multiplied by
(ii) the number of such formerly Dissenting Shares. In the event the Exchange
Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly deposit additional funds with the Paying Agent in an
amount sufficient to make such payments. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The
Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as reasonably directed by
Parent; provided, however, that (i) any investment of such cash shall in all
events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term
obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in
deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available), or a combination of the foregoing, and (ii) no such
investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the former
holders of shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Article II.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Payment Procedures.

  


 

  

(i) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for
collection by hand) to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding
shares of Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss together with any required bond or
indemnity in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and which
shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company
may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration into which the number of shares of Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement. Parent shall require the paying agent agreement to
provide that the Paying Agent deliver such letter of transmittal and
instructions not later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time.
Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss together with
any required bond or indemnity in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, including
by the entry through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of any
Shares held in book entry on a book-entry statement, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily and
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares shall
be entitled to receive from the Exchange Fund in exchange therefor an amount
in cash equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock
represented by such holder's properly surrendered Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares and (B) the Merger
Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes). No interest will be
paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment upon due surrender
of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate
formerly representing such shares of Common Stock is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer and other
applicable Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. The Merger
Consideration, paid in full (less any applicable withholding Taxes) with
respect to any share of Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof,
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Common Stock.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) The Paying Agent, the Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent and Merger
Sub, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), and
the regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts (A)
shall be remitted by the applicable entity to the appropriate Governmental
Entity and (B) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made. The parties hereto agree to cooperate in good faith in requesting and
providing any information or documentation allowing for the reduction or
elimination of any such deduction and withholding.

  


 

  

(c) Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, the
holder of any such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be given a copy of
the letter of transmittal referred to in Section 2.2(b) and instructed to
comply with the instructions in that letter of transmittal in order to receive
the cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article II.

  


 

  

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the
former holders of shares of Common Stock on the first (1st) anniversary of the
Closing Date shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon its demand,
and any former holders of shares of Common Stock who have not surrendered
their Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in
accordance with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration upon due
surrender of their Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof), in each case subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  


 

  

(e) No Liability. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or
any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Common
Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  


 

  

(f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the case of any Certificate
that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable and customary amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the number of shares of Common
Stock formerly represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
multiplied by the Merger Consideration (without interest and less any
applicable withholding Taxes).

Section 2.3 Treatment of Company Options and Company Restricted Stock; ESPP.

  


 

  

(a) Effective as of the Offer Closing, each Company Option that is outstanding
and unvested immediately prior to the Offer Closing shall become fully vested
and exercisable. As of the Effective Time, each Company Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled without any action on the part of any holder of any Company Option in
consideration for the right at the Effective Time to receive, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time (and in all events, to the
extent that the Company has provided reasonably required payment and
withholding information to Parent, no later than the later of (i) seven (7)
Business Days thereafter and (ii) the end of the first payroll period ending
after the Effective Time), a cash payment (less required withholding Taxes and
deductions) with respect thereto equal to the product of (A) the number of
shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to such Company
Option (the "Option Cash Payment," and the sum of all such payments, the
"Total Option Cash Payments"). As of the Effective Time, all Company Options
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically terminate and cease to
exist, and each holder of a Company Option shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Option Cash Payment (if any)
in respect thereof.

  


 

  

(b) Effective as of the Offer Closing, each share of Company Restricted Stock
shall become fully vested, and the restrictions thereon shall lapse. All such
vested shares of Company Restricted Stock shall be treated identically to all
other shares of Common Stock with respect to the payment of Merger
Consideration.

  


 

  

(c) The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that (i) no
offering period under the ESPP shall be commenced on or after the date of this
Agreement, (ii) no new participants may join the offering period in existence
under the ESPP on or after the date of this Agreement and (iii) no participant
may increase the amount of his or her salary deferrals with respect to such
offering period. In the event that the offering period under the ESPP in
effect as of the date of this Agreement has not ended on the date immediately
preceding the Effective Time, then the ESPP and such offering period shall be
terminated as of the day immediately preceding the Effective Time, and all
participant contributions then in the ESPP shall be used to purchase shares of
Common Stock on such date in accordance with the terms of the ESPP as if such
date was the last day of such offering period. As of the Effective Time, all
shares of Common Stock purchased under the ESPP shall be treated identically
to all other shares of Common Stock with respect to the payment of the Merger
Consideration as set forth in Section 2.1(a), and the Company shall cause the
ESPP to terminate.

  


 

  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) provide optionees with
notice of their opportunity to exercise their Company Options if such notice
is required by the applicable plan or award agreement, (ii) provide
participants in the current offering period under the ESPP with notice of
their opportunity to terminate their outstanding purchase rights prior to the
Effective Time as may be required by the ESPP and (iii) adopt such resolutions
and take all other such actions as may reasonably be necessary in its
discretion to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3. The
Company shall ensure, prior to the Effective Time, that following the
Effective Time, no current or former participant in any Company Stock Plan or
Company Benefit Plan shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital
stock of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries or any
other equity interest therein (including any phantom stock, stock appreciation
rights or performance units).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(e) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be paid without
interest. When any payment pursuant to Section 2.3(a) (in respect of Company
Options) or pursuant to Section 2.3(b) (in respect of Company Restricted
Stock), in each case to employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries, becomes
payable, any such payment shall first be made to the regular payroll account
of the Company, and the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
shall pay to the applicable recipient of such payment such amount less any
Taxes required to be withheld in full payment thereon.

prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter").
Each disclosure set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter or such Company SEC
Documents shall qualify or modify each of the representations and warranties
set forth in this Article III to the extent the applicability of the
disclosure to such representation and warranty is reasonably apparent from the
text of the disclosure made and, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Letter as an
exception to a representation or warranty will not be deemed an admission that

legal concept) as a foreign corporation or other relevant legal entity in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company's Subsidiaries is a legal
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (where applicable
as a legal concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and
has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and

its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

(b) Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of each Subsidiary of the Company as of the date hereof, each
such Subsidiary's jurisdiction of incorporation, organization or formation and

shares of Common Stock that could be acquired with accumulated payroll
deductions under the ESPP at the close of business on February 27, 2015
(assuming (A) the market price of a share of Common Stock as of the close of
business on such date is equal to the Merger Consideration, (B) such date
represents the last day of the current offering period and (C) payroll
deductions continue at the current rate) will not exceed 1,000 shares. All
outstanding shares of Common Stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable, and are not subject to and were not issued in
violation of any preemptive or similar right, purchase option, call or right
of first refusal or similar right. Upon the issuance of any shares of Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Plans, such shares of
Common Stock will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. No Subsidiary of the Company owns any shares of capital stock
of the Company.

  


 

  

(b) Except as set forth in subsection (a) above, the Company does not have any
shares of its capital stock or other voting securities issued or outstanding,
other than shares of Common Stock that have become outstanding pursuant to the

after January 8, 2015, which were reserved for issuance as of such date as set
forth in subsection (a) above.

  


 

  

(c) Except as set forth in subsection (a) above, there are no outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights, profits interests, stock
appreciation rights, phantom stock, convertible securities or other similar
rights, agreements, arrangements, undertakings or commitments of any kind to
which the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries is a party or by which
any of them is bound obligating the Company or any of the Company's
Subsidiaries to (i) issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock or
other equity interests of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity
interests, (ii) grant, extend or enter into any such subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, rights, profits interests, stock appreciation rights, phantom
stock, convertible securities or other similar rights, agreements,

12  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes or other obligations, the holders of which have the right to
vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable for securities having the
right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company on any matter.

  


 

  

(e) There are no voting agreements, voting trusts, stockholders agreements,
proxies or other agreements or understandings to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of the capital stock or
other equity interest of, restricting the transfer of, or providing for
registration rights with respect to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(f) With respect to the Company Options and Company Restricted Stock
(collectively, the "Company Equity Awards"), each Company Equity Award was
granted in material compliance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock
Plan, the Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws and regulatory rules or
requirements, including the rules of NASDAQ and any other exchange on which
Company securities are traded. The Company has not knowingly granted, and
there is no and has been no policy or practice of the Company of granting,
Company Options prior to, or otherwise coordinating the grant of Company
Options with, the release or other public announcement of material information
regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries or their results of operations or
prospects. Each Company Equity Award may, by its terms, be treated in
accordance with Section 2.3. Section 3.2(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth, with respect to each Company Equity Award, (A) the name of each

Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations
of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the Company SEC Documents,

meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder. Neither the Company nor any of

Section 5.3 Access; Confidentiality.

  


 

  

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, the Company shall afford to

notice, reasonable access during normal business hours, during the period
prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the date, if any, on which this
Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, to the Company's and
its Subsidiaries' officers, employees, properties, Contracts, commitments,
books and records, other than, subject to Section 5.4, any such matters that
relate to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement, or to any
Acquisition Proposals (such matters being governed by Section 5.4). The
foregoing notwithstanding, the Company shall not be required to afford such
access if it would (i) unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) cause a risk of a loss of privilege to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (provided that the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to develop an alternative to providing such
information reasonably acceptable to Parent), (iii) include any environmental
sampling or testing of the Company's owned or leased real property or (iv)
reasonably be expected to result in a violation of any applicable Law.

  


 

  

(b) Parent hereby agrees that all information provided to it, Merger Sub or

Confidential Information, as such term is used in, and shall be treated in
accordance with the confidentiality agreement, dated as of August 5, 2014,
between the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

  


 

  

Section 5.4 Acquisition Proposals.

  


 

  

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors
and employees shall, and the Company shall cause its other Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any
potential Acquisition Proposal and shall promptly request the return from, or
destruction by, all such Persons of all non-public information previously
furnished or made available to such Persons by or on behalf of the Company in
accordance with the terms of any confidentiality or similar agreement in place
with such Person. Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.4, until the
Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Article VII, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
officers, directors and employees shall not, and the Company shall not
authorize or knowingly permit its other Representatives to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate any
inquiry or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or take any
action that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to, or provide any
non-public information or data concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries to
any Person relating to, an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement, or
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or agreement in principle,
or any other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement containing
terms as to confidentiality that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (any such
confidentiality agreement, an "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement"))
relating to an Acquisition Proposal (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement").
Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions on the Company set forth in this Section 5.4 by any
Representative of the Company shall be deemed a breach of this Section 5.4 by
the Company.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a), at any time prior to the Offer Closing, if
the Company receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from any Person
after the date of this Agreement which did not result from a breach of this
Section 5.4, (i) the Company and its Representatives may provide information
(including any non-public information) regarding, and afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books, records and personnel of, the Company and
its Subsidiaries to such Person pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement; provided that the Company shall make available to Parent and Merger
Sub any non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that
was not previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub prior to, or
concurrently with, providing such information to any such Person and (ii) the
Company and its Representatives may engage in, enter into or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person with respect
to such Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that prior to taking
any action described in clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal and the Company provides Parent written notice of such determination.
The Company shall promptly provide notice to Parent in writing (and in any
case within forty-eight (48) hours of knowledge of receipt) of the receipt of
such Acquisition Proposal, or any request for information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for access to the business, properties,
assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any
Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall, in any such
notice to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal or request, and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a
reasonably current basis of all material developments affecting the status and
terms of such Acquisition Proposal or request or any changes to the material
terms thereof (and the Company shall promptly provide Parent with copies of
any material written materials relating to such Acquisition Proposal or
request (including any indications of interest, letters of intent or draft
agreements) or any changes to the material terms thereof) and of the status of
any such discussions or negotiations.

  


 

  

(c) Except as set forth in this Section 5.4(c), the Company Board shall not
(i) change, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or
resolve to change, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse
to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (ii) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9, (iii) approve, recommend or publicly
propose to approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) if a tender
offer or exchange offer for shares of capital stock of the Company that
constitutes an Acquisition Proposal is commenced, fail to recommend against
acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the Company stockholders
(including, for these purposes, by disclosing that it is taking no position
with respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its
stockholders, which shall constitute a failure to recommend against acceptance
of such tender offer or exchange offer, provided that a customary "stop, look
and listen" communication by the Board of Directors pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
of the Exchange Act shall not be prohibited), within ten (10) Business Days
after commencement (any of the foregoing, a "Change of Recommendation"), or
authorize, adopt, approve or propose to authorize, adopt, approve, or
otherwise cause or permit the Company to enter into, any Alternative
Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, the Company Board may, prior to the Offer Closing, (A) effect
a Change of Recommendation if the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that, as a result of a
development or change in circumstances that occurs or arises after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement (other than an Acquisition Proposal)
that was not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board prior to
the execution and delivery of this Agreement (an "Intervening Event") failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties
under applicable Law or (B) if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal
after the date of this Agreement which did not result from a breach of this
Section 5.4 that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes
a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii)
and authorize, adopt, approve, propose to authorize, adopt or approve, and
cause the Company to enter into, the Alternative Acquisition Agreement
associated with such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company
Board may only take the actions described in the foregoing clauses (A) or (B)
if:

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(1) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent of the
Company Board's intention to take such actions at least four (4) Business Days
in advance of taking such action, which notice shall specify, as applicable, a
reasonably detailed description of such Intervening Event or the material
terms of the Acquisition Proposal received by the Company that constitutes a
Superior Proposal, including a copy of the Alternative Acquisition Agreement
and any other relevant proposed transaction agreements with, and the identity
of, the party making the Acquisition Proposal and other material documents
(including any financing commitments with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal);

  


 

  

(2) after providing such notice and prior to taking such actions, the Company
shall have, and shall have caused its Representatives to, negotiate with
Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) during such
four (4) Business Day period to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would permit the Company Board not to take
such actions; and

  


 

  

(3) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to this
Agreement or other arrangements that may be offered in writing by Parent by
5:00 PM Eastern Time on the last Business Day of such four (4) Business Day
period and shall have determined in good faith (x) with respect to the actions
described in clause (A) of this Section 5.4(c), after consultation with
outside counsel, that it would continue to be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law not to effect the Change of
Recommendation and (y) with respect to the actions described in clause (B) of
this Section 5.4(c), after consultation with outside counsel and its financial
advisors, that the Acquisition Proposal received by the Company continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal, in each case, if such changes offered by
Parent were given effect.

  


 

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company, the Company Board or any committee of the Company Board from (i)
complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state
securities Laws with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders), or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the
stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communications to the stockholders of the Company); provided,
however, that all actions taken or agreed to be taken by the Company, the
Company Board or any committee of the Company Board shall comply with the
provisions of 5.4(a) and; provided, further, that this Section 5.4(d) shall
not be deemed to permit the Company, the Company Board or any committee of the
Company Board to effect a Change of Recommendation except as set forth in
Section 5.4(c).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(e) As used in this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any inquiry,
proposal or offer made by any Person relating to, or that is reasonably
expected to lead to, in each case whether in a single transaction or series of
transactions, (i) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or other
transaction that would result in any Person owning, directly or indirectly,
fifteen percent (15%) or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or
other voting securities of the Company, (ii) the direct or indirect
acquisition by any Person of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, including through
the acquisition of equity interests in any Subsidiary of the Company, or (iii)
the direct or indirect acquisition by any Person of fifteen percent (15%) or
more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or other voting securities of
the Company, including any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any Person beneficially owning fifteen percent (15%) or more
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or other voting securities of the
Company, other than the Transactions.

  


 

  

(f) As used in this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal (with the percentages set forth in the definition of such
term changed from 15% to 50%) that the Company Board has determined in its
good faith judgment (after consultation with outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor) is (i) more favorable to the Company's stockholders from a
financial point of view than the Transactions, taking into account all of the
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (including the expected
timing of consummation of the transactions contemplated by such Acquisition
Proposal) and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this
Agreement committed to by Parent to the Company in writing in response to such
Acquisition Proposal under the provisions of Section 5.4(c)), and (ii)
reasonably capable of being completed in accordance with its terms, taking
into account the financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects and terms of
such proposal and the Person making such Acquisition Proposal.

  


 

  

Section 5.5 Employee Matters.

  


 

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all Company Benefit Plans, and
compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately before the Effective Time, provided that nothing herein
shall be construed as prohibiting the amendment or termination of any of the
foregoing in accordance with its terms or if otherwise required by applicable
Law. During the period commencing on the Effective Time and ending on December
31, 2015 (the "Continuation Period"), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to
be provided, to each current (as of the Effective Time) employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company Employees"): (i) base
salary or wages, cash bonus opportunities (other than any retention or other
special or non-recurring bonus or cash awards) and equity-based compensation
opportunities that are at least equal, in the aggregate, to those that were
provided to the Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time;
provided that, the provision of additional cash-based compensation
opportunities in substitution for equity-based compensation opportunities
shall be permitted; provided further, that for purposes of this clause (i),
the Continuation Period shall end on September 30, 2015, and (ii) all other
compensation and benefits (other than any retention or other special or non-
recurring bonus or incentive awards) that, taken as a whole, are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to such compensation and benefits that were
provided to the Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (A)
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to each
Company Employee whose employment terminates involuntarily during the
Continuation Period other than for cause and other than due to death or
disability (in each case, as determined by Parent in its reasonable
discretion) severance benefits no less favorable than the severance benefits
provided for under the Company's severance arrangements applicable to such
Company Employee as in effect on the date of this Agreement, which
arrangements are summarized on Section 5.5(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, and (B) during the Continuation Period, severance benefits offered to
each Company Employee shall be determined without taking into account any
reduction after the Effective Time in compensation paid to such Company
Employee that would result in Parent's noncompliance with this Section 5.5(a);
provided that, if required under the applicable Company Benefit Plan, in no
event shall any Company Employee be entitled to any such severance benefits
unless and until such Company Employee has delivered to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation a fully executed release of claims in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent and such release has become effective and irrevocable in
accordance with its terms.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate, severance, paid time off and level of benefits but excluding the
accrual of benefits under any defined benefit pension plan) under the employee
benefit plans of Parent and its Affiliates providing benefits to any Company
Employees after the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), each Company Employee
shall, to the extent that such Company Employee participates in such New Plan,
be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time,
provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application
would result in a duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to
a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated (such
plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"), but only to the extent such waiting
time or any other participation restrictions or limitations were satisfied or
did not apply to such Company Employee under the corresponding Old Plan, and
(ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical,
vision, disability and/or life benefits to any Company Employee (or his or her
covered dependents), Parent shall, or shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its third-party insurance providers to, cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and limitations and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents, but only to the extent such pre-existing condition
exclusions and limitations and actively-at-work requirements or any other
participation restrictions or limitations were satisfied or did not apply to
such Company Employee (or his or her covered dependents) under the
corresponding Old Plan, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred
by such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Plans ending on the date such Company Employee's
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such New Plan but only to the extent credited
under the corresponding Old Plan.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans, will occur as of the
Effective Time or the Offer Closing, as applicable.

  


 

  

(d) It is expressly acknowledged, understood and agreed that nothing in this
Section 5.5 or otherwise contained in this Agreement is intended to be or does
or shall constitute an amendment to or establishment of any employee benefit
plan, program, policy, agreement or other arrangement or, subject to the
express provisions of Sections 5.5(a)-(c), shall prevent the amendment or
termination of any such plan, program, policy, agreement or other arrangement.
Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee to any Company Employee of
(i) employment or (ii) without limiting the express provisions of Sections
5.5(a)-(c), any specific term or condition of employment. This Section 5.5
shall be binding and inure solely to the benefit of the parties to this
Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.5, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any other Person (including for the avoidance of doubt any
Participant) any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Section 5.5.

  


 

  

Section 5.6 Consents and Approvals.

  


 

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws and regulations or otherwise to consummate and
make effective the Transactions as promptly as practicable, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) obtain all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals, and expirations or
terminations of waiting periods, including the Company Approvals and the
Parent Approvals, from Governmental Entities and make all necessary
registrations and filings with the applicable Governmental Entities, including
in connection with any Regulatory Law (all of the foregoing, collectively, the
"Governmental Consents"), (ii) obtain all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from third parties and (iii) defend any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the Transactions; provided that in no event shall any
party be required to pay any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third
party for any consent or approval required for the consummation of the
Transactions under any Contract.

  


 

  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate with each
other in (i) determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or
Governmental Consents are required to be obtained from, any Governmental
Entities (including in any foreign jurisdiction in which the Company or its
Subsidiaries are operating any business) and (ii) to the extent not made prior
to the date hereof, timely making or causing to be made all such applications
and filings as reasonably determined by Parent and the Company as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the date
hereof with respect to filings or submissions required under the HSR Act).
Each party shall supply as promptly as reasonably practicable such
information, documentation, other material or testimony that may be requested
by any Governmental Entity, including by complying at the earliest reasonably
practicable date with any request under or with respect to the HSR Act, any
other Governmental Consent and any such other applicable Laws for additional
information, documents or other materials received by Parent or the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries from the Federal Trade Commission or the
Department of Justice, or any other Governmental Entity in connection with
such applications or filings or the Merger.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(c) Without limiting any of its other obligations hereunder, the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to resolve such
objections, if any, as the United States Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, state antitrust
enforcement authorities, or competition authorities of any other nation or
other jurisdiction (including multinational or supranational), or any other
Person, may assert under any Law with respect to the transactions contemplated
herein, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that
may be asserted by any Person with respect to the Merger, in each case so as
to enable the Merger and the Transactions to occur as soon as possible (and in
any event no later than the Termination Date).

  


 

  

(d) Neither Parent nor the Merger Sub shall, nor shall they permit their
respective Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire (whether by merger,
consolidation, acquisition of stock or otherwise) of any interest in any
Person or any business, line of business or division thereof, or a material
portion of the assets of any Person, if such acquisition would reasonably be
expected to materially increase the risk of not obtaining any applicable,
clearance, consent, approval or waiver under any Regulatory Law with respect
to the Transactions.

  


 

  

(e) Without limiting the foregoing and subject to applicable legal limitations
and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, each of the Company and
Parent agrees (i) to reasonably cooperate and consult with each other in
connection with the making of all registrations, filings, notifications,
communications, submissions and any other material actions pursuant to this
Section 5.6, (ii) to furnish to the other such necessary information and
assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of any notifications or filings, (iii) to keep each other
reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated therein, including promptly furnishing the other
with copies of notices or other communications received by such party from, or
given by such party to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Transactions, (iv) to permit the other party to review and to
incorporate the other party's reasonable comments in any communication to be
given by it to any Governmental Entity with respect to obtaining the necessary
approvals for the Transactions, and (v) not to participate in any substantive
meeting or discussion in person or by telephone expected to address
substantive matters related to the transactions contemplated herein with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions unless, to the extent
practicable, it gives the other party reasonable notice thereof and the
opportunity to attend. The parties shall take reasonable efforts to share
information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant
to this Section 5.6 in a manner so as to preserve any applicable privilege.
Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under
this Section 5.6(d) as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and
the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company,
as the case may be) or its legal counsel.

  


 

  

(f) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.6, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a Governmental Entity or any other
Person is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any of the
Transactions as violative of any Law, each of the Company and Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
Transactions, including, without limiting the foregoing, taking the actions
set forth in Section 5.6(c).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, "Regulatory Law" means the Sherman Act,
the Clayton Act, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the EC Merger
Regulation, and all other federal, state, foreign, multinational or
supranational statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative
and judicial doctrines and other Laws, including any antitrust, competition or
trade regulation Laws, that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade or lessening competition through merger or acquisition.

  


 

  

Section 5.7 Takeover Statute. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Transactions after the date of this Agreement, Parent and
the Company shall each use its respective reasonable best efforts to grant
such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize, to
the extent possible, the effects of such statute or regulation on the
Transactions.

  


 

  

Section 5.8 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt
notice to the Company, of (a) any notice or other communication received by
such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement or
the Transactions, or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, (b) any actions,
suits, claims, inquiries, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such
party's knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party which relate to the Transactions or this Agreement and
(c) any breach or failure to perform in any material respect any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of the
other party to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 or the failure
of any condition set forth in Article VI or Annex I of this Agreement to be
satisfied.

  


 

  

Section 5.9 Public Announcements. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
consult with and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon
any press release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance
of such press release or other public statement or comment relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any such
press release or other public statement or comment prior to such consultation
except as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or as may be requested
by a Governmental Entity; provided that the restrictions in this Section 5.9
shall not apply to any communication regarding an Acquisition Proposal or a
Change of Recommendation. Parent and the Company agree to issue a joint press
release announcing this Agreement. The Company shall provide Parent (via a
representative of Parent designated by Parent to the Company in writing) the
opportunity to review and comment (with such comments being provided as
promptly as practicable) upon any communication to be broadly disseminated to
the Company's employees or department or division thereof, or any other
communication to the Company's employees that would be required to be filed as
an exhibit to the Schedule 14D-9, in each case relating to this Agreement or
the Transactions, and shall not make any such communication prior to such
consultation except as may be required by applicable Law.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  


    

Section 5.10 Indemnification and Insurance.

 

  


 

  

(a) The Surviving Corporation, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor
of the current or former directors or officers (collectively, the "Indemnified
Parties"), as the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided
in their respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other
organizational documents or in any agreement with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries set forth in Section 5.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. The
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Company's and
any Company Subsidiary's certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with
any of their respective directors or officers as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time and set forth in Section 5.10(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors or
officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting Section 5.10(a) or any rights of any Indemnified Party
pursuant to any indemnification arrangement, from and after the acceptance for
payment of, and payment by Merger Sub for, any shares of Common Stock pursuant
to the Offer, in the event of any threatened or actual Proceeding, whether
civil, criminal or administrative, based in whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless,
as and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each such
Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any Proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law upon receipt of any undertaking required by
applicable Law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in
connection with any such threatened or actual Proceeding. None of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in any threatened or actual Proceeding for which indemnification
could be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such Proceeding or such Indemnified
Party otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent.
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with an Indemnified Party
in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified Party could seek
indemnification hereunder, in each case at its own expense; provided that,
absent an actual or potential conflict of interest, in which case such
Indemnified Party shall control and appoint its own lead counsel at Parent's
or the Surviving Corporation's expense, as applicable, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel
for such defense. Parent's and the Surviving Corporation's obligations under
this Section 5.10(b) shall continue in full force and effect for the period
beginning upon the acceptance for payment of, and payment by Merger Sub for,
any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and ending six years from the
Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any Proceeding asserted or made within such period shall continue
until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The Company's directors and officers liability insurance policies in
effect at the Effective Time shall continue in force until their regular
expiration dates (or such other date at mutually agreed upon by Company and
Parent) with respect to acts or omissions prior to the Effective Time. Prior
to the Effective Time, Company shall (and if the Company fails to, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) arrange for and purchase a six-year
prepaid non-cancellable extension or runoff period (a "tail," runoff period or
extended reporting period) at Company's expense and at no cost to the
beneficiaries thereof on terms and conditions providing substantially
equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the
Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated
herein; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be
required to, and, without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company may
not, expend therefor in excess of 300% of the annualized premium, in the
aggregate, for such policies in force at the Effective Time; provided,
however, that if such prepaid tail, runoff period or extended reporting period
is not available at a cost per year equal to or less than 300% or less of the
annualized premium, in the aggregate, for such policies in force at the
Effective Time, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall
purchase the best coverage as available for such amount. Parent shall cause
such tail, runoff period or extended reporting period to be maintained in full
force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to
be honored by the Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

(d) Parent shall or shall cause to be paid all reasonable expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.

  


 

  

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the obligations
under this Section 5.10 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party without the consent of such
Indemnified Party.

  


 

  

(f) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.10.

  


 

  

(g) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time to) honor and perform in all respects to
the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, in accordance with their
respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section 5.10.

  


 

  

Section 5.11 Merger Sub. Parent will take all actions necessary to (a) cause
Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the Offer and the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement and (b) cause the Surviving Corporation to perform its obligations
under this Agreement.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  


    

Section 5.12 Control of Operations. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the Company's operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

 

  

  

Section 5.13 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) shall be permitted to take such steps
as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause dispositions of
Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

  


 

  

Section 5.14 Rule 14d-10 Matters. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, after the date of
this Agreement, enter into, establish, amend or modify any plan, program,
agreement or arrangement pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or
pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to any current or future
director, officer or employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who holds
shares of Common Stock or Company Options unless, prior to the expiration of
the Offer, the Company Compensation Committee shall have taken all steps as
may be necessary to (i) approve as an Employment Compensation Arrangement each
such plan, program, agreement or arrangement and (ii) satisfy the requirements
of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange
Act with respect to such plan, program, agreement or arrangement.

  


 

  

Section 5.15 Transaction Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in, review and comment on all material filings or
responses to be made by the Company in the defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company or any of its directors or officers
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, and no such settlement of any
stockholder litigation shall be agreed to without Parent's prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
provided that Parent shall not be required to consent to any such settlement
that does not include an unconditional release of the Parent and Merger Sub).
The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the commencement of any such
stockholder litigation of which it has received notice.

  


 

  

Section 5.16 Financing.

  


 

  

(a) Prior to the Merger Closing, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use its
commercially reasonable efforts, and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its Representatives to use their commercially reasonable
efforts, in each case at Parent's sole expense, to provide such customary
cooperation to Parent and Merger Sub as may be reasonably required or
requested in connection with the Financing, including (i) to the extent not
included in the Company SEC Documents, furnishing Parent and Merger Sub and
their Financing Sources (A) audited consolidated financial statements of the
Company covering the three (3) fiscal year period ended September 30, 2014,
(B) within 40 days after the end of any fiscal quarter ending after the date
hereof that is not a fiscal year end, with the unaudited consolidated balance
sheet of the Company as of the end of such quarter and the related unaudited
statements of income and cash flows, which shall have been reviewed by the
Company's accountants as provided in SAS 100, (C) within 60 days after the end
of any fiscal year ending after the date hereof with the audited consolidated
balance sheet of the Company as of the end of such fiscal year and the related
audited statements of income and cash flows and (D) such other financial and
other information as Parent shall reasonably request in order to consummate
the Financing, including customary authorization letters to the Financing
Sources authorizing the distribution of information pertaining to the Company
and its Subsidiaries to prospective lenders and a representation that any
public-side version of such information does not include material nonpublic
information, (ii) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
consents, approvals and authorizations which shall be reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the Financing, as well as facilitating the repayment
of agreed upon existing Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
releases of any Liens securing existing Indebtedness of the Company and its

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Subsidiaries by delivering any notices, payoff letters or similar instruments
reasonably requested by Parent, in each case upon the repayment of such
Indebtedness substantially concurrently with the initial funding of the
Financing; provided, however, that in no event shall this Section 5.16(a)(ii)
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to cause the Company's existing
credit agreements to be terminated unless the earlier of the Offer Closing and
the Merger Closing shall occur substantially concurrently with such
termination, and the Company or its Subsidiaries have received funds from
Parent to pay in full the payoff amount for such Indebtedness, (iii)
cooperating with the marketing efforts for the Financing (including by way of
causing management, officers and advisors to participate in a reasonable and
limited number of due diligence sessions and other meetings related to the
Financing on reasonable advance written notice), (iv) using commercially
reasonable efforts to assist in obtaining such legal opinions and comfort
letters and consents from accountants for the use of their reports and
materials as reasonably requested by Parent, (v) providing Parent with all
documentation and other information required by regulatory authorities and as
reasonably requested by Parent on behalf of Financing Sources with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA
PATRIOT ACT, Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001),
and (vi) preparing and delivering to Parent any supplements to the above
information as may be required pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter;
provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall (1) be
required to waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or to pay any
commitment or other similar fee in connection with the Financing, (2) have
(until the Merger Closing but only if the Merger occurs) any liability or
obligation under any loan agreement or certifications or any related document
or any other agreement or document related to the Financing, (3) be required
to give any indemnities in connection with the Financing that are effective
prior to the Effective Time or to incur (until the Merger Closing but only if
the Merger Closing occurs) any other liability (other than out-of pocket
expenses in connection with cooperation with the Parent and the Merger Sub
contemplated by this Section 5.16, it being understood that all such out-of-
pocket expenses shall be subject to reimbursement by Parent in accordance with
the following sentence) in connection with the Financing, (4) take any action
that, in the good faith determination of the Company, would unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business or the Company and its Subsidiaries
or create an unreasonable risk of damage or destruction to any property or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (5) provide any information
the disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted under applicable Law or is
legally privileged, or (6) take any action that will conflict with or violate
its organizational documents or any applicable Laws or would result in a
violation or breach of, or default under, any Contract to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (7) except only as will be effective at
the Offer Closing, take any corporate action approving, or executing any
document or agreement relating to, the Financing. If this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 7.1, Parent shall, reasonably promptly
upon written request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket costs to the extent such costs are incurred by
the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation provided
by the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives pursuant
to the terms of this Section 5.16, or in connection with compliance with its
obligations under this Section 5.16, and Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
from and against any and all liabilities and costs suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information
utilized in connection therewith (other than arising from information provided
by the Company or its Subsidiaries), except in the event such Losses arose out
of or result from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives.
Nothing in this Section 5.16 will require any officer or Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate or opinion or
take any other action that could reasonably be expected to result in personal
liability to such officer or Representative.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries'
trademarks, service marks and logos in connection with the marketing of the
Financing (including in any rating agency presentation, bank information
memoranda, offering memoranda and/or any private placement memoranda) so long
as such trademarks, service marks and logos (i) are used solely in a manner
that is not intended to or likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and (ii) are used solely in connection with a description of the
Company, its business and products or the Transactions.

  


 

  

(c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to use, its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Commitment Letter (or with terms and conditions agreed
by Parent and the Financing Sources subject to restrictions on amendments of
the Debt Commitment Letter set forth below), including using commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii)
negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and subject
only to the conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (or on other
terms and conditions agreed by Parent and the Financing Sources subject to
restrictions on amendments of the Debt Commitment Letter set forth below) and
(iii) satisfy (or obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the Financing set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements relating to the
Financing (including by providing the information required by Section (viii)
of Exhibit B to the Debt Commitment Letter to the Financing Sources no later
than the date that is four Business Days after the date on which the Offer is
commenced). If all conditions to the Financing have been satisfied, Parent and
Merger Sub shall take all actions reasonably within their control to cause the
Financing Sources to fund on or prior to the Offer Closing (with respect to
amounts required to consummate the Offer) and the Merger Closing (with respect
to amounts required to consummate the Merger). Parent shall not, and shall not
permit Merger Sub to, take any action not otherwise required or expressly
permitted under this Agreement that is a material breach of, or would result
in termination of the Debt Commitment Letter. If any portion of the Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letter, Parent shall, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange
to obtain Alternative Financing in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with Section
5.16(f).

  


 

  

(d) Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of (i) any material default or
breach (or any event that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would reasonably be expected to give rise to any material default or breach)
by any party under the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, (ii)
any termination of the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) the receipt of any
written notice or other written communication from any Person with respect to
any (x) actual or potential default, breach, termination or repudiation of the
Debt Commitment Letter, any definitive agreement relating to the Financing or
any provision of the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing, in each case by any party thereto, or (y) material
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing; provided, that
Parent shall not be under any obligation to disclose any information that is
subject to attorney client or similar privilege to the extent such privilege
is asserted in good faith, and (iv) if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub
believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion
of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements relating to the
Financing, as the case may be. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
date the Company delivers to Parent or Merger Sub a written request, Parent
and Merger Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by the
Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or
(iv) of the immediately preceding sentence. Parent shall keep the Company
informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Financing.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(e) Parent shall have the right, at its option, to amend, restate, supplement
or modify, or waive any of its rights under, the Debt Commitment Letter or the
definitive agreements relating to the Financing; provided, however, that it
shall not agree to or permit any amendments, restatements, supplements, or
modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other provision
under the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements relating to the
Financing without the prior written consent of the Company if such amendments,
supplements, modifications or waivers would (i) with respect to the Debt
Commitment Letter, reduce (or would reasonably be expected to have the effect
of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by increasing
the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Financing but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the entering into definitive agreements
relating to the Financing that reduce the aggregate amount available under the
Debt Commitment Letter) by an amount that would be reasonably likely to
prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation
of the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend
or modify any of the conditions to the Financing relative to those contained
in the Debt Commitment Letter, or otherwise expand, amend or modify any other
provision of the Debt Commitment Letter that would be reasonably likely to
prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation
of the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (iii) otherwise be reasonably likely to (x) prevent or
materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
(y) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive
agreements relating to the Financing; provided that notwithstanding the
foregoing Parent may amend, restate, supplement or modify the Debt Commitment
Letter or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing to add lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, underwriters, syndication agents, lenders or
similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the
date hereof, to provide for the assignment and reallocation of a portion of
the debt financing commitments contained therein and to grant customary
approval rights to such additional arrangers and other entities in connection
with such appointments, in each case, as expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company true and
complete copies of any such amendment, modification, supplement or waiver or
documents relating to such Financing (with only the fee amounts and certain
other provisions redacted, which redacted provisions do not relate to the
aggregate amount of or conditionality of, or contain any conditions precedent
to, the Financing).

  


 

  

(f) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable or Parent becomes
aware of any event or circumstance that makes or would reasonably be expected
to make any portion of the Financing unavailable, and such portion is required
to fund the aggregate Offer Price, Merger Consideration and all fees, expenses
and other amounts contemplated to be paid by Parent pursuant to this
Agreement, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and
obtain, and negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to,
alternative financing from the Financing Sources or, as the case may be,
alternative financial institutions in an amount sufficient (together with cash
available to the Company) to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement ("Alternative Financing") upon terms and conditions no less
favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent and, with respect to the amounts
available under, and the conditionality of, such Alternative Financing, the
Company, than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter, as applicable, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
occurrence of such event. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company true
and complete copies of all Contracts or other arrangements relating to such
Alternative Financing, and Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the Company
informed on a timely basis in reasonable detail of the status of the Financing
and any material developments relating to the Financing, including providing
to the Company all drafts and copies of definitive agreements with respect to
the Financing and all other material documents related to the Financing (with
only the fee amounts and certain other provisions redacted, which redacted
provisions do not relate to the aggregate amount of or, conditionality of, or
contain any conditions precedent to, the Financing).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(g) If any condition or other provision of the Debt Commitment Letter is
amended, modified or waived or if Alternative Financing is obtained for any
portion of the Financing, in each case, in accordance with Sections 5.16(e)
and (f), then each of Parent and the Company shall comply with its covenants
set forth herein with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter, as so amended,
modified or waived and with respect to such Alternative Financing to the same
extent that Parent and the Company would have been obligated to comply with
respect to the Financing, as the case may be.

  


 

  

(h) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that none of the receipt of
the Financing or any Alternative Financing, or the completion of any issuance
of securities contemplated by the Financing is a condition of the Merger
Closing.

ARTICLE VII

  

TERMINATION

  


 

  

Section 7.1 Termination. Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and abandoned at any time
prior to the Effective Time:

  


 

  

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

  


 

  

(b) by either the Company or Parent if:

  


 

  

(i) (A) the Offer Closing shall not have occurred on or before May 15, 2015
(the "Termination Date") or (B) the Offer is terminated or withdrawn pursuant
to its terms and the terms of this Agreement without any shares of Common
Stock being purchased thereunder; provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(i) shall not be available
to a party whose failure to fulfill in any material respect its obligations
under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in the events
specified in this Section 7.1(b)(i); or (ii)if any Restraint having the effect
set forth in Section 6.1(a) shall be in effect and shall have become final and
non-appealable; provided, however, the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 7.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to a party if the issuance of
such final, non-appealable Restraint was primarily due to the failure of such
party, and in the case of Parent, including the failure of Merger Sub, to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement; or

  


 

  

(c) by the Company, if:

  


 

  

(i) Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A)
would reasonably be expected to materially impair, prevent or delay the
consummation by Parent or the Merger Sub of the Transactions and (B) cannot be
cured on or before the Termination Date or, if curable, is not cured by Parent
within (1) fifteen (15) days of receipt by Parent of written notice of such
breach or failure or (2) any shorter period of time that remains between the
date the Company provides written notice of such breach and the Termination
Date; provided, however, that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(i) if (x) it has
breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement or (y) the Offer Closing shall have occurred; it being acknowledged
and agreed that any termination by the Company pursuant to this Section
7.1(c)(i) shall not constitute a Change of Recommendation; or (ii)prior to the
Offer Closing in order to enter into, concurrently with the termination of
this Agreement, a definitive acquisition agreement relating to a transaction
that is a Superior Proposal in compliance with Section 5.4; provided that the
Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1(c)(ii) if the Company has not paid the Company Termination Fee to
Parent or caused the Company Termination Fee to be paid to Parent in
accordance with Section 7.3;

  


 

  

(iii) Merger Sub shall have failed to commence the Offer on or prior to the
date provided therefor in Section 1.1(a) or consummate the Offer in accordance
with Section 1.1; provided, however, that the Company shall not be permitted
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(iii) if Merger
Sub's failure to commence the Offer is primarily due to the Company's material
breach of this Agreement; or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  


 

  

(d) by Parent, if:

  


 

  

(i) (x) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any material
respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would
result in a failure of any Offer Condition set forth in clauses (ii) or (iii)
of paragraph (c) of Annex I to be satisfied and (B) cannot be cured on or
before the Termination Date or, if curable, is not cured by the Company within
(1) fifteen (15) days of receipt by the Company of written notice of such
breach or failure or (2) any shorter period of time that remains between the
date Parent provides written notice of such breach and the Termination Date or
(y) a Company Material Adverse Effect occurs or exists; provided, however,
that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 7.1(d)(i) if (x) it has breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements set forth in this Agreement or (y) the Offer Closing shall have
occurred; or

  

  

(ii) the Company shall have breached Section 5.4 in any material respect;
provided, however, that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(d)(ii) if the Offer Closing shall have
occurred; or

  

  

(iii) (x) the board of directors of the Company shall have effected a Change
of Recommendation or shall have failed to publicly reaffirm the Company
Recommendation within seven (7) Business Days of receipt of a written request
by Parent to provide such reaffirmation following the public announcement of
an Acquisition Proposal (provided, however, that such seven (7) Business Days
period shall be extended for an additional three (3) Business Days following
any material modification to such Acquisition Proposal occurring after receipt
of Parent's written request); or (y) the Company enters into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement; provided, however, that Parent shall not have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(d)(iii) if the Offer
Closing shall have occurred.

  


 

  

Section 7.2 Manner and Effect of Termination. In the event that this Agreement
is terminated and the Merger abandoned pursuant to Section 7.1, written notice
thereof shall be given to the other party or parties, specifying the
provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is made and the basis
therefor described in reasonable detail, and this Agreement shall forthwith
become null and void and of no effect without liability on the part of any
party hereto (or any of their respective Representatives), and all rights and
obligations of any party hereto shall cease; provided, however, that no such
termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages
resulting from any fraud or Willful Breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such
termination in which case the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all
remedies available at law or in equity; provided, further, that the
Confidentiality Agreement, this Section 7.2, and the provisions of Section
5.3(b) (Access; Confidentiality), Section 5.9 (Public Announcements), the
penultimate sentence of Section 5.16(a) (Financing), Section 7.3 (Termination
Payment) and Article VIII (Miscellaneous) shall survive any termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Willful Breach" means with respect to each party, an intentional and willful
material breach, or an intentional and willful material failure to perform, in
each case that is the consequence of an act or omission by such party with the
actual knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to take such act would
cause a breach of this Agreement; provided, that with respect to Parent and
Merger Sub, a Willful Breach shall expressly include the failure to pay for
any shares of Common Stock when Merger Sub is required to do so under this
Agreement.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

Section 7.3 Termination Payment. Any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding,

  


 

  

(a) If, but only if, the Agreement is terminated by:

  


 

  

(i) either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) and (A) an
Acquisition Proposal has been made to the Company after the date hereof and
prior to the Termination Date and has been publicly made or publicly
disclosed, and (B) within twelve (12) months of the termination of this
Agreement, the Company (1) enters into a definitive agreement for the
consummation of an Acquisition Proposal (regardless of when such Acquisition
Proposal was initially made) and such Acquisition Proposal is subsequently
consummated (regardless of whether such consummation occurs within the twelve
(12) month period) or (2) consummates an Acquisition Proposal (regardless of
when such Acquisition Proposal was initially made) (provided, however, that
for purposes of this Section 7.3(a)(i), the references to "fifteen percent
(15%)" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
references to "fifty percent (50%)");

  


 

  

(ii) the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii); or

  

  

(iii) Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) or Section 7.1(d)(iii);

  

  

then, the Company shall, (A) in the case of clause (i) above, no later than
two (2) Business Days after the date on which the Company consummates such
Acquisition Proposal, (B) in the case of clause (ii) above, concurrently with
termination, and (C) in the case of clause (iii) above, no later than two (2)
Business Days after the date of such termination, pay to Parent the Company
Termination Fee in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
one or more accounts designated by Parent.

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
except in the event of fraud or a Willful Breach of Section 5.4 by the Company
and subject to Section 8.5 with respect to the enforcement of the provisions
of this Section 7.3, Parent's right to receive payment from the Company of the
Company Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall constitute the sole
and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its
subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers,
employees, agents, affiliates or assignees (collectively, the "Company
Specified Person") for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the
failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to
perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, none of the
Company Specified Persons shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions.

  

  

(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement. If the Company fails to timely pay an amount due pursuant to this
Section 7.3, the Company shall pay Parent interest on such amount at the prime
rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date such payment was actually
received.

with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with

obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be
entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether
in law or equity, including monetary damages) to (i) a decree or order of
specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant or obligation and (ii) an injunction restraining such breach or
threatened breach.

  


 

  

(b) Each party further agrees that (i) it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein

equity and (ii) no other party or any other Person shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 8.5, and

or to such other address as the party to receive such notice as provided above
shall specify by written notice so given, and such notice shall be deemed to
have been delivered to the receiving party as of the date so delivered or

specified in such notice or two (2) Business Days after the notice is given,
whichever is later. Rejection or other refusal to accept or the inability to

deemed to be receipt of the notice as of the date of such rejection, refusal
or inability to deliver.

  

  

Section 8.8 Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties except that the Merger Sub may assign, in
its sole discretion, any of or all of its rights, interests and obligations
under this Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent; provided that
no such assignment shall relieve Merger Sub of any of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this
Section 8.8 shall be null and void.

Section 8.9 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future
Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully
separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof,
(c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as
the economic or legal substance of the Offer and the Merger is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the Offer and the Merger be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  


 

  

Section 8.10 Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and
the exhibits and schedules hereto (including the Company Disclosure Letter)
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof. Except for Section 5.10 (which shall be for the benefit of
the Indemnified Parties) and as provided below and in Section 8.15, this
Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon
any person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, except for in the event the Effective Time shall have
occurred, the rights of the Company's stockholders and holders of Company
Options and Company Restricted Stock to receive the Merger Consideration and
the Option Cash Payment (as applicable) at the Effective Time and the other
payments contemplated by Section 2.3, which rights are hereby expressly
acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in
such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties
hereto in accordance with Section 8.11 without notice or liability to any
other person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with
particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Accordingly, persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

  


 

  

Section 8.11 Amendments; Waivers. This Agreement may be amended by mutual
agreement of the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their
respective boards of directors at any time before the Offer Closing shall have
occurred; provided that no amendment to Sections 8.4, 8.6, 8.10, 8.15 or this
Section 8.11 that in any way affects the rights of the Financing Sources shall
be effective except with the prior written consent of the Financing Sources to
such amendment. This Agreement may not be amended subsequent to the Offer
Closing. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed by each of the parties hereto. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject
to the proviso to the first sentence of this Section 8.11, waive compliance
with any agreement or condition contained herein. Any such extension or waiver
shall only be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right
hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such party.

(iv) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in all material

rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate or modify the Offer

discretion (other than the Minimum Tender Condition). The failure by Parent or
Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
