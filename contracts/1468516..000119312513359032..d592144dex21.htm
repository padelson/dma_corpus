immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

_Section 2.6_ _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary
or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either the Company or Merger Sub acquired or
to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of or in connection
with the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name of and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all
such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such
other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement.

_Section 2.7_ _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any further action on the part of the Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any holder of any shares of Common Stock or Preferred
Stock, but excluding any shares of Restricted Stock provided for in  _Section
2.9(e)_ (collectively, the " _Shares_ ") or any shares of capital stock of
Merger Sub:

(a) Each (i) Share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock,
Series B-1 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall, pursuant to
Section 2(f) of the Charter, be deemed to have converted into shares of Common
Stock in accordance with the

 



16  terms of the Charter and (ii) Share of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares and any
Dissenting Shares, but after giving effect for the conversion of the
Preferred Stock set forth above) shall be converted into the right to receive
the Gross Per Common Share Cash Merger Consideration, in cash, and the Closing
Per Common Share Stock Merger Consideration, together with any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section
2.10(h)_, in each case without interest, less any amounts that must be
contributed in respect of such Share of Common Stock into the Escrow Fund or
Expense Fund as provided in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, as
applicable, which contributed amounts will be released at the respective times
and subject to the contingencies specified herein and therein (the "
_Share Consideration_ ," and the aggregate amount of Share Consideration, the
" _Aggregate Share Consideration_ ");

(b) Each Share that is owned by the Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor; 

(c) Each Share that is held in the treasury of the Company or owned by the
Company or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in
exchange therefore (the Shares described in _Section 2.7(b)_ and this
_Section 2.7(c)_, " _Cancelled Shares_ "); and

(d) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one fully paid share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 _Section 2.8_ _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares (other than Cancelled Shares) outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a Holder who has not voted
in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has properly
demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware
Law or Chapter 13 of California Law, if such Section or Chapter provides for
appraisal rights for such Shares in the Merger (" _Dissenting Shares_ "),
shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive
a portion of the Merger Consideration unless and until such Holder fails to
perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his right to appraisal and payment
under Delaware Law or California Law. If, after the Effective Time, any such
Holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his right to appraisal, such
Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the portion of the Merger
Consideration, if any, to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.7(a)_, without interest. The Company shall give the Parent (a) prompt notice
of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, attempted
written withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to Delaware Law or California Law and received by

 



17  the Company relating to Holders rights to appraisal with respect to the
Merger and (b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any exercise of such appraisal rights under Delaware Law or
California Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any settlement of any such
negotiations or proceedings shall be handled as settlement of a Third Party
Claim pursuant to the procedures set forth in  _Section 8.4_. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Parent, voluntarily
make any payment with respect to any demands for payment of fair value for
capital stock of the Company, offer to settle or settle any such demands or
approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

_Section 2.9_ _Options; Restricted Stock; Warrant_.

 

(a) Each In-the-Money Option that is a Vested Option shall, as of the
Effective Time, be cancelled, terminated and converted into the right
to receive, and the Company shall pay to each former holder of any such
Vested Option (an " _Optionholder_ "), an amount in cash equal to the product
of (i) the excess, if any, of the sum of (x) the Gross Per Common Share
Cash Merger Consideration and (y) the Closing Per Common Share Stock Merger
Consideration (valuing such shares of Parent Common Stock using the Average
Parent Stock Price) over the applicable exercise price per Share of Common
Stock of such Vested Option and (ii) the number of Shares of Common Stock
previously subject to such Vested Option, less any amounts that must be
contributed in respect of such Vested Options into the Escrow Fund or Expense
Fund as provided in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, as applicable,
which contributed amounts will be released at the respective times and subject
to the contingencies specified herein and therein (the " _Option
Consideration_ ," and the aggregate amount of Option Consideration, the "
_Aggregate Option Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all Vested
Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically terminate and
cease to exist, and each holder of a Vested Option shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Option
Consideration, if any.

(b) At the Effective Time, the Company shall cause all outstanding Out-of-
the-Money Options that are Unvested Options to have their vesting accelerated
as to 100% of the Shares of Common Stock subject to all outstanding Out-of-
the-Money Options that are Unvested Options such that immediately prior to
the Effective Time all outstanding Out-of-the-Money Options that are Unvested
Options shall be fully vested and exercisable.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law,
each Out-of-the-Money Option shall be cancelled without consideration and
shall be of no further force and effect.

(d) At the Effective Time, to the extent not prohibited by applicable
Law, each single In-the-Money Option that is an Unvested Option shall be
cancelled, terminated and converted into the right to receive a fraction of a
number of restricted shares of Parent Common Stock (each a " _Converted
Restricted Share_ ") determined by dividing (i) the Closing Per Share Option
Spread for such Unvested Option by (ii) the Average Parent Stock Price. The
aggregate number of Converted Restricted Shares to be received by each holder
of a single grant of such Unvested

 



18  Options shall be determined on a grant by grant basis by multiplying the
fraction determined with respect to a single such Unvested Option by the
number of shares of Common Stock subject to the entire outstanding grant of
such Unvested Options, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole
share. If a holder holds more than one outstanding grant of such Unvested
Options, the total number of Converted Restricted Shares to be received by
such holder shall be the sum of the number of Converted Restricted Shares
determined for each such grant of Unvested Options as determined according to
the preceding sentence. The vesting schedule of Converted Restricted Shares
shall maintain the same vesting schedule (including any acceleration
provisions) as the grant of such Unvested Options from which it was converted.

 

(e) At the Effective Time, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law,
each share of Restricted Stock shall be converted into the right to receive a
number of Converted Restricted Shares determined by dividing (i) the Closing
Per Share Restricted Stock Amount by (ii) the Average Parent Stock Price. The
aggregate number of Converted Restricted Shares to be received by each holder
of any such Restricted Stock shall be determined on a grant by grant basis
with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share. The vesting
schedule of Converted Restricted Shares shall maintain the same vesting
schedule (including any acceleration provisions) of the Restricted Stock from
which it was converted.

(f) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (but no later than 20
Business Days), the Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or
any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the Converted
Restricted Shares. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as
any Parent Common Stock issued under this _Section 2.9_ remains outstanding.
Parent shall, within 20 Business Days after the Effective Time, deliver to
each holder of Converted Restricted Shares a written notice documenting the
number, vesting schedule, and other materially relevant terms related to such
Converted Restricted Shares.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 2.9_, it is
anticipated that all In-the-Money Vested Options held by individuals in the
United Kingdom (the " _Vested UK Options_ ") will be exercised to the extent
vested as of immediately prior to the Closing. Each share of Common Stock
issued on exercise thereof will convert at the Effective Time into the right
to receive the payments set forth in _Section 2.7(a)(ii)_; _provided_ , that,
such payment will have deducted from it an amount equal to the aggregate
exercise price (unless such exercise price is paid in cleared funds
on exercise by the relevant holder) which shall be paid to the Company
pursuant to the undertaking and direction from the holder in the exercise
agreement in respect of such holders Vested UK Options. The obligations of
such holder, if any, to pay the employer portion of any social security, NIC
or similar Tax shall be as provided in the Option grant agreement governing
such In-the-Money Vested Option.

 

(h) The Warrant shall, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled, terminated and
converted into the right to receive, and the Paying and Exchange Agent shall
pay the former Warrantholder an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the
excess, if any, of the sum of (x) the Gross Per Common Share Cash Merger
Consideration and (y) the Closing Per 

 



19  Common Share Stock Merger Consideration (valuing such shares of Parent
Common Stock using the Average Parent Stock Price) over the warrant price of
such Warrant and (ii) the number of Shares of Common Stock previously subject
to such Warrant, less with any amounts that must be contributed in respect of
such Warrant into the Escrow Fund or Expense Fund as provided in this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, as applicable, which contributed amounts
will be released at the respective times and subject to the contingencies
specified herein and therein (the " _Warrant Consideration_ "). As of the
Effective Time, the Warrant shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically terminated and cease to exist and the Warrantholder shall
ceases to have any rights with respect to the Warrant, except the right to
receive the consideration set forth in this _Section 2.9(h)_.

 

 _Section 2.10_ _Payment for Shares and Options_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall designate, and the Company
shall appoint, a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company
to act as paying and exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the "
_Paying and Exchange Agent_ ") pursuant to a paying and exchange agent
agreement providing for, among other things, the matters set forth in this 
_Section 2.10_ and otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the Company.
Immediately following the Effective Time, the Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, deposit with the Paying and Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the Holders, (i) cash in an amount equal to the Aggregate Share
Consideration (for clarity excluding the portion thereof represented by shares
of Parent Common Stock), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
such account or accounts as may be designated in writing by the Paying and
Exchange Agent at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (ii) a
certificate or certificates (or electronic book-entry record) representing the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Aggregate Share
Consideration (for clarity excluding the portion thereof represented by cash),
and (iii) cash in an amount equal to the cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to  _Section 2.10(h)_. Such cash
shall be invested as directed by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, pending payment thereof by the Paying and Exchange Agent to
the Holders. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive
property of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, and
no part thereof shall accrue to the benefit of Holders. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, losses from such investments shall
be borne solely by the Parent.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying and Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a certificate or certificates that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, evidenced outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ," which
Certificates in the case of Preferred Stock shall represent both the
Preferred Stock evidenced by such Shares and any Common Stock, on an as-
converted basis, represented by such Shares) and whose Shares were converted
with the right to receive the consideration described in  _Section 2.7(a)_,
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying and Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as

 



20  the Parent may specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment therefor. Upon surrender
of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying and Exchange Agent or such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Parent, together with such
letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (as promptly as practicable) (A) the
Gross Per Common Share Cash Merger Consideration and Closing Per Common Share
Stock Merger Consideration _multiplied by_ (B) the number of Shares of Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate (less any amounts that must be
contributed in respect of such Shares of Common Stock into the Escrow Fund or
Expense Fund as provided in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, as
applicable), without interest, and all such Certificates shall, upon
such surrender, be cancelled. Each such Holder shall also be entitled to any
amounts that may be payable in respect of the Shares formerly represented by
such Certificate from the Escrow Fund or the Expense Fund as provided in this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, as applicable, at the respective times
and subject to the contingencies specified herein and therein. If payment in
respect of any Certificate is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name such Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer, that the signatures on such
Certificate or any related stock power shall be properly guaranteed and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have established to the satisfaction
of the Parent and the Paying and Exchange Agent that any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of such payment to a Person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate have been paid or are not
applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 2.10_, any Certificate (other than Certificates representing
Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed, at any time after the
Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the portion of the
Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto, in cash, without interest,
as contemplated herein.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of any shares
of capital stock thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the
Effective Time, a Certificate (other than one representing Cancelled Shares)
is presented to the Surviving Corporation, it shall be cancelled and exchanged
as provided in this _Section 2.10_.

(d) All consideration paid upon conversion of the Shares in accordance with
the terms of this  _Article II_ and all cash deposited with the Escrow Agent
pursuant to this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights
with respect to Shares represented thereby, except as otherwise provided
herein or by applicable Law. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to
prevent the treatment of any portion of the Merger Consideration that is not
paid at the Closing, including amounts deposited with the Escrow Agent, as a
deferred payment, eligible for installment method treatment under Section 453
of the Code, and the parties agree to treat such deferred payments
accordingly. The parties acknowledge that a portion of such deferred payments
may be characterized as imputed interest under the Code.

 



21 (e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the relevant portion of the Merger Consideration payable
in respect thereof pursuant to  _Section 2.10(b)_ for Shares represented
thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
and Exchange Agent may, in their discretion, require the delivery of a
satisfactory indemnity.

 

(f) At any time following the date that is six months after the Effective
Time, the Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying and Exchange Agent
to deliver to it any funds (including any interest or other income received
with respect thereto) and any shares of Parent Common Stock that had been made
available to the Paying and Exchange Agent and that have not been disbursed
to holders of Certificates, or any Certificates or other documents relating
to the Merger in its possession, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled
to look to the Parent only as general creditors thereof with respect to any
portion of the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates, without interest; _provided_ that any such portion of the Merger
Consideration payable from the Escrow Fund or Expense Fund shall be held and
distributed to the Person(s) entitled thereto in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, as applicable, at the respective
times and subject to the contingencies specified herein and therein.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section 2.10_, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, none of the Paying and Exchange
Agent, the Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder
of a Certificate for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(g) All cash payments to be made under this  _Section 2.10_ shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
holder of the Shares, as the case may be, except as otherwise agreed by the
payor and payee. Wire instructions shall be provided to the Surviving
Corporation at least two Business Days prior to the applicable payment date.

(h) No fractions of a share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the
Merger, but in lieu thereof each Holder otherwise entitled to a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock shall, upon surrender of his or her Certificate
or Certificates pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_, be entitled to receive an
amount of cash (without interest) determined by multiplying the Average Parent
Stock Price by the fractional share interest to which such Holder would
otherwise be entitled.

 

(i) Any certificates evidencing shares of Parent Common Stock delivered
hereunder shall include legends legally required, including a
legend substantially in the following form:

"THE TRANSFERABILITY OF THESE SECURITIES IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTION. THESE
SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR THE
SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE AND MAY BE REOFFERED

 



22  AND SOLD ONLY IF SO REGISTERED OR IF AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION IS
AVAILABLE. THESE SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO CONTRACTUAL LIMITATIONS ON RESALE
AS PROVIDED IN THE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, DATED AS OF AUGUST 5, 2013
BY AND AMONG AOL INC., CARMEL MERGER CORPORATION, ADAP.TV, INC. AND
SHAREHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE SERVICES LLC."

 

 _Section 2.11_ _Other Closing Payments_.

 

(a) As part of the Merger Consideration, concurrently with the Effective Time,
the Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited:

 

(i) with the Escrow Agent (A) for deposit into the Escrow Fund, the Escrow
Amount, and (B) the Expense Fund (it being understood that the Escrow Amount
and Expense Fund will be withheld from amounts otherwise payable to the
Holders, Optionholders and Warrantholder according to their respective Pro
Rata Percentages);

 

(ii) with the Company, the Aggregate Option Consideration for payment through
the Companys payroll system at the next reasonably practicable payroll
cycle, but in no event later than the first full payroll cycle following the
Closing Date;

 

(iii) with the Paying and Exchange Agent, the Warrant Consideration;

 

(iv) on behalf of the Company, the amount payable to each counterparty or
holder of Funded Indebtedness in order to fully discharge such Funded
Indebtedness and terminate all applicable obligations and liabilities of the
Company and any of its Affiliates related thereto, as specified in the Debt
Payoff Letters and in accordance with this Agreement; and

 

(v) on behalf of the Company, the amount payable to each Person who is owed a
portion of the Estimated Transaction Expenses, as specified in the
Transaction Expenses Payoff Instructions and in accordance with this
Agreement.

(b) All payments hereunder shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in United States dollars to such account as may be designated
to the payor by the payee at least two Business Days prior to the applicable
payment date.

 

 _Section 2.12_ _Closing Estimates_. At least five Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and deliver to the Parent a written statement (the " _Preliminary Closing
Statement_ ") that shall include and set forth (i) a good-faith estimate of

 



23  (A) Cash (the " _Estimated Cash_ "), (B) Non-Cash Net Working Capital (the "
_Estimated Non-Cash Net Working Capital_ "), (C) Indebtedness (the "
_Estimated Indebtedness_ ") and (D) all Transaction Expenses that are accrued
or due and remain unpaid (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ ") (with each
of Estimated Cash, Estimated Non-Cash Net Working Capital, Estimated
Indebtedness and Estimated Transaction Expenses determined as of the Closing
Date and, except for Estimated Transaction Expenses, without giving effect to
the transactions contemplated herein) (ii) on the basis of the foregoing,
a calculation of the Closing Cash Merger Consideration, the Closing Stock
Merger Consideration, the Escrow Amount, the Aggregate Share Consideration,
the Aggregate Option Consideration and the Warrant Consideration and (iii) the
Average Parent Stock Price. Estimated Non-Cash Net Working Capital, Estimated
Cash and Estimated Indebtedness shall be calculated on a basis consistent with
the Applicable Accounting Principles. All such estimates shall be subject to
the Parents approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and shall
control solely for purposes of determining the amounts payable at the Closing
pursuant to _Sections 2.10(a)_ and _2.11_ and shall not limit or otherwise
affect the Parents remedies under this Agreement or otherwise, or constitute
an acknowledgement by the Parent of the accuracy of the amounts reflected
thereof.

 

 _Section 2.13_ _Post-Closing Adjustment of Closing Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall
prepare and deliver to the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the
Holders, Optionholders and Warrantholder) a written statement (the " _Final
Closing Statement_ ") that shall include and set forth (i) a calculation of
the actual (A) Cash (the " _Closing Cash_ "), (B) Non-Cash Net Working
Capital (the " _Closing Non-Cash Net Working Capital_ "), (C) Indebtedness
(the " _Closing Indebtedness_ ") and (D) Transaction Expenses (the " _Closing
Transaction Expenses_ ") (with each of Closing Cash, Closing Non-Cash Net
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Transaction Expenses
determined as of the Closing Date and, except for Closing Transaction
Expenses, without giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein).
Closing Cash, Closing Non-Cash Net Working Capital and Closing Indebtedness
shall be calculated on a basis consistent with the Applicable Accounting
Principles. The Preliminary Closing Statement shall become final and binding
on the 90th day following the Closing Date, unless prior to the end of such
period, Parent delivers to the Securityholder Representative the Final Closing
Statement specifying the nature and amount of any dispute as to the
Estimated Cash, Estimated Non-Cash Net Working Capital, Estimated
Indebtedness or Estimated Transaction Expenses, as set forth in the
Preliminary Closing Statement. Parent shall be deemed to have agreed with all
items and amounts of Estimated Cash, Estimated Non-Cash Net Working Capital,
Estimated Indebtedness or Estimated Transaction Expenses not specifically
referenced in the Final Closing Statement, and such items and amounts shall
not be subject to review in accordance with this  _Section 2.13_. Any Final
Closing Statement may reference only disagreements based on mathematical
errors or based on amounts of the Estimated Cash, Estimated Non-Cash Net
Working Capital, Estimated Indebtedness or 

 



24  Estimated Transaction Expenses as reflected on the Preliminary Closing
Statement not being calculated in accordance with _Section 2.12_ or the
Applicable Accounting Principles, as applicable.

(b) The Final Closing Statement shall become final and binding at the end of
the 30th day following delivery thereof, unless prior to the end of such
period, the Securityholder Representative delivers to the Parent written
notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") specifying the
nature and amount of any dispute as to the Closing Cash, Closing Non-Cash Net
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness or Closing Transaction Expenses, as set
forth in the Final Closing Statement. The Securityholder Representative shall
be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts of Closing Cash, Closing
Non-Cash Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness or Closing Transaction
Expenses not specifically referenced in the Notice of Disagreement, and such
items and amounts shall not be subject to review in accordance with  _Section
2.13(c)_. Any Notice of Disagreement may reference only disagreements based on
mathematical errors or based on amounts of the Closing Cash, Closing Non-Cash
Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness or Closing Transaction Expenses as
reflected on the Final Closing Statement not being calculated in accordance
with _Section 2.12_, the Applicable Accounting Principles or the Preliminary
Closing Statement, as applicable.

 

(c) During the 15 day period following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement by
the Securityholder Representative to the Parent, the parties in good faith
shall seek to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with
respect to the computation of the Closing Cash, Closing Non-Cash Net Working
Capital, Closing Indebtedness or Closing Transaction Expenses as specified
therein. Any disputed items resolved in writing between the Securityholder
Representative and the Parent within such 15 day period shall be final and
binding with respect to such items, and if the Securityholder Representative
and the Parent agree in writing on the resolution of each disputed item
specified by the Securityholder Representative in the Notice of Disagreement
and the amount of the Closing Cash, Closing Non-Cash Net Working Capital,
Closing Indebtedness and Closing Transaction Expenses, the amounts so
determined shall be final and binding on the parties for all purposes
hereunder. If the Securityholder Representative and the Parent have not
resolved all such differences by the end of such 15 day period, the
Securityholder Representative and the Parent shall submit, in writing, to an
independent public accounting firm (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "),
their briefs detailing their views as to the correct nature and amount of each
item remaining in dispute and the amounts of the Closing Cash, Closing Non-
Cash Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Transaction
Expenses, and the Independent Accounting Firm shall make a written
determination as to each such disputed item and the amount of the Closing
Cash, Closing Non-Cash Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing
Transaction Expenses, which determination shall be final and binding on the
parties for all purposes hereunder. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall consider only those items and amounts in the Securityholder
Representatives and the Parents respective calculations of the Closing Cash,
Closing Non-Cash Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing
Transaction Expenses that are identified as being items and amounts to which
the Securityholder Representative and the Parent have been unable to agree. In
resolving any disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm may not assign
a 

 



25  value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
party. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other nationally
recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed in writing by
the Securityholder Representative and the Parent. The Securityholder
Representative and the Parent shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to render a written decision
resolving the matters submitted to it within 30 days following the submission
thereof. Judgment may be entered upon the written determination of the
Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with _Section 10.10_. In acting
under this Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm will be entitled to the
privileges and immunities of an arbitrator.

(d) The costs of any dispute resolution pursuant to _Section 2.13(c)_,
including the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm and of any
enforcement of the determination thereof, shall be borne by the Securityholder
Representative (on behalf of the Holders, Optionholders and Warrantholder) and
the Parent in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved
by the Independent Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocation shall be
calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the
amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the Independent Accounting Firm
at the time the determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the
matters submitted. The fees and disbursements of the Representatives of each
party incurred in connection with the preparation or review of the Final
Closing Statement and preparation or review of any Notice of Disagreement, as
applicable, shall be borne by such party.

(e) The Company shall, during the period prior to the Closing Date, and the
Parent, during the period from and after the date of delivery of the Final
Closing Statement through the resolution of any adjustment to the Closing
Merger Consideration contemplated by this  _Section 2.13_, shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, afford the Parent or the Securityholder
Representative, as the case may be, and their respective Representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior
notice, to the personnel, properties, books and records of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, and its Subsidiaries and to any
other information reasonably requested for purposes of preparing and reviewing
the calculations contemplated by this _Section 2.13_. Each party shall
authorize its accountants to disclose work papers generated by such
accountants in connection with preparing and reviewing the calculations of
Cash, Non-Cash Net Working Capital, Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses as
specified in this _Section 2.13_; _provided_ that such accountants shall not
be obligated to make any work papers available except in accordance with such
accountants disclosure procedures and then only after the non-client party
has signed a customary agreement relating to access to such work papers in
form and substance acceptable to such accountants.

 

(f) The Closing Merger Consideration shall be adjusted, upwards or downwards,
as follows:

 

(i) For the purposes of this Agreement, the " _Net Adjustment Amount_ " means
an amount, which may be positive or negative, equal to (A) Closing Cash as
finally

 



26  determined pursuant to this _Section 2.13_ _minus_ the Estimated Cash,
_plus_ (B) the Closing Non-Cash Net Working Capital as finally determined
pursuant to this  _Section 2.13_ _minus_ the Estimated Non-Cash Net Working
Capital, _plus_ (C) the Estimated Indebtedness _minus_ the Closing
Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.13_, _plus_
 (D) the Estimated Transaction Expenses _minus_ the Closing Transaction
Expenses as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.13_;

 

(ii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, the Closing Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted upwards in an amount equal to the Net
Adjustment Amount. In such event, the Parent shall pay the Net Adjustment
Amount to (A) the Paying and Exchange Agent for delivery to the Holders (other
than holders of any Dissenting Shares), (B) the Surviving Corporation
for delivery to the Optionholders through the Surviving Corporations payroll
system and (C) the Paying and Exchange Agent for delivery to the
Warrantholder. Payment of such amounts to Holders, Optionholders and the
Warrantholder shall be made pro rata in accordance with their respective Pro
Rata Percentages; and

(iii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative (in which case the "Net
Adjustment Amount" for purposes of this _clause (iii)_ shall be deemed to be
equal to the absolute value of such amount), the Closing Merger Consideration
shall be adjusted downwards in an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount.
In such event, the Parent shall deliver written notice to the Escrow Agent and
the Securityholder Representative specifying the Net Adjustment Amount, and
the Escrow Agent shall pay the Net Adjustment Amount out of the Escrow Fund
to the Parent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(g) Amounts paid pursuant to _Section 2.13(f)_ shall bear interest from the
Closing Date to the date of such payment at a rate equal to the rate of
interest from time to time announced publicly by Citibank as its prime rate,
calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days and the number of days
elapsed. Payments in respect of _Section 2.13(f)_ shall be made within three
Business Days of final determination of the Net Adjustment Amount pursuant to
the provisions of this _Section 2.13_ by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such account or accounts as may be designated in writing
by the party entitled to such payment at least two Business Days prior to such
payment date, subject to any requirements of the Escrow Agent. For the
avoidance of doubt, claims relating to the determination of Closing Cash,
Closing Non-Cash Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Transaction Expenses and the Net Adjustment Amount shall be governed solely by
this _Section 2.13_, which shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent for such claims.

_Section 2.14_ _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying and Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the

 



27  Code, or any provision of applicable tax Law. To the extent that such
amounts are so withheld and paid over to or deposited with the relevant
Governmental Authority by the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
and Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in respect to
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

 _Section 2.15_ _Securityholder Representative_.

 

(a) Immediately upon the approval of this Agreement by the Company Holder
Approval, each Holder shall be deemed to have consented to the appointment of
Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the Holders, Optionholders and
Warrantholders representative and attorney-in-fact (the " _Securityholder
Representative_ "), with full power of substitution to act on behalf of the
Holders, Optionholders and Warrantholder to the extent and in the manner set
forth in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. All decisions, actions,
consents and instructions by the Securityholder Representative shall
be binding upon all of the Holders, Optionholders and Warrantholder and no
such Person shall have the right to object to, dissent from, protest or
otherwise contest any such decision, action, consent or instruction. The
Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to rely on any decision, action,
consent or instruction of the Securityholder Representative as being the
decision, action, consent or instruction of the Holders, Optionholders and
Warrantholder, and the Parent and Merger Sub are hereby relieved from any
liability to any Person for acts done by them in accordance with any such
decision, act, consent or instruction. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 2.15_ to the contrary, unless Holders, Optionholders
and Warrantholder holding a majority of the aggregate Fully Diluted Share
Number as of the Effective Time (the " _Majority Holders_ ") shall have
notified Parent and the Securityholder Representative in writing to the
contrary, the Securityholder Representative shall not be empowered or
authorized to act as the Holders, Optionholders or Warrantholders agent or
attorney-in-fact with respect to any claim for indemnification made pursuant
to _Article VIII_  to the extent such claim seeks recovery from the Holders,
Optionholders and Warrantholder directly.

(b) The Securityholder Representative may resign at any time, and may be
removed for any reason or no reason by the vote or written consent of the
Majority Holders. In the event of the death, incapacity, resignation or
removal of the Securityholder Representative, a new
Securityholder Representative shall be appointed by the vote or written
consent of the Majority Holders. Notice of such vote or a copy of the written
consent appointing such new Securityholder Representative shall be sent to the
Parent and, after the Effective Time, to the Surviving Corporation, such
appointment to be effective upon the later of the date indicated in such
consent or the date such consent is received by the Parent and, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_  that until such notice
is received, the Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall be entitled to rely on the decisions, actions, consents and
instructions of the prior Securityholder Representative as described in 
_Section 2.15(a)_. The Securityholder Representative may charge a reasonable
fee for its services; _provided_ that all fees and expenses incurred by the
Securityholder Representative in performing its duties hereunder (including
legal fees and expenses related thereto) (other than the Securityholder
Representatives engagement fee) and any indemnification in favor of the
Securityholder Representative shall be borne by the Holders, Optionholders and
Warrantholder.

 



28 (c) The Securityholder Representative shall not be liable to the Holders,
Optionholders and Warrantholder for actions taken or omitted in connection
with this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, except to the extent such actions
shall have been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
have constituted willful misconduct or fraud. Except in cases where a court
of competent jurisdiction has made such a finding, the Holders, Optionholders
and Warrantholder shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Securityholder Representative from and against any and all
losses, liabilities, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, damages,
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees (including the fees
and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense
of document location, duplication and shipment) and disbursements
(collectively, " _Representative Losses_ "), arising out of and in connection
with its activities as Securityholder Representative under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or otherwise, in each case as such Representative Losses are
suffered or incurred. If not paid directly to the Securityholder
Representative by the Holders, Optionholders and Warrantholder, any such
Representative Losses may be recovered by the Securityholder Representative
(i) first by distribution of the Expense Fund pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Escrow Agreement and (ii) after the exhaustion of the
amounts in the Expense Fund, from the amounts in the Escrow Fund, but only at
such time as such amounts in the Escrow Fund are otherwise distributable to
the Holders, Optionholders and Warrantholder pursuant to the terms hereof and
the Escrow Agreement because all claims for indemnification hereunder against
such amounts have been fully resolved, in accordance with written
instructions delivered by the Securityholder Representative to the Escrow
Agent; provided that while this _Section 2.15(c)_ allows the Securityholder
Representative to be paid from the Expense Fund and the Escrow Fund, this
does not relieve the Holders, Optionholders and Warrantholder from their
obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as such Representative
Losses are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Securityholder
Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise.

(d) The Securityholder Representative shall have reasonable access to
information about the Surviving Corporation and the reasonable assistance of
the Companys former officers and employees for purposes of performing its
duties and exercising its rights hereunder; provided, that, the
Securityholder Representative shall treat confidentially and not use or
disclose the terms of this Agreement or any nonpublic information from or
about the Surviving Corporation to anyone (except to the Holders,
Optionholders or Warrantholder or the Securityholder Representatives
employees, attorneys, accountants, advisors or authorized representatives on a
need to know basis, in each case who agree to treat such information
confidentially); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to provide such access or information
if it determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would jeopardize
the protection of attorney-client privilege. The Securityholder
Representative shall enter into a separate customary confidentiality agreement
(which shall contain the exceptions listed in the preceding parenthetical)
prior to being provided access to such information if reasonably requested
by Parent.

 



29 (e) The approval of this Agreement by the Company Holder Approval shall also
be deemed to constitute approval of all arrangements relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby and to the provisions hereof binding upon the
Holders, Optionholders and Warrantholder, including the representations and
warranties included in  _Section 3.24_ and the covenants and agreements
included in _Section 5.15_ and _Section 8.2_.

 

 _Section 2.16_ _Ancillary Acquisition Agreements_. The purchase and sale of
the International Transferred Shares will be effected pursuant to the
International Stock Purchase Agreement and the purchase and sale of the
International Transferred Assets will be effected pursuant to the
International Asset Purchase Agreement. The parties acknowledge that the
consideration to be paid by the Parent or one of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
each of the Ancillary Acquisition Agreements is included in the calculation of
Merger Consideration and upon the Parents payment of the Closing Merger
Consideration set forth herein any and all payments contemplated by each of
the Ancillary Acquisition Agreements shall be deemed paid in full, received by
the applicable selling parties under the Ancillary Acquisition Agreements and
distributed or paid by the Company as part of the Merger Consideration.

employee or individual consultant of the Company following such current or
former employees or individual consultants termination of employment or

the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(whether alone or in connection with any other events), could (i) result in
severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination
of employment or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in
any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation
or benefits under, increase the amount payable or result in any other material
obligation pursuant to, any of the Employee Plans.

(h) Each Employee Plan may be amended or terminated without liability to the
Company, other than liability for accrued benefits through the date of the

current or former employee, director, officer, stockholder or independent
contractor of the Company that, individually or collectively, could give rise

with the terms thereof and all applicable Laws and all Tax clearances and

with respect to such obligations; (iv) full payment has been made in a timely
manner of all amounts which are required to be made as contributions, payments
or premiums to or in respect of any International Employee Plan under

Plan is funded or book reserved, as appropriate, to the extent so required by
applicable Laws; (vi) no Taxes, penalties or fees are owing, assessable and

occurred with respect to any registered International Employee Plan that

Employee Plan, or which would entitle any Person (without the consent of the
sponsor of such International Employee Plan) to wind up or terminate any such
International Employee Plan, in whole or in part, or could otherwise
reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the Tax status of any such
International Employee Plan; (viii) there have been no withdrawals of assets
or transfers from any International Employee Plan, except in accordance with
applicable Laws; (ix) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any

(each an " _International Pension Plan_ ") and except as would not result in
material liability:

(i) The International Pension Plans set forth in _Schedule 3.10(l)(i)_ of the
Disclosure Schedules are the only arrangements under which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries has or may have any legally binding obligation to provide
or contribute towards Retirement Benefits in respect of International
Employee Plan Beneficiaries and no proposal or announcement has been made to
any such Person about the introduction, continuance, increase or improvement

Subsidiary has had an obligation to provide such benefits under any other
arrangement in the past.

usual terms for persons in good health.

(iii) The International Pension Plans each comply with and have
been administered in accordance with all applicable legal and administrative

Persons classified as independent contractors of the Company or its
Subsidiaries satisfy and have at all times satisfied the requirements of
applicable Law to be so classified. The Company has fully and accurately
reported such Persons compensation on IRS Forms 1099 or similar forms when
required to do so. Except as may be required under applicable Law with respect
to foreign Persons, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has and
has ever had any obligations to provide benefits with respect to such Persons
under any Employee Plan, International Employee Plan or otherwise. The Company
does not employ, and has not employed, any "leased employees" as defined in
Section 414(n) of the Code.

knowledge of the Company, no such investigation is in progress.

(g) There has not been, and the Company does not anticipate or have any reason

his employment relationship with such entity following the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(h) Neither the Company nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any of the
Companys or any Subsidiarys employees or consultants is obligated under any
Contract (including licenses, covenants or commitments of any nature) or
subject to any judgment, decree or order of any court or Governmental
Authority that would interfere with the use of such Persons best efforts to
promote the interests of the Company or that would conflict with the Companys

its Representatives complete access (including for inspection and copying) at
all reasonable times to the Representatives, properties, offices, plants and
other facilities, books and records of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries, and shall furnish the Parent with such financial, operating and
other data and information as the Parent may reasonably request.

 

 _Section 5.3_ _No-Shop_. The Company agrees that it shall not, and shall
take all action necessary to ensure that none of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Affiliates and Representatives shall, directly or indirectly
(a) solicit, initiate, consider, knowingly encourage or accept any proposal or
offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, (b) participate in any
discussions, conversations, negotiations or other communications regarding, or
furnish to any other Person any information with respect to, or otherwise
cooperate in any way, assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage the
submission of, any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal or (c) file a registration statement with
respect to the issuance of the Companys securities, including any amendments
to a previously filed registration statement, with the SEC. The Company
immediately shall cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions,
conversations, negotiations and other communications with any Persons
conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing. The Company shall
notify the Parent promptly, but in any event within 24 hours, orally and in
writing if any such Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or other contact with
any Person with respect thereto, is made. Any such notice to the Parent shall
indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or other contact and the terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or other contact, in any such case unless
doing so would violate a confidentiality, non-disclosure or similar obligation
by which the Company is bound). The Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, release any Person from, or waive any provision of, any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, without the prior written consent of the Parent. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any offer or
proposal for, or any indication of interest in, any of the following (other
than the Merger): (i) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of all or
any portion of the capital stock or other equity or ownership interest of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than inventory to be sold in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice), (ii) any merger, consolidation or
other business combination relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or (iii) any recapitalization, reorganization or any other extraordinary
business transaction involving or otherwise relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither (A) the conversion of shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common
Stock, nor (B) the issuance of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock upon
the valid exercise of Options or Warrant, shall (x) constitute an Acquisition
Proposal, (y) give rise to any obligation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to this _Section 5.3_, or (z) constitute an action
prohibited by this  _Section 5.3_.

 



61 _Section 5.4_ _Company Holder Approval_. Immediately following the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall distribute the Written
Consents for the purpose of obtaining the Company Holder Approval, and the
Company shall deliver evidence of the receipt of such Company Holder Approval
to the Parent.

 

 _Section 5.5_ _Information Statement_. As promptly as reasonably practicable
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall
mail to Holders that did not provide their Written Consent, as set forth in
_Section 5.4_, the Information Statement for such Holders to approve the
Merger, adopt this Agreement in accordance with Section 228 of Delaware Law
and to be informed of their rights under Section 262 of Delaware Law and
Chapter 13 of California Law. The Company shall promptly advise the Parent in
writing if at any time prior to the Effective Time the Company obtains
knowledge of any facts that might make it necessary or appropriate to amend or
supplement the Information Statement in order to make the statements contained
therein not misleading. The Information Statement shall contain the unanimous
recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company that the Holder
approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
the conclusion of the Board of Directors of the Company that the terms and
conditions of the Merger are fair and reasonable to the Holders. The Company
will provide copies of drafts of the Information Statement to the Parent and
will mail the Information Statement to Holders only after the Parent and its
legal counsel shall have approved and agreed to the content of the disclosure
of the Information Statement, which approval and agreement shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

 _Section 5.6_ _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give
prompt written notice to the Parent of (i) the occurrence of any change,
condition or event, the occurrence of which would cause the condition set
forth in the first sentence of _Section 7.3(a)_ to not be satisfied if such
change, condition or event occurred immediately prior to the Closing, (ii)
the occurrence of any Material Adverse Effect, (iii) any failure of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to perform any obligation or agreement or
comply with any covenant or condition required by this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement to which the Company is a party, which such failure
would cause the condition set forth in the second sentence of _Section
7.3(a)_ to not be satisfied if such failure occurred immediately prior to the
Closing, (iv) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements or (v) any Action pending or, to the Companys
knowledge, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements; provided however, that that the Companys unintentional failure
to give notice under this _Section 5.6_ shall not be deemed to be a breach of
covenant under this _Section 5.6_ but instead shall constitute only a breach
of the underlying representation or warranty or covenant or condition, as the
case may be.

_Section 5.7_ _Takeover Statutes_. If any state takeover statute or similar
Law shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Ancillary Agreements, the Company and its Board of Directors shall
grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby or thereby and otherwise act to
eliminate the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. 

 



62 _Section 5.8_ _Equity Compensation Matters_.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to ensure that the Warrant shall terminate as of the Effective Time and (ii)
after the Effective Time, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
bound by any Option, Warrant or other equity-based right that would entitle
any Person, other than the Parent or its Affiliates, to beneficially own,
or receive any payments in respect of, any capital stock of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall (i) take all actions to deliver
to Parent its calculation of Potential 280G Benefits, (ii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain waivers from "disqualified individuals" (as such
term is defined in the Treasury Regulations) where necessary and subject all
Potential 280G Benefits to Holder approval, and (iii) submit for Holder
approval, as described in Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and Treasury
Regulations Section1.280G-1 thereunder, all such Potential 280G Benefits.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all actions necessary to
ensure that the Parent shall assume the Option Plan effective as of the
Effective Time.

_Section 5.9_ _Employment Matters_.

 

(a) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with the Parent in its efforts to cause not less than 70% of the Companys
and its Subsidiaries employees to accept employment with the Parent or its
Subsidiaries and to execute and deliver an Offer Letter and CIA Agreement to
be effective upon consummation of the Transaction.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent, if and
to the extent requested by the Parent, to (i) allow the Parent and its
Representatives to conduct employee orientation sessions (with such sessions
to be held during scheduled work hours at times reasonably agreed to by the
Company and the Parent) and to meet with employees or independent contractors
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (either individually or in groups)
during breaks, outside of scheduled work hours or as otherwise agreed to by
the Company and the Parent, and (ii) provide information to employees
regarding Parents (or any of its Subsidiaries) employee benefit plans and
allow the Parent and its representatives to conduct an open enrollment period
to enable potential continuing employees to make benefit enrollment elections
under such employee benefit plans of the Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries)
that will be made available (if any) to continuing employees on and after the
Closing.

 

(c) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Parent shall (or shall
cause one or more of its Subsidiaries to) provide all individuals who are
employed by Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time who remain employed with Parent or any Subsidiary following the
Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ ") with employee benefits (other
than

 



63  equity-based awards) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to
those employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and
its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Any
individual (whether employed by the Company as of the date hereof or hired by
the Company after the date hereof but prior to the Closing Date) who is not
offered employment with Parent or one or more of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
an Employment Document or Offer Letter that provides (i) base compensation at
least equal to such individuals base compensation at the Company as of the
date hereof and (ii) base compensation and target cash incentive bonuses that
are no less favorable to such individual than those in place at the Company as
of the date hereof shall not be included in the denominator for purposes of
the thresholds set forth in _Section 5.9(a)_ or  _Section 7.3(j)_.

(d) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Parent shall (or shall
cause one or more of its Subsidiaries to) provide any Continuing Employees
with service credit (if applicable) with respect to all employee benefit plans
and programs (other than equity plans) maintained by Parent or its applicable
Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employees participate or become eligible
to participate for such Continuing Employees service with the Company for
purposes of eligibility, participation and vesting, to the extent permitted by
the applicable plan or program (except to the extent such service credit
would result in a duplication of benefits). With respect to any welfare
benefit plans provided under any Employee Plans maintained by Parent or its
applicable Subsidiaries for the benefit of the Continuing Employees on
and after the Closing Date, Parent shall (or shall cause its applicable
Subsidiaries to) use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) give effect, in
determining any deductible limitations, coinsurance or out-of-pocket maximums
applicable to a Continuing Employee, to any amounts previously credited for
such purposes under the applicable Employee Plans for the calendar year in
which the Closing Date occurs, with respect to similar plans maintained by the
Company and (ii) with respect to any health benefit plans maintained by
Parent or its applicable Subsidiaries (excluding any disability plans
maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries), ensure that no pre-existing
condition limitations or exclusion shall apply with respect to the Continuing
Employees (except to the extent any such limitation or exclusion applied prior
to the Closing under the applicable Employee Plan).

 

(e) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions
that may be reasonably requested by the Parent in writing prior to the
Closing Date with respect to (i) causing one or more Employee Plans,
International Employee Plans or arrangements with any payroll, benefits or
human resources service provider to the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate
or be amended as of the Closing Date or as of the day immediately preceding
the Closing Date (in each case as specified by the Parent), (ii) causing
benefit accrual or entitlement under any Employee Plan or International
Employee Plan to cease as of the Closing Date, (iii) causing the continuation
on and after the Closing Date of any insurance policy or arrangement relating
to any Employee Plan or International Employee Plan and (iv) facilitating the
merger of any Employee Plan or any International Employee Plan into any
employee benefit plan maintained by the Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries).

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.9_ or otherwise in this Agreement,
express or implied, shall (i) be construed to restrict in any way the ability
of the Parent, the

 



64  Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to (A) amend, terminate or
modify the duties, responsibilities or employment of any employee or
independent contractor, (B) to amend, terminate or modify any Employee Plan,
International Employee Plan, compensation or benefit arrangement or any other
employee benefit plans or programs maintained by the Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their Affiliates at any time or from time to time or (C) grant
any employee or independent contractor any special right for compensation,
(ii) be treated as an amendment or other modification of any compensation or
benefit arrangement of the Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Affiliates, including any Employee Plan or International Employee
Plan, or (iii) be construed to create any third-party beneficiary rights in
any present or former employee, service provider, independent
contractor, consultant, any such Persons alternate payees, dependents or
beneficiaries or any other Person, whether in respect of continued service or
resumed service, compensation, benefits or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, on and after the Closing, the employment
of employees by the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates (as applicable) shall be subject to the Parents usual terms,
conditions and policies of employment, including the Parents policies
regarding modifications of the terms and conditions of employment.

_Section 5.10_  _Confidentiality_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall hold, and shall cause its Representatives to hold, in confidence
all documents and information furnished to it by or on behalf of any other
party to this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby pursuant to the terms of the confidentiality agreement dated as of
December 18, 2012 and amended as of July 17, 2013 between the Parent and the
Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall continue in full
force and effect until the Closing Date. If for any reason this Agreement is
terminated prior to the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
nonetheless continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

_Section 5.11_ _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances_.

 

(a) Each of the parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all appropriate action to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party as promptly as
practicable, including to (i) obtain from Governmental Authorities and other
Persons all consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders as
are necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, (ii) promptly (and in no event later
than 10 days after the date of this Agreement) make all necessary filings, and
thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement
required under the HSR Act or under applicable Law and (iii) have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any order, decree, ruling, judgment, injunction
or other action (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in
effect and that enjoins, restrains, conditions, makes illegal or otherwise
restricts or prohibits the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, the Company shall permit the Parent reasonably
to participate in the defense and settlement of any claim, suit or cause of
action filed after the date of this Agreement relating to this Agreement, the

 



65  Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, and the Company shall
not settle or compromise any such claim, suit or cause of action without the
Parents written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), unless such settlement includes a release of
liability and payment of only money damages which are reflected in the
calculation of Estimated Cash.

 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to give promptly such notice to third parties and obtain
such third party consents and estoppel certificates as the Parent may in its
reasonable discretion deem necessary or desirable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. The
Parent shall cooperate with and assist the Company in giving such notices and
obtaining such consents and estoppel certificates; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Parent shall have no obligation to give any guarantee or other
consideration of any nature in connection with any such notice, consent or
estoppel certificate or consent to any change in the terms of any agreement or
arrangement that the Parent in its reasonable discretion may deem adverse to
the interests of the Parent or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parent shall not be
required by this  _Section 5.11_ to take or agree to undertake any action,
including entering into any consent decree, hold separate order or other
arrangement, that would (i) require the divestiture of any assets of the
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates or (ii) limit the
Parents freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to consolidate and
control, the Company and its Subsidiaries or any of their assets or businesses
or any of the Parents or its Affiliates other assets or businesses.

_Section 5.12_ _Termination of Indebtedness_. The Company shall
negotiate Debt Payoff Letters for all Funded Indebtedness. The Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver all notices and take all other
actions reasonably requested by the Parent to facilitate the termination of
all Contracts relating to Funded Indebtedness, the termination of the
commitments provided thereunder, the repayment in full of all obligations then
outstanding thereunder (using funds provided by the Parent) and the release of
all Encumbrances in connection therewith on the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall this _Section 5.12_ require the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to cause the termination of any Contracts relating to
Funded Indebtedness other than as part of the Closing.

_Section 5.13_ _Public Announcements_. The Company and the Parent shall
mutually agree on the form and timing of an initial joint press release to be
issued with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. In addition, the Company shall consult with and obtain the prior
approval of the Parent before issuing any press release or making any other
public disclosure with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public disclosure prior to such consultation and approval (except as may
be required by Law, in which event the Person proposing to issue such press
release or make such public disclosure shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to consult in good faith with the Parent before issuing any such press
release or making any such public disclosure). Nothing in this Agreement
shall prevent the Parent from making any public disclosure required by Law,
including disclosure requirements of the SEC or of any applicable securities
exchange.

 



66 _Section 5.14_ _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

(a) For a period of six years from and after the Closing Date, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation agree to indemnify and hold harmless, exculpate from
liability, and advance expenses to all present and former officers and
directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Indemnified
Parties_ ") to the same extent and on the same terms as such persons
are entitled to indemnification, exculpation or expense advancement by the
Company as of the date of this Agreement, whether pursuant to the Constituent
Documents, individual indemnification agreements, by Law or otherwise, for
acts or omissions or matters which occurred or arose at or prior to the
Effective Time (regardless of whether any proceeding relating to any Company
Indemnified Partys rights to indemnification, exculpation or expense
advancement with respect to any such matters, acts or omissions is commenced
before or after the Closing Date). Any claims for indemnification made under
this _Section 5.14(a)_ on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Closing
Date shall survive such anniversary until the final resolution thereof.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall purchase a six-year "tail"
coverage with respect to its current directors and officers liability policy
that will name the Surviving Corporation as beneficiary (the " _Tail Policy_
"). The Company shall prepay the full premium for the Tail Policy prior to the
Closing Date. Payment of any additional premiums or increases, together with
any other amounts that become due to maintain the Tail Policy in the form in
which it exists on the Closing Date, if any, shall be made directly by the
Securityholder Representative (solely on behalf of the Holders, Optionholders
and Warrantholder) after the Closing Date. The Surviving Corporation shall
promptly provide the Securityholder Representative with any notice it receives
regarding any obligation to pay any such additional premium or increase.
After the Closing Date, the Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
take any action to cause such Tail Policy to be canceled or terminated, except
as a result of non-payment of any premiums due.

 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 5.14_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, the Company Indemnified Parties (or their
heirs, personal representatives, successors or assigns). The Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its
successors to, pay all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) incurred by any Company Indemnified Party (or his or her heirs, personal
representatives, successors or assigns) in any legal action brought by such
person that is successful to enforce the obligations of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or its successors under this _Section 5.14_. The
obligations of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its successors under this
_Section 5.14_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party (or his or her
heirs, personal representatives, successors or assigns) without the prior
written consent of such Company Indemnified Party (or his or her heirs,
personal representatives, successors or assigns, as applicable).

 



67 _Section 5.15_ _Registration Statement_. As promptly as reasonably
practicable following the Effective Time, the Parent will file with the SEC
and have declared effective (and shall keep effective for six months from the
Effective Time) an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 as
provided in General Instruction I.D. to Form S-3 (the " _Resale Registration
Statement_ ") for the registration of the resale of the Registrable Shares.
The Resale Registration Statement shall include in the Plan of Distribution,
or other similar section, a description of the potential manner of resales of
the Registrable Shares as is requested by the holders of the Registrable
Shares and is not inconsistent with the requirements of Form S-3. Holders of
the Registrable Shares shall not use the Resale Registration Statement to
resell Registrable Shares except in accordance with the Resale Registration
Statement and subject to the following terms, conditions and restrictions:

 

(a) no holder of Registrable Shares shall resell more than one-sixth of such
holders Effective Time Shares during any of the first six consecutive one-
month periods following the date on which the Resale Registration Statement
becomes effective;

(b) the Parent shall have the right to suspend, and the holders of
Registrable Shares shall suspend, the use of the Resale Registration Statement
for resales of Registrable Shares upon prior written notice from Parent to the
Securityholder Representative, for a reasonable period of time not to exceed
15 consecutive days if the chief executive officer or chief financial officer
of the Parent determines in his or her good faith judgment that it would be
materially detrimental to the Parent or its securityholders not to suspend
the use by the holders of Registrable Shares of the Resale Registration
Statement by reason of: (i) the Parent being in possession of material non-
public information, so long as the chief executive officer or chief financial
officer of the Company determines in good faith that the disclosure of such
information during the period specified in such notice would be required to be
disclosed and that such disclosure would be detrimental to the Parent or its
securityholders; and (ii) a contemplated financing, acquisition, disposition,
corporate reorganization, merger, or other similar transaction or other
material event or circumstance affecting the Parent or its securities;

 

(c) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate resales
of Registrable Shares by the holders of the Registrable Shares pursuant to
the Resale Registration Statement and this _Section 5.15_, including by way
of removing the restrictive legends set forth on such Registrable Shares; and

 

(d) notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each holder of
Registrable Shares may (but shall not be obligated to) enter into
hedging arrangements with respect to the Registrable Shares, in each case in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth on _Schedule 5.15(d)_ of
the Disclosure Schedules.

 

 _Section 5.16_ _Registrable Shares Indemnification_.

 

(a) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless each holder of Registrable
Shares, such holders directors and officers and partners and members, each
broker or dealer who participates in the offering of such Registrable Shares,
each agent of such a holder

 



68  (including legal counsel and accountants) and each Person, if any, who
controls (within the meaning of the Securities Act) such holder (collectively,
the " _Holder Indemnified Parties_ "), against any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, joint or several, to which they may become subject under
applicable federal and state securities Laws or otherwise, insofar as such
losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or proceedings in respect thereof)
arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of
any material fact contained in the Resale Registration Statement (including
any amendments or supplements thereto); (ii) the omission or alleged omission
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading; or (iii) any violation or alleged
violation by the indemnifying party of applicable federal and state
securities Laws, and shall reimburse each such Holder Indemnified Party for
any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with
investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage or liability as such
expenses are incurred; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligations in this
_Section 5.16(a)_ shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such
loss, claim, damage or liability if such settlement is effected without the
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent shall not be
liable to any Holder Indemnified Party in any such case for any such loss,
claim, damage or liability to the extent that it arises out of or is based
upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission made in connection with the Resale Registration Statement or
amendments or supplements thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such
registration by any such holder of Registrable Shares. The obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.16(a)_ shall remain in full force and
effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any such
Holder Indemnified Party and shall survive the transfer of such Registrable
Shares by any holder of Registrable Shares and the termination of this
Agreement.

 

(b) Each holder of Registrable Shares severally and not jointly shall
indemnify and hold harmless Parent, each of its directors and officers, each
person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of the Securities Act) Parent
and each agent of Parent (including legal counsel and accountants)
(collectively, the " _Issuer Indemnified Parties_ ") against any losses,
claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they may become
subject, under applicable federal and state securities Laws or otherwise,
insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or proceedings in
respect thereof) arise solely out of or are based solely upon (i) any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the
Resale Registration Statement (including any amendments or supplements
thereto), (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the
indemnifying party of applicable federal and state securities Laws, in each
case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission or violation or
alleged violation was made in the Resale Registration Statement or amendments
or supplements thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished by or on behalf of such Holder expressly for use in
connection with such registration; and each such Holder shall reimburse any
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by an Issuer Indemnified Party
with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage or liability as
such expenses are incurred; _provided_ ,

 



69   _however_ , that the obligations in this _Section 5.16(b)_ shall not apply
to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage or liability if
such settlement is effected without the consent of such holder of Registrable
Shares (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); _provided_ , _further_ , that the liability of each holder of
Registrable Shares under this  _Section 5.16(b)_ and _Section 5.16(d)_
shall be limited to the proceeds received by such holder of Registrable Shares
from the sale of Registrable Shares covered by the Resale Registration
Statement. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of
any investigation made by or on behalf of any such Issuer Indemnified Party,
and shall survive the transfer of such Registrable Shares by any holder of
Registrable Shares and the termination of this Agreement. 

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this _Section 5.16_
of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if
a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under
this _Section 5.16_, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the
commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to
participate in and assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
indemnifying party and reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that an indemnified party shall have the right to
retain its own counsel, with all fees and expenses thereof to be paid by such
indemnified party, and to be apprised of all progress in any proceeding the
defense of which has been assumed by the indemnifying party. The failure to
notify an indemnifying party promptly of the commencement of any such action,
if and to the extent prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall
relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party
under this _Section 5.16_, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying
party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified
party otherwise than under this _Section 5.16_.

 

(d) Except as otherwise limited by _Section 5.16(b)_, to the extent any
indemnification by an indemnifying party is prohibited or limited by
applicable Law, the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such
indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the actions which
resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying
party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such
indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
action. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses,
claims, damages or liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include
any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in
connection with any investigation or proceeding. The parties hereto agree
that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this
_Section 5.16(d)_ were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other
method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to in this _Section 5.16(d)_. No Person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent

 



70  misrepresentation. The liability of each holder of Registrable Shares
hereunder by way of contribution under this _Section 5.16(d)_ and
indemnification under _Section 5.16(b)_ shall be limited to the proceeds
received by such holder of Registrable Shares from the sale of Registrable
Shares covered by the Resale Registration Statement.

applicable, must be made hereunder prior to the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, in which case such claim shall survive until it has been
finally resolved.

 



75 _Section 8.2_ _Indemnification by the Holders, Optionholders and
Warrantholder_. The Holders, Optionholders and Warrantholder (the " _Company
Indemnifying Parties_ "), severally but not jointly (according to their
respective Pro Rata Percentages), shall save, defend, indemnify and hold
harmless the Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and their
Affiliates, and the respective Representatives, successors and assigns of each
of the foregoing from and against any and all losses, damages, interest,
awards, judgments, penalties, costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees, costs and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
investigating, preparing or defending the foregoing to the extent such fees,
costs and expenses are incurred in connection with an indemnifiable
Loss) (hereinafter collectively, " _Losses_ "), incurred, sustained or
suffered by any of the foregoing as a result of or arising out of:

 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company contained
in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule or the certificate delivered
pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 7.3(a)_;

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement by Company contained in this
Agreement;

(c) any amounts paid to the holders of Dissenting Shares, including any

the terms and conditions set forth in such _Schedule 8.2(d)_ ).

 

 _Section 8.3_ _Indemnification by the Parent_. The Parent shall save,
defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Holders and their Affiliates and the
respective Representatives, successors and assigns of each of the foregoing
from and against any and all Losses incurred, sustained or suffered by any of

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Parent or Merger
Sub contained in this Agreement, any disclosure schedule to  _Article IV_ or
the certificate delivered pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 7.2(a)_;
and

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement by the Parent or Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement.

_Section 8.4_ _Procedures_.

 

(a) In order for a party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out
of or involving a Loss or a claim or demand made by any person against the
Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall
deliver notice thereof to the Securityholder Representative, on behalf of the
Holders, Optionholders and Warrantholder, or to the Parent, as applicable (the

 



76  " _Indemnifying Party_ ") with reasonable promptness after receipt by such
Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party Claim and shall provide
the Indemnifying Party with such information with respect thereto as the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to provide such notice,
however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations
under this _Article VIII_ except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced by such failure.

(b) If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party against any and all Losses that may result
from a Third Party Claim that is exclusively for civil monetary damages at law
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party within 15 days of
receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of such Third
Party Claim, to assume the defense thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim for equitable or injunctive relief or any claim that would impose
criminal liability or damages, and the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to defend any such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not
expressly elect to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within the
time period and otherwise in accordance with the first sentence of this
_Section 8.4(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall have the sole right to assume
the defense of and to settle such Third Party Claim and, in any such case,
shall (x) keep the Securityholder Representative informed of all material
developments relating to such Third Party Claim and (y) promptly provide to
the Securityholder Representative copies of all pleadings, notices and
communications with respect to such Third Party Claim to the extent that
receipt of such documents does not waive any privilege. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that the defense of
any Third Party Claim is conducted by the Indemnified Party in accordance
with this _Section 8.4(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise of such Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Securityholder
Representative (it being understood and agreed that the Securityholder
Representative may withhold consent to any requested settlement if the
Securityholder Representative believes in good faith that there is not any
underlying basis for indemnification under _Section 8.2_ with respect to
such settlement and absent such consent, the mere existence of such Third
Party Claim shall not be deemed indicative of the existence or amount of
indemnifiable Losses relating to such Third Party Claim). If the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the
defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of the Indemnified Party unless (i) the employment of such counsel
shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party
or (ii) the named parties to the Third Party Claim (including any impleaded
parties) include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and
the Indemnified Party reasonably determines that representation by counsel to
the Indemnifying Party of both the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified
Party may present such counsel with a conflict of interest. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, cooperate with
the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying
Party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and

 



77  information in the Indemnified Partys possession or under the Indemnified
Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying
Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim if such
settlement, compromise or judgment (A) involves a finding or admission of
wrongdoing, (B) does not include an unconditional written release by the
claimant or plaintiff of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect
of such Third Party Claim or (C) imposes equitable remedies or any obligation
on the Indemnified Party other than solely the payment of money damages for
which the Indemnified Party will be fully indemnified hereunder.

 

(c) Subject to the limitations set forth herein, the indemnification required
hereunder in respect of a Third Party Claim shall be made by prompt payment
by the Escrow Agent (to the extent of any amounts then held in the Escrow Fund
if applicable) or the Indemnifying Party (to the extent of any amounts not
then held in the Escrow Fund if applicable) of the amount of actual Losses
in connection therewith only to the extent such Losses have been determined
to be indemnifiable Losses hereunder pursuant to the terms hereof, including
that any dispute regarding such characterization has been resolved according
to  _Section 10.10_.

(d) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to require that any action be
made or brought against any other Person before action is brought or claim is
made against it hereunder by the Indemnified Party.

(e) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim being
asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim with reasonable
promptness to the Indemnifying Party. The failure to provide such notice,
however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations
under this _Article VIII_ except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
is materially prejudiced by such failure and shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any other obligation or liability that it may have to
the Indemnified Party or otherwise than pursuant to this _Article VIII_. If
the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within 30 days
following its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its
liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder, such claim specified by the
Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of
the Indemnifying Party hereunder and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the
amount of such liability to the Indemnified Party on demand. If the
Indemnifying Party agrees that it has an indemnification obligation
but asserts that it is obligated to pay a lesser amount than that claimed by
the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall pay such lesser amount
promptly to the Indemnified Party, without prejudice to or waiver of the
Indemnified Partys claim for the difference.

_Section 8.5_ _Limits on Indemnification_.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: (i)
an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification

 



78  pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of
indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from the Indemnifying Party equals
or exceeds $2,025,000, in which case an Indemnifying Party shall be liable
only for the Losses in excess of such amount; _provided_ , that no Losses may
be claimed by any Indemnified Party or may be included in calculating the
aggregate Losses for the purpose of this _clause (i)_ other than Losses in
excess of $50,000, (ii) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses
which may be recovered from a Company Indemnifying Party arising out of or
relating to the matters set forth in  _Section 2.13_ and _Section 8.2_
shall be the Escrow Amount (which shall constitute the sole and exclusive
remedy for such matters), and (iii) the Holders, Optionholders and
Warrantholder shall not be obligated to indemnify the Parent or any other
Person with respect to any Loss to the extent that a specific accrual or
reserve for the amount of such Loss was taken into account in calculating the
Net Adjustment Amount; _provided_ , _further_ that the foregoing  _clauses
(i)_ and _(ii)_ shall not apply to Losses arising out of or relating to the
breach of any Fundamental Representation or claims based on Fraudulent breach
of any representation or warranty described in  _Section 8.2_, for which in
the case of liability of any Holder, Optionholder or Warrantholder the maximum
liability shall be the portion of the Gross Cash Merger Consideration and
Closing Stock Merger Consideration (valuing shares of Parent Common Stock
using the Average Stock Price) actually paid to such Person. No Indemnified
Party may make a claim after the first anniversary of the Closing Date for
indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)_ or  _Section 8.3(a)_, as the case
may be, for breach by the Indemnifying Party of a particular representation or
warranty, except with respect to a claim based on a Fundamental Representation
or Fraudulent breach of any representation or warranty described in _Section
8.2_ or _Section 8.3_, for which no Indemnified Party may make a claim after
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

 

(c) Following the Closing and except as provided in _Section 2.13_, (i)
_Article VIII_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for recovery of
Losses by the Indemnified Parties entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 8.2_ (each, a " _Parent Indemnified Party_ ") for all indemnifiable
matters or other breaches under this Agreement (which means, for example,
that the survival periods and liability limits set forth in this Article VIII
shall control notwithstanding any statutory or common law provisions or
principles to the contrary), (ii) all applicable statutes of limitations or
other claims periods with respect to claims for Losses shall be shortened to
the applicable claims periods and survival periods set forth herein, and (iii)
the Parent Indemnified Parties irrevocably waive any and all rights they may
have to make claims against any Indemnifying Party under statutory and common
Law as a result of any Losses and any and all other damages incurred by the
Parent Indemnified Parties with respect to this Agreement whether or not in
excess of the maximum amounts permitted to be recovered pursuant to this
_Article VIII_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for purposes of
calculating or determining the amount of Losses indemnifiable under _Section
8.2_: (i) there shall be deducted from any Losses an amount equal to the
amount of any proceeds actually received by any Parent Indemnified Party from
any third-party insurer or from any other third parties in connection with
such Losses (net of any increased premiums as a result of paying such
insurance claims); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any Parent
Indemnified Party first recovers from the Escrow Amount or an Indemnifying
Party for any Losses and

 



79  thereafter recovers for the same Losses from any third-party insurer or from
any other third parties in connection with such Losses, then the amount
recovered from such third party (up to the amount first recovered from the
Escrow Amount or the Indemnifying Party) shall be deposited in the Escrow Fund
or paid to the applicable Indemnifying Party, as applicable, by Parent;
_provided_ , _further_ , that no Parent Indemnified Party shall have any
obligation to use more than commercially reasonable efforts to claim, seek or
otherwise obtain any such insurance, indemnity, contribution or reimbursement
proceeds to which it may be entitled and in no event shall be required
to commence any Action to claim, seek or otherwise obtain such proceeds; (ii)
no Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to double recovery for any
adjustments to consideration provided for hereunder or for any indemnifiable
Losses even though such Losses, or any other adjustment, may have resulted
from the breach of more than one of the representations, warranties and
covenants, or any other indemnity, in this Agreement; (iii) if and solely to
the extent that an amount of Losses in connection with an indemnifiable
matter was already taken into account in connection with calculation of the
Closing Cash, Closing Non-Cash Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness,
Closing Transaction Expenses, the same amount of such Losses may not be
recovered under this _Article VIII_ ; and (iv) costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees, costs and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
investigating, preparing or defending any applicable Third Party Claim) shall
constitute indemnifiable Losses if and solely to the extent that such Third
Party Claim gives rise to indemnifiable Losses.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Losses shall include
only actual losses and out-of-pocket expenses incurred, and shall not include
any other Losses, such as (i) punitive or special damages of any kind (except
to the extent that such damages are actually awarded to a third party in
connection with a Third Party Claim), (ii) incidental or consequential damages
of any kind (except to the extent that such damages are actually awarded to a
third party in connection with a Third Party Claim or were otherwise
reasonably foreseeable under an objective standard), or (iii) reductions or
diminutions in value, lost opportunities or other speculative damages.

 

(f) In determining whether there has been a breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant, and, if applicable, the amount of any Losses in respect
of such breach, any materiality or Material Adverse Effect standard or
qualification contained in such representation or warranty shall be
disregarded (other than in instances where the context dictates otherwise
(e.g., the operation of this sentence shall not turn references to "Material
Contract" to "Contract")).

(g) Any claim for indemnification under _Section 8.2_, and any offer to
compromise or settle such claim, must be made on a pro rata basis to all
Company Indemnifying Parties (based on their respective Pro Rata Percentages).

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company is not
guaranteeing and no Holder, Optionholder, or Warrantholder shall be held
liable for Parents use of, or inability to use, net operating losses, capital
losses, built-in losses, tax credits or similar items of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

 



80 _Section 8.6_ _Remedies Not Affected by Investigation, Disclosure or
Knowledge_. If the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the
Parent expressly reserves the right to seek indemnity or other remedy for any
Losses arising out of or relating to any breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained herein, notwithstanding any investigation by,
disclosure to or knowledge of the Parent in respect of any fact or
circumstances that reveals the occurrence of any such breach, whether before
or after the execution and delivery hereof.

 

 _Section 8.7_ _Escrow Fund_.

 

(a) The Parent hereby agrees that it shall seek a remedy from the Escrow Fund,
to the extent of the amount then held in the Escrow Fund, with respect to any
indemnification claim asserted hereunder before seeking to recover any Losses
directly from the Holders, Optionholders or Warrantholder.

 

(b) Upon the termination of the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall pay any amounts remaining in the
Escrow Fund to the Holders (other than holders of any Dissenting Shares),
Optionholders and Warrantholder as instructed by the Securityholder
Representative. Payment of such amounts to Holders, Optionholders and
Warrantholder shall be made pro rata in accordance with their respective Pro
Rata Percentages.

_Section 8.8_ _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnity payment under
this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration
for Tax purposes to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

(d) by either the Company or the Parent in the event that any Governmental
Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other
