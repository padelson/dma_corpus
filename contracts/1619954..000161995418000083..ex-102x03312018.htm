Status of the Parties. In the performance by Consultant of the Work described
in this Agreement, it is agreed that Consultant is at all times acting and
performing as an independent contractor. Other than as specifically set forth
herein, the Company will neither have nor exercise any control or direction
over the manner and method by which Consultant provides the Work. Consultant
will determine the time and occasions to be devoted to accomplishing the Work,
subject only to Consultant providing the services needed in a timely manner
and to Consultant making itself, as applicable, reasonably available to meet
with the Company management as mutually agreed. Consultant will not be deemed
an employee of the Company for any purpose whatsoever, and will not be
eligible to participate in any benefit program provided by the Company for its
employees, except as otherwise specifically provided herein. Other than as
otherwise set forth herein, the Company will have no responsibility for the
payment to or on behalf of Consultant of any wages and salaries, taxes,
withholding payments, penalties, fees, fringe benefits, professional liability
insurance premiums, contributions to insurance and pension or other deferred
compensation plans (including but not limited to, workers' compensation and
Social Security obligations, and licensing and certification fees and
expenses), nor will the Company have any responsibility for the filing of any
and all documents, forms and returns pertinent to all of the foregoing.
Consultant agrees to pay any and all taxes, withholding payments, penalties,
fees, Social Security obligations and similar obligations and agrees to hold Page 3 of 7





the Company harmless against any claims against the Company relating to
Consultant's obligations thereunder. The Company will not be responsible for
Consultant's indirect expenses or other costs of doing business.

| 
---|--- 

a.

|

In the event the Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental agency
should question or challenge the independent contractor status of Consultant,
the parties hereby agree that the Company will have the right to participate
in any discussions or negotiation occurring with such agency or agencies,
regardless of with whom or by whom such discussions or negotiations are
initiated. 

| 
---|--- 

b.

|

It is expressly agreed that Consultant will have no right or authority at any
time to make any contract or binding promise of any nature on behalf of the
Company, whether oral or written, without the prior express written consent of
the Company in each such instance. 

| 
---|--- 

5.

|

Confidentiality. 

| 
---|--- 

a.

|

"Confidential Information" means any and all: (i) trade secrets concerning the
business and affairs of the Company or its clients (previous, current, or
those actively being pursued), product and services specifications, data,
know-how, formulae, compositions, processes, designs, sketches, photographs,
graphs, drawings, samples, inventions and ideas, past, current, and planned
research and development, current and planned product development or
distribution methods and processes, client lists, current and anticipated
client requirements, price lists and methodologies, market studies, business
plans, computer software and programs (including object code and source code),
computer software and database technologies, systems, structures, and
architectures (and related formulae, compositions, processes, improvements,
devices, know-how, inventions, discoveries, concepts, ideas, designs, methods
and information), however documented, that is a trade secret within the
meaning of applicable state trade secret law; (ii) information collected by
the Company in the performance of its services on behalf of its clients
(previous, current, or those actively being pursued), which may include
certain medical and patient related information and any other information
protected by law; (iii) information concerning the business and affairs of the
Company (which includes historical financial statements, financial projections
and budgets, historical and projected sales, capital spending budgets and
plans, the names and backgrounds of key personnel, personnel training and
techniques and materials), however documented; and (iv) notes, analysis,
compilations, studies, summaries, and other material prepared by or for the
Company containing or based, in whole or in part, on any information included
in the foregoing. "Confidential Information" does not include that information
defined as Confidential Information above that: (a) has been made public
voluntarily by the party to whom such information belongs; or (b) has
otherwise become publicly available without violation of any obligation of
confidentiality or other obligation to the party to whom such information
belongs or under law. 

| 
---|--- 

b.

|

Consultant acknowledges and agrees that disclosure of the Confidential
Information would severely affect Company or its Affiliates and provide the
recipient of the Confidential Information with a substantial and unfair
competitive advantage. Page 4 of 7





Consultant covenants and agrees, that as a Consultant at the Company,
Consultant has entered into a relationship of confidence and trust with the
Company, with respect to any Confidential Information which Consultant may
acquire, have access to or develop in connection with, or as a result of, the
consulting activities, or which the Company provides to Consultant in
connection with such activities, including information which the Company is
obligated to others to keep in confidence. During the term of this Agreement
and following the termination of this Agreement, Consultant will keep all
Confidential Information in confidence, and will not, without the Company's
prior written consent, either disclose Confidential Information to others or
use Confidential Information, except as necessary in the ordinary course of
Consultant's duties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or SOWs. Before
providing any Confidential Information to any consultant or employee,
Consultant will ensure that a nondisclosure agreement or an agreement
containing terms substantially similar to those contained in this Section 5 is
in place with each consultant or employee that is substantially similar to
this Agreement and will provide a copy of such agreement to the Company.
Before providing the Confidential Information, each employee or consultant to
whom such disclosure is to be made will be notified that such Confidential
Information is received in confidence and will be kept in confidence by such
employee or consultant as set forth in this Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

c.

|

Equitable Relief. A violation of any of the covenants or restrictions in this
Section 5 will result in irreparable harm to the Company and an award of
monetary damages, alone, would be an inadequate remedy. Consequently, if
Consultant violates or threatens to violate any of the above covenants, the
Company, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided under law, will
be entitled to both (i) a preliminary or permanent injunction in order to
prevent the continuation of such harm and (ii) money damages, insofar as they
can be reasonably determined, including, without limitation, all reasonable
costs and attorneys' fees incurred by the Company in enforcing this Agreement.
Furthermore, Consultant's violation of any of the above covenants while
engaged by the Company may result in the immediate termination of this
Agreement. This terms of this Section 5 will survive expiration or termination
of this Agreement.

for it) created, conceived, or developed by Consultant for the Company, either

rights pertaining thereto. In the event that any such works are not works made

to any Consultant Works in the United States and any foreign jurisdictions;

(v) give testimony and render any other assistance but without expense to
Consultant in support of the Company's rights to any Consultant Works.
Consultant retains no rights in the Consultant Works and agrees not to
challenge the Company's ownership of the rights embodied in the Consultant
Works. Consultant further agrees to assist the Company in every proper way to
enforce the Company's rights relating to the Consultant Works in any and all
countries, including, but not limited to, executing, verifying and delivering
such documents and performing such other acts (including appearing as a
witness) as the Company may reasonably request for use in obtaining,
perfecting, evidencing, sustaining and enforcing the Company's rights relating
to the Consultant Works. In the event that Consultant does not, for any
reason, execute such documents within a reasonable time of Client's request,
Consultant hereby irrevocably appoints the Company as Consultant's attorney-
in-fact for the purpose of executing such documents on Consultant's behalf,
which appointment is coupled with an interest. Consultant will not attempt to
register any works created by Consultant pursuant to this Agreement at the
U.S. Copyright Office, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or any foreign
copyright, patent, or trademark registry.

If Consultant has any rights, including without limitation "artist's rights"
or "moral rights," in the Consultant Works which cannot be assigned (the "Non-
Assignable Rights"), Consultant agrees to waive enforcement worldwide of such

that cannot be assigned or waived Consultant hereby grants to the Company a
