use or development of the other Conveyed Interests (as owned, operated, used,
or developed by Seller or its Affiliates immediately prior to the Effective
Time) and/or (ii) the Assumed Obligations; provided, that, for the avoidance
of doubt, the items described in the definition of "Excluded Assets and Other
Matters" will be deemed excluded from any real property, personal property or
contract right that would otherwise be covered by, through or under this
Section 2.1(o).

For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that the term "Subject
Properties," as used in this Agreement, means the 100% interest on an 8/8ths
basis in and to the Leases, the Wells, the Units, the Hydrocarbons and
minerals described in Section 2.1(c), the Other Wells and the personal
property, fixtures and buildings described in Section 2.1(d) or Section

2.2 Excluded Assets and Other Matters. Seller shall reserve and retain all of
the Excluded Assets and Other Matters.

2.3 Revenues and Expenses.

(a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement (including
Sections 2.3(b) and 3.3), Seller shall remain entitled to all of the rights of
ownership (including the right to all production, proceeds of production, and
other proceeds) and shall remain responsible (by payment, through the
adjustments to the Purchase Price under this Agreement or otherwise) for all
Operating Expenses, in each case attributable to the Conveyed Interests for
the period of time prior to the Effective Time. Except as expressly provided
otherwise in this Agreement (including Section 3.3), and subject to the
occurrence of Closing, Buyer shall be entitled to all of the rights of
ownership (including the right to all production, proceeds of production, and
other proceeds) attributable to the Conveyed Interests for the period of time
commencing at the Effective Time, and shall be responsible for (by payment,
through the adjustments to the Purchase Price under this 

Agreement or otherwise) all Operating Expenses attributable to the Conveyed
Interests for the period of time commencing at the Effective Time (including
any pre-payments made before the Effective Time for services, work or goods
performed or to be performed, or delivered or to be delivered after the
Effective Time). Such amounts which are received or paid prior to Closing
shall be accounted for in the Preliminary Settlement Statement or Final
Settlement Statement, as applicable; provided, however, that the Preliminary
Settlement Statement may contain estimated amounts of Seller made in good
faith. Such amounts which are received or paid after Closing but prior to the
date of the Final Settlement Statement shall be accounted for in the Final
Settlement Statement.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.3(b), after the Parties'
agreement upon the Final Settlement Statement, if, based on the Effective Time
allocation described in Section 2.3(a) (except to the extent constituting part
of the Assumed Obligations), (i) either Party receives monies belonging to the
other Party, including proceeds of production, then such amount shall, within
30 days after the end of the calendar month in which such amounts were
received, be paid over to the proper Party, (ii) either Party pays monies for
Operating Expenses which are the obligation of the other Party, then such
other Party shall, within 30 days after the end of the calendar month in which
the applicable invoice and proof of payment of such invoice were received,
reimburse the Party which paid such Operating Expenses, (iii) a Party receives
an invoice of an expense or obligation (other than an invoice of an expense or
obligation with respect to Asset Taxes, Income Taxes or Transfer Taxes) which
is owed by the other Party, such Party receiving the invoice shall promptly
forward such invoice to the Party obligated to pay the same, and (iv) an
invoice or other evidence of an obligation (other than an obligation with
respect to Asset Taxes, Income Taxes or Transfer Taxes) is received by a
Party, which is partially an obligation of both Seller and Buyer, then the
Parties shall consult with each other, and each shall promptly pay its portion
of such obligation to the obligee thereof. Subject to, and without prejudice
to, Buyer's rights and remedies under Section 13.2(c) with respect to
Operating Expenses that constitute Specified Obligations, the Final Settlement
Statement shall be the final accounting for any and all Operating Expenses,
and there shall be no adjustment for, or obligation to pay, any Operating
Expenses between the Parties following the Final Settlement Statement.

(c) Each of Seller and Buyer shall be permitted to offset any Operating
Expenses owed by such Party to the other Party pursuant to this Section 2.3
against amounts owing by the second Party to the first Party pursuant to this
Section 2.3.

3.1 Purchase Price. The purchase price for the transfer of the Conveyed
Interests and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be $205,000,000 (the
"Purchase Price"), as adjusted pursuant to this Agreement, payable by Buyer
(less (a) the Deposit, which will be distributed at Closing as described in
Section 3.2 and (b) the Defect Escrow Amount, if applicable, which will be
paid into the Escrow Account pursuant to Section 3.6(c) and distributed

(such amount, including any interest earned thereon, the "Deposit") to be held
in, and distributed from, the Escrow Account pursuant to the Escrow Agreement
and this Agreement. If Closing occurs, the Deposit shall be applied toward the
Adjusted Purchase Price at Closing and the Parties shall instruct the Escrow

3.3 Adjustment to Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted as
follows (without duplication), and the resulting amount shall be herein called
the "Adjusted Purchase Price":

(a) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the following amounts:

(i) an amount equal to the value of all Hydrocarbons (other than Tank Bottoms)
attributable to the Conveyed Interests that are, as of the Effective Time, in
storage or existing in stock tanks, pipelines and/or plants (including
inventory and line fill), the value to be based upon the price paid to Seller

made before the Effective Time for services, work or goods performed or to be
performed, or delivered or to be delivered after the Effective Time),
including (A) Burdens, (B) bond and insurance premiums paid by or on behalf of
Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to the period of time commencing

Well Imbalances attributable to the Conveyed Interests, an amount equal to the
product of the underproduced gaseous Hydrocarbon volumes set forth on Schedule
7.10 times $2.34/MMBtu;

(v) subject to Section 3.9, to the extent that Seller has over-delivered any
Hydrocarbons as of the Effective Time, as complete and final settlement of all

(vi) the Overhead Costs;

(vii) to the extent Seller has not received or otherwise been reimbursed prior
to Closing, the aggregate amount of accounts receivable billed after the
Effective Time with respect to the total amount of costs and expenses paid by
Seller on behalf of or that are properly chargeable to any Third Party with
respect to any Subject Property for periods of time after the Effective Time,
which adjustment shall not be made at Closing but shall be made in connection
with the Final Settlement Statement and taken into account in the Final Price;
and

(viii) any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise
agreed upon in writing by Seller and Buyer as an upward adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

(b) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the following amounts:

(i) an amount equal to all proceeds actually received by Seller or its
Affiliates attributable to the sale of Hydrocarbons (A) produced from or
allocable to the Conveyed Interests during the period of time commencing at
the Effective Time or (B) contained in storage or existing in stock tanks,
pipelines and/or plants (including inventory and line fill) as of the
Effective Time for which an upward Purchase Price adjustment was made pursuant
to Section 3.3(a)(i), in each case, net of marketing expenses (other than
Operating Expenses and other expenses taken into account pursuant to Section
3.3(a), Income Taxes, Asset Taxes and Transfer Taxes) directly incurred in
earning or receiving such proceeds and that are paid by Seller (and not
reimbursed to Seller by a Third Party purchaser);

(ii) an amount equal to all Operating Expenses and all other costs and
expenses paid after the Effective Time by Buyer or any of its Affiliates that

Taxes, Income Taxes and Transfer Taxes) for the period prior to the Effective
Time, including (A) Burdens, (B) bond and insurance premiums paid by or on
behalf of Buyer or any of its Affiliates with respect to the period of time
prior to the Effective Time, and (C) rentals and other lease maintenance
payments;

(iii) the amount of all Asset Taxes allocated to Seller in accordance with
Section 15.2 but that have been paid or are payable by Buyer as of the date

transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to Sections 4.1(b), 5.5(a)(i),
5.5(b)(i) or 6.1(c);

(vii) subject to Section 3.9, to the extent that Seller has overproduced any

7.10 times $2.34/MMBtu;

(viii) subject to Section 3.9, to the extent that Seller has under-delivered
any Hydrocarbons as of the Effective Time, as complete and final settlement of
all Pipeline Imbalances attributable to the Conveyed Interests, an amount
equal to the product of the under-delivered gaseous Hydrocarbon volumes set
forth on Schedule 7.10 times $2.34/MMBtu;

(ix) an amount equal to all proceeds from sales of Hydrocarbons relating to
the Conveyed Interests and payable to owners of working interests, Burdens or
other similar interests (in each case) that are held by Seller or its
Affiliates in suspense as of the Closing Date (or a date after Closing when
the liability to such suspense accounts are transferred from Seller to Buyer),
which adjustment shall not be made at Closing but shall be made in connection
with the Final Settlement Statement and taken into account in the Final Price;
and

(x) any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise
agreed upon in writing by Seller and Buyer as a downward adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

3.4 Adjustment Methodology. When available, actual figures will be used for
the adjustments to the Purchase Price at Closing. To the extent actual figures
are not available, estimates made by the relevant Party in good faith will be
used subject to final adjustments in accordance with Section 3.6 and Section
3.7. Seller will provide supporting documents and calculations, as applicable,
for Purchase Price adjustments included in the Preliminary Settlement
Statement and/or the Final Settlement Statement. In the event the written
report delivered by Buyer to Seller pursuant to Section 3.5 or a Dispute
Notice, if applicable, proposes an adjustment to the Purchase Price under
Section 3.3(b)(ii), Buyer will provide supporting documents (if any) for such
proposed adjustment when it delivers such written report or Dispute Notice to
Seller.

3.5 Preliminary Settlement Statement. Not less than five Business Days prior
to Closing, Seller shall prepare and submit to Buyer for review a draft
settlement statement (the "Preliminary Settlement Statement") that shall set
forth the Adjusted Purchase Price, reflecting each adjustment made in
accordance with this Agreement as of the date of preparation of such
Preliminary Settlement Statement and the calculation of the adjustments used
to determine such amount (in each case, without duplication of any amounts),
together with the designation of Seller's accounts for the wire transfer of
funds as set forth in Section 3.1 and Section 12.3(d). Within three Business
Days after receipt of the Preliminary Settlement Statement, Buyer will deliver
to Seller a written report containing all changes, with explanation therefor,
that Buyer proposes to be made to the Preliminary Settlement Statement, if
any. The Parties shall in good faith attempt to agree on the Preliminary
Settlement Statement as soon as possible after Seller's receipt of Buyer's
written report. The Preliminary Settlement Statement, as agreed upon by the
Parties, will be used to adjust 

the Purchase Price at Closing (the Purchase Price, as adjusted at Closing and
(a) less the Deposit and (b) downward adjusted by, among other things, any
amounts deposited into escrow pursuant to Section 3.6(c), the "Closing
Payment"); provided that if the Parties do not agree on an adjustment set
forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement prior to the Closing, the amount
of such adjustment set forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement as
presented by Seller in good faith will be used to adjust the Purchase Price at
Closing.

3.6 Final Settlement Statement.

(a) On or before 120 days after the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a
final settlement statement (the "Final Settlement Statement") prepared by
Seller based on actual income and expenses during the Interim Period and which
(i) takes into account all final adjustments made to the Purchase Price and
(ii) shows the resulting final Adjusted Purchase Price (in each case, without
duplication of any amounts) (the "Final Price"). The Final Settlement
Statement shall set forth the actual proration of the amounts required by this
Agreement. As soon as practicable, and in any event within 30 days after
receipt of the Final Settlement Statement, Buyer will deliver to Seller a
written report containing any proposed changes to the Final Settlement
Statement and an explanation of any such changes and the reasons therefor (the
"Dispute Notice"). Any changes not so specified in the Dispute Notice shall be
deemed waived and Seller's determinations with respect to all such elements of
the Final Settlement Statement that are not addressed specifically in the
Dispute Notice shall prevail. If Buyer fails to timely deliver a Dispute
Notice to Seller containing changes Buyer proposes to be made to the Final
Settlement Statement, the Final Settlement Statement as delivered by Seller
will be deemed to be correct and mutually agreed upon by the Parties, and will
be final and binding on the Parties and not subject to further audit or
arbitration.

(b) At such time that the Final Price set forth in the Final Settlement
Statement is mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer (or deemed to be
mutually agreed upon by the Parties pursuant to Section 3.6(a)), or, if the
Final Settlement Statement is not mutually agreed upon (or deemed to be
mutually agreed upon) by the Parties, at such time that the matters subject to
any Dispute Notices, if applicable, are resolved pursuant to Section 3.7, the
Final Settlement Statement and the Final Price shall be final and binding on
the Parties, subject to the provisions of Section 2.3(b). If the Final Price
is more than the Buyer Amount P-A-C (such difference, the "Payable Amount"),
then (i) the Defect Escrow Amount shall be released to Seller from the Escrow
Account and (ii) the remaining portion of the Payable Amount owed by Buyer
shall be paid by Buyer to Seller within 10 days after final determination of
such owed amounts in accordance herewith. However, in the event that the Buyer
Amount P-A-C is more than the Final Price (such difference, the "Refundable
Amount"), then (A) if the Refundable Amount is less than the Defect Escrow
Amount, (1) an amount that is equal to the Refundable Amount shall be released
to Buyer from the Escrow Account and (2) the remaining portion of the Defect
Escrow Amount shall be released to Seller or (B) if the Refundable Amount is
greater than the Defect Escrow Amount, (i) the Defect Escrow Amount shall be
released to Buyer from the Escrow Account and (ii) the remaining portion of
the Refundable Amount owed by Seller shall be paid by Seller to Buyer, in each
case, within 10 days after final determination of such owed amounts in
accordance herewith. For illustrative purposes only, Schedule 3.6(b) sets
forth examples of calculations for the Payable Amount and the Refundable
Amount. All amounts paid by any Party pursuant to this Section 3.6 shall be
delivered in United 

States currency by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified in writing by the relevant Party. The Parties shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to release the portions of the Defect Escrow Amount payable to
the applicable Party (or Parties) within the 10 day period referenced above.

(c) At the Closing, if applicable, Buyer shall deposit into the Escrow Account
an amount equal to the Defect Escrow Amount. For purposes of this Agreement,
the "Defect Escrow Amount" shall mean (i) the aggregate amount of Title Defect
Amounts asserted by Buyer with respect to all uncured Title Defects that were
timely and properly asserted by Buyer pursuant to Section 5.3(a) and that
Seller has timely elected to cure or that the Parties have not agreed upon
prior to the sixth Business Day prior to Closing, plus (ii) (A) the
Remediation Amounts asserted by Buyer for all uncured Environmental Defects
that were timely and properly asserted by Buyer pursuant to Section 6.1(a) and
that Seller has timely elected to cure or that the Parties have not agreed
upon prior to the sixth Business Day prior to Closing (including any dispute
as to whether Seller has cured such asserted Environmental Defects), and (B)
the Allocated Values of any Conveyed Interests for which any portion of a
Phase II ESA will be completed post-Closing pursuant to Section 4.1(b)(B) (for
purposes of this clause (c), "Phase II Conveyed Interests") less (iii) the
aggregate amount of Title Benefits Amounts (without duplication of any Title
Benefit Amounts already used hereunder to offset Title Defect Amounts and/or
Remediation Amounts) asserted by Seller with respect to all Title Benefits
that were timely and properly asserted by Seller pursuant to Section 5.3(b)
and that Buyer has conceded or are the subject of a Title Dispute, in each
case, after application of the Individual Title Defect Threshold, the
Individual Environmental Threshold, and (without duplication of the
application thereof) the Aggregate Deductible and other limitations set forth
in Section 5.3(i) or Section 6.1(e), as applicable. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Defect Escrow Amount shall be the amount of the Purchase Price
that, at Closing, has been reduced as a result of (A) uncured Title Defects
for which Seller has made a timely election to cure pursuant to Section
5.3(d), (B) Title Defects that the Parties have not agreed upon prior to the
sixth Business Day prior to Closing, (C) uncured Environmental Defects for
which Seller has made a timely election to cure pursuant to Section 6.1(c),
(D) Environmental Defects that the Parties have not agreed upon prior to the
sixth Business Day prior to Closing, and (E) Phase II Conveyed Interests, less
the Title Benefit Amounts referenced in clause (iii) above.

3.7 Disputes.

(a) If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve the matters addressed in a
Dispute Notice (if any), the Parties agree that for a 30 day period following
written notice from either Party, an officer or representative designated by
each Party shall attempt to resolve such dispute.

(b) If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve their dispute within the period
set forth in Section 3.7(a), either Party may initiate the arbitration process
set forth in this Section 3.7(b) by sending a written notice to the other
Party (the "Arbitration Notice"). Each Party shall within 14 Business Days
after the delivery of the Arbitration Notice, summarize its position with
regard to such dispute in a written document of 20 pages or less and submit
such summaries to the Dallas, Texas office of Deloitte and Touche LLP, or such
other Person as the Parties may mutually select (the "Accounting Arbitrator"),
together with the Dispute Notice, the Arbitration Notice, the Final 

Settlement Statement and any other documentation such Party may desire to
submit. Within 20 Business Days after receiving the Parties' respective
submissions, the Accounting Arbitrator shall render a decision choosing either
Seller's position or Buyer's position with respect to each matter addressed in
any Dispute Notice, based on the materials submitted to the Accounting
Arbitrator as described above. Any decision rendered by the Accounting
Arbitrator pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive and binding on Seller
and Buyer and will be taken into account as part of the Final Price
determination pursuant to Section 3.6 and will be enforceable against the
Parties in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Accounting Arbitrator
shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific
dispute submitted by either Party and may not award damages, interest or
penalties to either Party with respect to any matter, except as otherwise
provided in the following sentence. The costs of the Accounting Arbitrator and
the reasonable legal costs and other expenses incurred by the Parties in
connection with the arbitration shall be borne pro rata between the Parties
with each Party being responsible for such costs and expenses to the extent
the Accounting Arbitrator has not selected such Party's position on an
aggregate dollar basis with respect to all amounts submitted for resolution by
the Accounting Arbitrator.

3.8 Allocation of Purchase Price; Allocated Values. Solely for the purposes of
determining the value of Conveyed Interests in connection with any Title
Defect, Environmental Defect, Preferential Purchase Right, Required Consent,
and/or breach of Special Warranty under this Agreement and the value of the
Tag Interests, Buyer and Seller have allocated the Purchase Price among the
Conveyed Interests as set forth on Exhibit A and Exhibit B. The value so
allocated to a particular Conveyed Interest identified on Exhibit A and
Exhibit B may be referred to as "Allocated Value" for that Conveyed Interest.
Buyer and Seller agree that such allocation is reasonable and shall not take
any position inconsistent therewith, including notices to holders of
Preferential Purchase Rights. Neither Party, however, makes any
representations or warranties as to the accuracy of such value or allocation.

3.9 Allocation for Imbalances at Closing. If, prior to Closing, the Imbalances
set forth in Schedule 7.10 change or, prior to the date the Final Price is
determined as provided in Section 3.6 or 3.7, as applicable, either Party
discovers an error in the Imbalances set forth in Schedule 7.10, then the
Purchase Price shall be further adjusted pursuant to Section 3.3(a)(iv),
3.3(a)(v), 3.3(b)(vii), or 3.3(b)(viii) as applicable, and Schedule 7.10 will
be deemed amended immediately prior to Closing to reflect the Imbalances for
which the Purchase Price is so adjusted.

ARTICLE IV

ACCESS / DISCLAIMERS

4.1 Access.

(a) From and after the Execution Date and until two (2) Business Days prior to
Closing (or earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms
herein), but subject to the other provisions of this Section 4.1 and obtaining
any required consents of Third Parties, including Third Party operators of the
Subject Properties (with respect to which consents Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to request, but shall not be obligated to
expend any monies, except as may be agreed to be paid or reimbursed by Buyer),
Seller shall afford to Buyer and its authorized representatives ("Buyer's
Representatives") reasonable access, during normal business hours, to 

the Subject Properties, and all Records in Seller's or its Affiliates'
possession, at such time to the extent necessary to conduct investigations and
due diligence on the Conveyed Interests, including, prior to the Environmental
Defect Claim Date, the title or environmental review described in Article V
and Article VI. All investigations and due diligence conducted by Buyer or any
Buyer's Representative shall be conducted at Buyer's sole cost, risk and
expense and any conclusions made from any examination done by Buyer or any
Buyer's Representative shall result from Buyer's own independent review and
judgment.

(b) From the Execution Date until the Environmental Defect Claim Date, subject
to the terms and conditions below, Buyer's inspection right with respect to
the Environmental Condition of the Subject Properties shall be limited to
undertaking a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of the Subject Properties
conducted by Buyer's employees, or a reputable environmental consulting or
engineering firm approved in advance in writing by Seller (such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), and may include only
visual inspections and record reviews relating to the Subject Properties. In
conducting such inspection, Buyer shall not operate any equipment or conduct
any testing or sampling of soil, groundwater or other materials (including any
invasive testing or sampling for Hazardous Substances, Hydrocarbons or NORM).
Seller or Seller's designee shall have the right to be present during any
stage of the assessment. Buyer shall give Seller reasonable prior written
notice before gaining physical access to any of the Subject Properties, and
Seller or its designee shall have the right but not the obligation to
accompany Buyer and Buyer's Representatives whenever Buyer and/or Buyer's
Representatives gain physical access to any Subject Property. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, Buyer shall not have access to, and
shall not be permitted to conduct any inspections (including any Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment) with respect to, any Subject Property with
respect to which Seller does not have the authority to grant access for such
due diligence; provided that Seller shall reasonably request (with respect to
which request Seller shall not be obligated to expend any monies, unless Buyer
agrees to reimburse Seller therefor) access rights from Third Parties for
Buyer to conduct such inspections (including any Phase I Environmental Site
Assessment) with respect to, such Subject Property. Buyer will use reasonable
efforts to complete all such Phase I Environmental Site Assessments within 30
days of the Execution Date. If, and only if, Buyer in good faith believes that
a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment determines that Phase II sampling or
other invasive investigations ("Phase II ESA") are necessary in order for
Buyer to prove the existence of an Environmental Defect or establish a
defensible Remediation Amount with respect to the applicable Conveyed
Interest, Buyer shall, if it desires to perform a Phase II ESA as described in
such Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, (i) furnish Seller with a written
description of the proposed scope of such sampling or invasive activities,
including a description of the specific activities to be conducted, and a
description of the approximate location and expected timing of such
activities, which proposed scope shall be consistent with what was determined
to be necessary in the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (a "Phase II
Request"), and, (ii) subject to the preceding sentence, obtain the prior
written consent of Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed) to undertake the sampling or invasive activities
described in the Phase II Request. In the event that (A) (1) Seller does not
approve any such Phase II Request on any Subject Property operated by Seller
or its Affiliates within five Business Days of Buyer's delivery of such
request or (2) with respect to any other Subject Property, Buyer, due to un-
obtained consents or approvals of Third Parties with respect to accessing such
Subject Property, was unable to timely perform a 

Phase I Environmental Site Assessment or Phase II ESA, as the case may be,
Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to exclude any or all of
the affected Conveyed Interests from the transactions contemplated hereby, and
any such Conveyed Interests that are so excluded shall be deemed hereunder to
be Excluded Assets and Other Matters and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted
downward by the aggregate of the Allocated Values thereof or (B) Seller
provides its approval of the Phase II Request, the Environmental Defect Claim
Date, the Cure Period and the Dispute Date (in each case, with respect to the
affected Conveyed Interests only and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein) and all other associated dates herein will be extended for a
reasonable period of time (as set forth in the Phase II Request) in order for
Buyer to perform and complete its Phase II ESA, provided that (x) the Closing
will still occur on the Scheduled Closing Date for the affected Conveyed
Interests, (y) the Purchase Price will be reduced at Closing by an amount
equal to the Allocated Value of the affected Conveyed Interests and (z) the
applicable provisions herein with respect to uncured Environmental Defects
and/or Disputed Environmental Matters will apply mutatis mutandis to the
amounts placed in the Escrow Account pursuant to Section 3.6(c) for such
Conveyed Interests; provided, however, none of the foregoing shall apply to
any Subject Property that is operated by Buyer or its Affiliates or any
Subject Property in which Seller solely owns an overriding royalty interest.
Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in attempting to cause any Third
Party operator to provide Buyer with the requested access. If any of the
proposed sampling or invasive activities interfere with the normal operations
of the Subject Properties or otherwise may cause an undue risk of harm to the
site, Seller may request an appropriate modification of the proposed sampling
or invasive activities. Any sampling or invasive activities shall be conducted
by a reputable environmental consulting or engineering firm, approved in
advance by Seller (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned,
or delayed) and, once approved, such environmental consulting or engineering
firm shall be deemed to be a "Buyer's Representative." Buyer shall obtain all
permits necessary to conduct any approved sampling or invasive activities from
any applicable Governmental Authorities.

(c) Buyer shall coordinate its access rights, environmental property
assessments and physical inspections of the Subject Properties with Seller and
all Third Party operators, as applicable, to minimize any inconvenience to or
interruption of the conduct of business by Seller or any such Third Party
operator. Buyer shall abide by Seller's, and any Third Party operator's,
safety rules, regulations and operating policies (in each case, to the extent
communicated to Buyer) while conducting its due diligence evaluation of the
Properties, including any environmental or other inspection or assessment of
the Subject Properties and, to the extent reasonably required by any Third
Party operator, execute and deliver any access and bonding agreement required
by any such Third Party operator, in each case before conducting Buyer's
assessment on such Subject Property in accordance with this Section 4.1. Buyer
hereby defends, indemnifies, and holds harmless each of the operators of the
Subject Properties and each Seller Indemnified Party from and against any and
all Liabilities arising out of, resulting from or relating to any field visit,
environmental assessment or other due diligence activity conducted by Buyer or
any Buyer's Representative with respect to the Subject Properties, EVEN IF
SUCH LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THE SOLE,
ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR
OTHER FAULT OF, OR THE VIOLATION OF LAW BY, ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY,
EXCEPTING ONLY LIABILITIES TO THE EXTENT ACTUALLY RESULTING FROM THE GROSS
NEGLIGENCE 

OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY SUCH OPERATOR OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTIES OR ANY
SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY; provided that Buyer's indemnity shall not include
any Liabilities attributable to conditions or defects existing prior to such
due diligence activities (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Liabilities
arising out of, resulting from or relating to any Environmental Defects or
similar environmental matters discovered as part of a due diligence activity
of Buyer or Buyer's Representatives) except and solely to the extent
exacerbated, if at all, as a result of such due diligence activity of Buyer or
Buyer's Representatives.

(d) Buyer acknowledges that any entry into Seller's offices or onto the
Subject Properties shall be at Buyer's sole risk, cost and expense, and,
subject to the terms hereof, that none of the Seller Indemnified Parties shall
be liable in any way for any injury, loss or damage arising out of such entry
that may occur to Buyer or any of Buyer's Representatives pursuant to this
Agreement. Buyer hereby fully waives and releases any and all Liabilities
against all of the Seller Indemnified Parties for any injury, death, loss or
damage to any of Buyer's Representatives or their property in connection with
Buyer's due diligence activities, EVEN IF SUCH LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF OR
RESULT FROM, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR
COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OF, OR THE VIOLATION
OF LAW BY, ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY, EXCEPTING ONLY LIABILITIES ACTUALLY
RESULTING FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY SELLER
INDEMNIFIED PARTY.

(e) Buyer agrees to promptly provide Seller, but in no event less than five
days after receipt or creation thereof by Buyer or any of Buyer's
Representatives (including Buyer's environmental consulting or engineering
firm), copies of all final reports and test results prepared hereunder by
Buyer and/or any of Buyer's Representatives, which contain data collected or
generated from Buyer's and/or any of Buyer's Representatives' due diligence
with respect to the Conveyed Interests, including all environmental and title
reports. Seller shall not be deemed by its or its representatives' receipt of
said documents or otherwise to have made any representation or warranty,
express, implied or statutory, as to the condition of the Subject Properties
or to the accuracy of said documents or the information contained therein.

(f) Upon completion of Buyer's due diligence, Buyer shall at its sole cost and
expense and without any cost or expense to Seller or any of its Affiliates (i)
repair all damages to any Subject Properties to the extent caused by Buyer's
and/or any of Buyer's Representatives' due diligence (including due diligence
conducted by Buyer's environmental consulting or engineering firm), (ii) if
Buyer performed a Phase II ESA hereunder, restore the affected Subject
Properties to the approximate same condition as, or better condition than,
they were prior to commencement of any such Phase II ESA, and (iii) remove all
equipment, tools and other property brought onto the Subject Properties in
connection with such due diligence. Any disturbance to the Subject Properties
(including the leasehold associated therewith), to the extent resulting from
such due diligence, will be promptly corrected by Buyer at Buyer's sole cost
and expense.

(g) During all periods that Buyer and/or any of Buyer's Representatives
(including Buyer's environmental consulting or engineering firm) are on the
Subject Properties, Buyer shall maintain, at its sole cost and expense,
policies of insurance of the types and in the 

amounts held by Buyer immediately prior to the Execution Date. Coverage under
all insurance required to be carried by Buyer hereunder will (i) be primary
insurance, (ii) list the Seller Indemnified Parties as additional insureds,
(iii) waive subrogation against the Seller Indemnified Parties, and (iv)
provide for 30 days' prior written notice to Seller in the event of
cancellation, expiration, or modification of the policy or reduction in
coverage. Upon request by Seller, Buyer shall provide evidence of such
insurance to Seller prior to entering any of the Subject Properties.

4.2 Confidentiality. Buyer acknowledges that, pursuant to its right of access
to the Records or the Subject Properties, Buyer and/or Buyer's Representatives
(including Buyer's environmental consulting or engineering firm) will become
privy to confidential and other information of Seller and/or Seller's
Affiliates and Buyer shall ensure that such confidential information (a) shall
not be used by Buyer and Buyer's Representatives for any purpose other than in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) shall
be held confidential by Buyer and Buyer's Representatives (including Buyer's
environmental consulting or engineering firm) in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement. If the Closing should occur, the foregoing
confidentiality restriction on Buyer and the Confidentiality Agreement, shall
terminate as of the Closing Date (except as to (i) such portion of the
Conveyed Interests that are not conveyed to Buyer pursuant to the provisions
of this Agreement, (ii) the Excluded Assets and Other Matters, and (iii)
information related to Seller, Seller's Affiliates, or any assets other than
the Subject Properties). Further, if the Closing should occur, the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement will apply mutatis mutandis to
Seller and its Affiliates (as if it, and they, were the "Recipient"
thereunder) for a period equal to the initial term of the Confidentiality
Agreement, it being the intent of the Parties that Seller will treat the
"Confidential Information" (as defined therein) in strict confidence for such
period after the Closing. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, this Section 4.2 shall not limit or otherwise modify the
confidentiality restrictions in the License Agreement.

ARTICLE V

TITLE MATTERS; CASUALTY; TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

5.1 General Disclaimer of Title Warranties and Representations. Except for the
Special Warranty set forth in the Assignment and without limiting Buyer's
remedies for Title Defects set forth in this Article V, Seller makes no
warranty or representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with
respect to Seller's title to any of the Conveyed Interests, and Buyer hereby
acknowledges and agrees that Buyer's sole remedy for any defect of title,
including any Title Defect, with respect to Seller's title to any of the
Conveyed Interests (a) before Closing, shall be as set forth in Section 5.3
and, if applicable, Section 14.1(e), and (b) from and after Closing, shall be
(i) with respect to Title Defects for which the Title Defect Amount therefor
comprises part of the Defect Escrow Amount, pursuant to Sections 3.6, 5.3(d)
and 5.3(j) (along with any associated provisions in this Agreement), as
applicable, in each case, however, subject to Section 5.3(i), and (ii) in all
other instances, pursuant to the Special Warranty set forth in the Assignment
and in compliance with, and subject to, Section 5.2 below and, if applicable,
any Title Indemnity Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (A)
the Parties acknowledge and agree that none of Seller's representations and
warranties in Article VII will be deemed representations or warranties with
respect to Seller's title to any of the Conveyed Interests and, (B) for the
avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall have the right hereunder to assert Title
Defects (subject to the provisions of Section 5.3) of which Buyer's or any of
its Affiliates' employees, title attorneys, landmen or other title examiners
were aware prior to the Execution Date (including matters with respect to the
partial releases referenced in Section 5.2(a)(ii), with respect to which,
Seller shall promptly provide Buyer, upon Buyer's request during the Interim
Period, with copies of, or access to, any such releases in Seller's or its
Affiliates' possession for purposes of Buyer completing its title diligence
pursuant to Section 5.3).

5.2 Special Warranty.

(a) Special Warranty of Title. If Closing occurs, then the Assignment shall
contain a special warranty of title whereby Seller shall, until the end of the
Survival Period, warrant Defensible Title, without duplication, to the Leases
set forth on Exhibit A (limited to the Eagle Ford Formation) and to the Wells
set forth in Exhibit B (limited to the currently producing formation for 

each such Well), unto Buyer against every Person whomsoever lawfully claiming
or to claim the same or any part thereof by, through or under Seller, but not
otherwise, subject, however, to the Permitted Encumbrances (the "Special
Warranty"); provided, however, that, (i) except with respect to any liability
of Seller for any claim asserted in writing by Buyer to Seller in accordance
with this Section 5.2 and the Assignment before the expiration of the Survival
Period for breach of the Special Warranty, the Special Warranty shall cease
and terminate at the end of the Survival Period, and (ii) notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller's release of any depths
covered by a Lease pursuant to a partial release of that Lease (including any
Third Party claims with respect to those depths released) shall not constitute
a breach of the Special Warranty. The Special Warranty shall be subject to the
further limitations and provisions of this Section 5.2.

(b) Recovery on Special Warranty.

(i) Buyer's Assertion of Special Warranty Breaches. Prior to the expiration of
the period of time commencing as of the Closing Date and ending at 5:00 p.m.
(Central Time) on the fourth anniversary thereof (the "Survival Period"),
Buyer shall be entitled to furnish Seller a Title Defect Notice meeting the
requirements of Section 5.3(a) setting forth any and all matters which Buyer
intends to assert as a breach of the Special Warranty (collectively, the
"Special Warranty Notices" and, individually, a "Special Warranty Notice").
Seller shall have a reasonable opportunity, but not the obligation, to cure
any breach of the Special Warranty asserted by Buyer pursuant to this Section
5.2(b). Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with any attempt by Seller to cure
any such breach. For all purposes of this Agreement, Buyer shall be deemed to
have waived, and Seller shall have no further liability for, any breach of the
Special Warranty that Buyer fails to assert by a Special Warranty Notice given
to Seller before the expiration of the Survival Period.

(ii) Limitations on Special Warranty. Recovery by Buyer for any breach by
Seller of the Special Warranty shall be limited to an amount (without any
interest accruing thereon) equal to the reduction to the Purchase Price to
which Buyer would have been entitled had Buyer asserted the defect giving rise
to such breach of the Special Warranty as a Title Defect prior to the Title
Defect Claim Date pursuant to Section 5.3 and taking into account the last
sentence of this Section 5.2(b)(ii), and in no event shall that recovery
(together with any other Title Defect recoveries and Purchase Price
adjustments with respect to such Conveyed Interest) exceed the Allocated Value
of the affected Conveyed Interest. The Individual Title Defect Threshold and
Aggregate Deductible shall not apply to any recovery for any breach by Seller
of the Special Warranty, and Buyer shall not be entitled to recover any amount
for any breach of the Special Warranty to the extent that the Purchase Price
is or has been reduced for the same Title Defect pursuant to Section
5.3(d)(i).

5.3 Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments.

(a) Title Defect Notices. Prior to the Title Defect Claim Date, Buyer must
deliver claim notices to Seller meeting the requirements of this Section
5.3(a) (collectively, the "Title Defect Notices" and, individually, a "Title
Defect Notice") setting forth any matters which, in Buyer's reasonable
opinion, constitute Title Defects and which Buyer intends to assert as a Title
Defect pursuant to this Section 5.3(a). For all purposes of this Agreement and
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall be deemed to have
waived, and Seller shall have no liability for, 

any Title Defect which Buyer fails to assert as a Title Defect by a properly
delivered Title Defect Notice received by Seller before the Title Defect Claim
Date; provided, however, that, for purposes of the Special Warranty, such
waiver shall not apply to any matter that, prior to the Title Defect Claim
Date, is not discovered by any of Buyer's or any of its Affiliates' employees,
title attorneys, landmen or other title examiners while conducting Buyer's due
diligence with respect to the Conveyed Interests that in Buyer's reasonable
opinion constitutes a breach by Seller of the Special Warranty. To be
effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing, and shall include (i)
a description of the alleged Title Defect and the individual Well or Lease
affected by the alleged Title Defect (each such Conveyed Interest, a "Title
Defect Property"), (ii) the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property,
(iii) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the
existence of the alleged Title Defect with respect to the Title Defect
Property (any and all of which supporting documents may be furnished via
access to a web link or ftp site (in lieu of other means of delivery)), and
(iv) the amount by which Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated Value of the
Title Defect Property is reduced by such alleged Title Defect and the
computations upon which Buyer's belief is based, in each case, in accordance
with Section 5.3(g). Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, and for the avoidance of doubt, any Title Defect asserted by
Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.3(a) and any breach of the Special Warranty
asserted by Buyer pursuant to Section 5.2(b) shall be limited to the Leases
set forth on Exhibit A (as to the Eagle Ford Formation only) and the Wells set
forth on Exhibit B (as to the currently producing formation for each such
Well) and Buyer shall not have the right to assert Title Defects or breach of
the Special Warranty with respect to any other depths or formations or any
other Conveyed Interests. To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing
and curing Title Defects, Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to give
Seller, on or before the end of each calendar week prior to the Title Defect
Claim Date, written notice of all alleged Title Defects (as well as any claims
that would be claims under the Special Warranty) discovered by Buyer during
the preceding calendar week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and
supplemented prior to the Title Defect Claim Date.

(b) Title Benefit Notices. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to deliver to Buyer on or before the Title Defect Claim Date, with
respect to each Title Benefit which it discovers after the Execution Date, a
notice (a "Title Benefit Notice") including (i) a description of the alleged
Title Benefit and the individual Well or Lease, or portion thereof, affected
by such alleged Title Benefit (each such Conveyed Interest, a "Title Benefit
Property"), and (ii) with respect to each Title Benefit Property, the amount
by which Seller reasonably believes the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit
Property is increased by such alleged Title Benefit, and the computations upon
which Seller's belief is based. Seller shall be deemed to have waived any
Title Benefit which Seller fails to assert as a Title Benefit by a Title
Benefit Notice delivered to Buyer on or before the Title Defect Claim Date.

(c) Seller's Right to Cure. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure any Title Defects timely and
properly alleged under Section 5.3(a) at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. Central
Time on the date that is 45 days after the Closing Date (the "Cure Period"),
provided that Seller has notified Buyer under Section 5.3(d)(i) of its
election to cure such Title Defects no later than the sixth Business Day prior
to Closing. During the period of time from Closing to the expiration of the
Cure Period, Buyer agrees to afford Seller and its officers, employees and
other authorized representatives reasonable access, during normal business
hours, 

to the Subject Properties and all Records in Buyer's or any of its Affiliates'
possession in order to facilitate Seller's attempt to cure any such Title
Defects (and if Seller and/or its representatives access the Subject
Properties in connection with such right to cure, the provisions herein
setting forth the terms and conditions of Buyer's (and Buyer's
Representatives') access to the Subject Properties and the Records prior to
the Closing will, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, apply mutatis
mutandis to Seller and its representatives). An election by Seller to attempt
to cure a Title Defect shall be without prejudice to its rights under Section
5.3(j) and shall not constitute an admission against interest or a waiver of
Seller's right to dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure,
the alleged Title Defect.

(d) Remedies for Title Defects. Subject to Seller's continuing right to
dispute the existence of a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect Amount
asserted with respect thereto as described in Section 5.3(j), and subject to
the rights of the Parties pursuant to Section 14.1(e), in the event that any
Title Defect timely and properly asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section
5.3(a) is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured on or before the sixth
Business Day prior to Closing, Seller shall, at its sole option, elect to:

(i) subject to Section 5.3(i), assign the Title Defect Property to Buyer at
Closing and reduce the Purchase Price at Closing by the Title Defect Amount
determined pursuant to Section 5.3(g) (as asserted by Buyer in good faith as
part of a Title Defect Notice timely and properly alleged under Section
5.3(a)), provided that Seller will have the right for the Cure Period (in
accordance with Section 5.3(c)) to cure the Title Defect relating to such
assigned Title Defect Property, and should Seller cure such Title Defect, then
such cure will be taken into account in the Final Settlement Statement
delivered pursuant to Section 3.6; or

(ii) subject to Section 5.3(i), with Buyer's consent, at its sole option,
indemnify Buyer against all Liability (up to the Allocated Value of the
applicable Title Defect Property and subject to the Individual Title Defect
Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible) resulting from such Title Defect with
respect to such Title Defect Property pursuant to an indemnity agreement
prepared by Seller in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer (a
"Title Indemnity Agreement");

provided that, subject to Section 5.3(i), with respect to any Title Defect
(including the Title Defect Amount with respect to such Title Defect) that the
Parties have not agreed upon prior to the sixth Business Day prior to Closing,
the Title Defect Property for said Title Defect will be included with the
Conveyed Interests conveyed to Buyer at Closing and the Purchase Price will be
reduced at Closing by the asserted Title Defect Amount (as asserted by Buyer
in good faith as part of a Title Defect Notice timely and properly alleged
under Section 5.3(a)) of the Title Defect Property affected by such Title
Defect; and, provided, further, that the Final Price shall be adjusted to take
into account the resolution of all Title Disputes after Closing (either by
agreement of the Parties or as a result of the determination of the Title
Arbitrator under Section 5.3(j)), any Title Defects cured by Seller during the
Cure Period, and the application of Section 5.3(i).

(e) Remedies for Title Benefits. With respect to each Title Benefit Property
timely and properly reported under Section 5.3(b), Buyer shall notify Seller
in writing on or before the date that is six Business Days prior to Closing
whether Buyer (i) concedes the Title Benefit 

asserted therein, or (ii) disputes such Title Benefit, in which case such
Title Benefit shall be deemed to be a Title Dispute and the provisions of
Section 5.3(j) shall apply. For the avoidance of doubt, Title Benefits Amounts
shall in no event increase the Purchase Price and will only be used to offset
Title Defect Amounts hereunder.

(f) Exclusive Remedy. Except for Buyer's rights under the Special Warranty and
Buyer's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(e), (i)
Section 5.3(d) shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect
to Seller's failure to have Defensible Title with respect to any Lease or
Well, or any other title matter with respect to any Subject Property, and (ii)
Buyer hereby waives any and all other rights or remedies with respect thereto.

(g) Title Defect Amount. The amount by which the Allocated Value of a Title
Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of a Title Defect
shall be the "Title Defect Amount" for such Title Defect Property and shall be
determined in accordance with the following terms and conditions (without
duplication):

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

(ii) if the Title Defect with respect to such Title Defect Property is an
Encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect
Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect
from such Title Defect Property;

(iii) if the Title Defect with respect to such Title Defect Property
represents a decrease of (A) Seller's Net Revenue Interest for such Title
Defect Property such that Seller's Net Revenue Interest for such Title Defect
Property is less than (B) the Net Revenue Interest set forth for such Title
Defect Property on Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable, then the Title
Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect
Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest set
forth for such Title Defect Property on Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable;

(iv) if the Title Defect with respect to such Title Defect Property represents
an increase of (A) Seller's Working Interest for such Title Defect Property
such that Seller's Working Interest for such Title Defect Property is in
excess of (B) the Working Interest set forth for such Title Defect Property on
Exhibit B by not more than 10% (on an 8/8ths basis), without any increase of
Seller's Net Revenue Interest for such Title Defect Property, then the Title
Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect
Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Working
Interest increase and the denominator of which is the Working Interest set
forth for such Title Defect Property on Exhibit B;

(v) if the Title Defect with respect to such Title Defect Property represents
a discrepancy where (A) the actual Net Acres for such Title Defect Property is
less than (B) the Net Acres set forth on Exhibit A for such Title Defect
Property, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product obtained by
multiplying such Net Acre decrease by the Allocated Value (on a per Net Acre
dollar amount basis) for such Title Defect Property; 

(vi) if the Title Defect represents an obligation or Encumbrance upon or other
defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described above,
then the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect
Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect,
the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title
Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller
and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation; provided, however, that if such Title Defect is reasonably capable
of being cured, the Title Defect Amount shall not be greater than the
Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property;

(vii) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

(viii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article V, the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property;

provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Title Defect
(other than a Title Defect affecting a Title Defect Property in which Seller
only owns an overriding royalty interest) results in the Seller's Net Revenue
Interest in any Well or Lease being equal to or less than 70% (proportionately
reduced based on Seller's Working Interest therein), the Title Defect Amount
with respect to such Well or Lease shall be determined in accordance with
Section 5.3(g)(vi), rather than Section 5.3(g)(iii).

(h) Title Benefit Amount. The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title
Benefit shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology,
terms and conditions (without duplication):

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

(ii) if the Title Benefit with respect to a Title Benefit Property represents
an increase of (A) Seller's Net Revenue Interest for any Title Benefit
Property such that Seller's Net Revenue Interest for such Title Benefit
Property is greater than (B) the Net Revenue Interest set forth for such Title
Benefit Property on Exhibit A or Exhibit B, without any increase of Seller's
Working Interest for such Title Defect Property, then the Title Benefit Amount
shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
increase and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest set forth
for such Title Benefit Property on Exhibit A or Exhibit B;

(iii) if the Title Benefit with respect to a Title Benefit Property represents
a discrepancy where (A) the actual Net Acres for such Title Defect Property is
greater than (B) the Net Acres set forth on Exhibit A for such Title Benefit
Property, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be the product obtained by
multiplying such Net Acre increase by the Allocated Value (on a per Net Acre
dollar amount basis) for such Title Benefit Property; and 

(iv) if the Title Benefit is of a type not described above (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the circumstances where a Title Benefit affects a portion,
but not the entirety of any Well or Lease), then the Title Benefit Amounts
shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title
Benefit Property, the portion of such Title Benefit Property affected by such
Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential economic
effect of the Title Benefit over the life of such Title Benefit Property, the
values placed upon the Title Benefit by Buyer and Seller and such other
reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation.

(i) Title Defect Threshold and Deductible. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this
Section 5.3(i), with respect to any Title Defect timely and properly asserted
under Section 5.3(a), (A) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the
Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller hereunder for any Title
Defect with respect to a Title Defect Property (or Title Defects, if more than
one Title Defect affects the Title Defect Property) for which the Title Defect
Amount (or aggregate Title Defect Amount(s) of the Title Defects affecting the
Title Defect Property, if applicable), in each case, does not exceed the
lesser of (x) $40,000 and (y) 75% of the Allocated Value of the relevant Title
Defect Property (such lesser amount, the "Individual Title Defect Threshold");
and (B) in no event shall there be any adjustment to the Purchase Price or
other remedies provided by Seller hereunder for any Title Defect with respect
to a Title Defect Property for which the Title Defect Amount (or Title Defect
Amounts, if applicable) exceeds the Individual Title Defect Threshold unless
(1) the amount of the sum of (I) (x) the aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all
such Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold (as
determined in accordance with (A) above, but excluding any Title Defect
Amounts attributable to Title Defects cured by Seller) less (y) the aggregate
Title Benefit Amount of all Title Benefits, plus (II) the aggregate
Remediation Amounts of all Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual
Environmental Threshold (as determined in accordance with Section 6.1(e), but
excluding any Remediation Amounts attributable to Conveyed Interests subject
to Environmental Defects that are retained by Seller pursuant to Section
6.1(c) and any Environmental Defects cured by Seller), exceeds (2) the
Aggregate Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments
to the Purchase Price or other applicable remedies available hereunder, but
only to the extent that the amount by which the aggregate amount of such Title
Defect Amounts and Remediation Amounts exceeds the Aggregate Deductible. For
the avoidance of doubt, a Title Defect Property shall refer to the individual
Lease or Well affected by a Title Defect and, if a Title Defect affects both a
Lease and a Well (or multiple Leases or Wells), the Title Defect Amounts with
respect to such Title Defects shall not be aggregated when determining whether
the Individual Title Defect Threshold has been satisfied. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Individual Title Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible
shall not apply to any Title Defect timely and properly asserted under Section
5.3(a) with respect to any of the Leases set forth on Schedule 5.3(i).

(j) Title Dispute Resolution. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on
matters regarding (i) all Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts
and Title Benefit Amounts, and (ii) the adequacy of any curative materials
provided by Seller to cure any alleged Title Defect (collectively "Title
Disputes") prior to the Dispute Date. If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree
by the Dispute Date, the Title Disputes shall be exclusively and finally
resolved pursuant to this Section 5.3(j). There shall be a single arbitrator,
who shall be a title attorney with at least 10 years' experience in oil and
gas titles involving properties in the regional area in which the Conveyed 

Interests are located, as selected by the mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller
within 15 days after the Dispute Date (the "Title Arbitrator"). If the Parties
do not mutually agree upon the Title Arbitrator in accordance with this
Section 5.3(j), the Dallas, Texas office of the AAA shall appoint the Title
Arbitrator under such conditions as the AAA in its sole discretion deems
necessary or advisable. The place of arbitration shall be Dallas, Texas, and
the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the AAA Rules, to the
extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section 5.3(j). Each
of Buyer and Seller shall submit to the Title Arbitrator, with a simultaneous
copy to the other Party, its proposed resolution of the applicable Title
Dispute no later than 10 Business Days after the appointment of the Title
Arbitrator pursuant to this Section 5.3(j). The proposed resolution of the
applicable Title Dispute shall include the best offer of the submitting Party
in a single monetary amount that such Party is willing to pay or accept (as
applicable) to settle the applicable Title Dispute. The Title Arbitrator's
determination shall be made within 20 days after the end of such 10 Business
Day period after the submission of the Title Disputes and shall be final and
binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In making his
determination, the Title Arbitrator shall make a determination of the Title
Disputes submitted based solely on the single written submission of Seller and
Buyer (and without any additional or supplemental submittals by any Party,
except to the extent the Title Arbitrator requests additional information from
either Party), shall be bound by the rules set forth in this Section 5.3 and,
subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters as, in the opinion
of the Title Arbitrator, are necessary to make a proper determination. The
Title Arbitrator, however, may not award Buyer a greater Title Defect Amount
than the Title Defect Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Title Defect
Notice or a lesser Title Defect Amount than the Title Defect Amount stated by
Seller in its applicable position statement delivered to the Title Arbitrator;
or, in the case of Title Benefits, a greater Title Benefit Amount than that
claimed by Seller in its applicable Title Benefit Notice or a lesser Title
Benefit Amount that claimed by Buyer in its applicable position statement
delivered to the Title Arbitrator. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert
for the limited purpose of determining the specific Title Disputes submitted
by either Party, and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either
Party with respect to any matter except as otherwise provided in the following
sentence. The costs of the Title Arbitrator (and the AAA, if applicable) and
the reasonable legal costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection
with the arbitration shall be borne pro rata between the Parties with each
Party being responsible for such costs and expenses to the extent the Title
Arbitrator has not selected such Party's position on an aggregate dollar basis
with respect to all amounts submitted for resolution by the Title Arbitrator.

5.4 Casualty or Condemnation Loss.

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, but without prejudice to
Buyer's rights and remedies under Section 13.2(a) (with respect to a breach of
Section 7.8 or Section 7.18), Section 13.2(b) (with respect to a breach of
Section 9.1), and/or Section 13.2(c) (with respect to the Specified
Obligations described in clause (v) of Section 13.1(b)), in each case, to the
limited extent expressly set forth in such Sections, from and after the
Effective Time, if Closing occurs, Buyer shall assume all risk of loss with
respect to production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including
watering out of any well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any well)
and the depreciation of Conveyed Interests due to ordinary wear and tear, in
each case, with respect to 

the Conveyed Interests, and Buyer shall not assert such matters as Casualty
Losses or Title Defects hereunder.

(b) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of
the Conveyed Interests is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or is
taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain (each, a "Casualty
Loss") (excluding any of the Conveyed Interests affected by a Casualty Loss
that, prior to Closing, Seller has (y) replaced with property of an equivalent
or better condition and/or (z) repaired to an equivalent or better condition,
in each case, as of the Effective Time), and the Closing thereafter occurs,
(i) if such Casualty Losses exceed, in the aggregate, $2,000,000, there will
be a downward adjustment to the Purchase Price in the amount of such Casualty
Losses or (ii) if such Casualty Losses do not exceed, in the aggregate,
$2,000,000, Seller, at Closing, shall pay to Buyer all sums actually paid to
Seller by Third Parties by reason of any Casualty Loss insofar as with respect
to the Conveyed Interests and shall assign, transfer and set over to Buyer or
subrogate Buyer to all of Seller's or its Affiliates right, title and interest
(if any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards, and other rights against Third
Parties (excluding any Liabilities, other than insurance claims, of or against
any Seller Indemnified Party) arising out of such Casualty Loss insofar as
with respect to the Conveyed Interests; provided, however, that in the event
that, at Closing, clause (i) above is applicable as a result of Casualty
Losses occurring during the Interim Period, Seller shall reserve and retain
(and Buyer shall assign to Seller) all right, title, and interest in and to
such insurance claims, unpaid awards, other rights against Third Parties, and
sums paid to Seller by Third Parties; provided, further, that, in all cases,
Seller shall reserve and retain (and Buyer shall assign to Seller) all right,
title, interest and claims against Third Parties for the recovery of Seller's
costs and expenses incurred prior to Closing in repairing such Casualty Loss
and/or pursuing or asserting any such insurance claims or other rights against
Third Parties.

5.5 Preferential Purchase Rights and Consents to Assign.

(a) With respect to each Preferential Purchase Right set forth on Schedule
7.9, not later than 10 days after the Execution Date (and, with respect to
each Preferential Purchase Right that is not set forth on Schedule 7.9 but is
discovered by either Party after the Execution Date and before the Closing
Date, not later than 10 days after the discovery thereof), Seller shall send
to the holder of each such Preferential Purchase Right a notice in compliance
with the contractual provisions applicable to such Preferential Purchase
Right, requesting a waiver of such Preferential Purchase Right.

(i) If, prior to Closing, any holder of a Preferential Purchase Right notifies
Seller that it intends to consummate the purchase of the Conveyed Interests to
which its Preferential Purchase Right applies, then the Conveyed Interest
subject to such Preferential Purchase Right shall be excluded from the
Conveyed Interests to be assigned to Buyer at Closing (but only to the extent
of the portion of such Conveyed Interest affected by the Preferential Purchase
Right), and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the
Conveyed Interest (or portion thereof) so excluded. Seller shall be entitled
to all proceeds paid by any Person exercising a Preferential Purchase Right
prior to Closing. If, on or before 90 days following the Closing Date, such
holder of such Preferential Purchase Right fails to consummate the purchase of
the Conveyed Interest (or portion thereof) covered by such Preferential
Purchase Right (on the same terms and 

conditions hereof) then (A) Seller shall so notify Buyer, (B) Buyer shall
purchase, on or before 5 Business Days following receipt of such notice, such
Conveyed Interest (or portion thereof) that was so excluded from the Conveyed
Interests to be assigned to Buyer at Closing, under the terms of this
Agreement and for a price equal to the amount by which the Purchase Price was
reduced at Closing with respect to such excluded Conveyed Interest (or portion
thereof) (as such amount is appropriately adjusted in accordance with the
other terms of this Agreement) and (C) Seller shall assign to Buyer the
Conveyed Interest (or portion thereof) so excluded at Closing pursuant to an
instrument in substantially the same form as the Assignment.

(ii) All Conveyed Interests for which any applicable Preferential Purchase
Right has been waived, or as to which the period to exercise the applicable
Preferential Purchase Right has expired without exercise by the holder
thereof, in each case, prior to Closing, shall be sold to Buyer at Closing
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. If, as of Closing, the time for
exercising a Preferential Purchase Right has not expired and such Preferential
Purchase Right has not been exercised or waived, then the Conveyed Interest
subject to such Preferential Purchase Right shall be included in the Conveyed
Interests to be assigned to Buyer at Closing, and Buyer shall be solely
responsible for complying with the terms of such Preferential Purchase Right
and shall be entitled to the proceeds, if any, associated with the exercise of
such Preferential Purchase Right.

(b) With respect to each Consent set forth on Schedule 7.4, Seller, not later
than 10 days after the Execution Date (and, with respect to each Consent that
is not set forth on Schedule 7.4 but is discovered by either Party after the
Execution Date and before the Closing Date, not later than 10 days after the
discovery thereof), shall send to the holder of each such Consent a notice in
material compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such Consent
seeking such holder's consent to the transactions contemplated hereby.

(i) If Seller fails to obtain a Consent set forth in Schedule 7.4 (or any
Consent that is not set forth in Schedule 7.4 but is discovered by either
Party after the Execution Date and before the Closing Date) prior to Closing
and the failure to obtain such Consent would cause (A) the assignment of the
Conveyed Interests affected thereby to Buyer to be void or nullified, (B) the
termination of a Lease or an Applicable Contract, or (C) the assessment of a
payment, fine or monetary penalty, in each case, pursuant to the express terms
of the Lease, Applicable Contract, or other instrument requiring such Consent,
as the case may be (each, a "Required Consent"), then, in each case, the
Conveyed Interest (or portion thereof) subject to such un‑obtained Consent and
any associated Conveyed Interests shall be excluded from the Conveyed
Interests to be assigned to Buyer at Closing, and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of such Conveyed Interest (or portion thereof)
and such associated Conveyed Interests so excluded. In the event that a
Required Consent (with respect to a Conveyed Interest excluded pursuant to
this Section 5.5(b)(i)) that was not obtained prior to Closing is obtained
within 180 days following Closing, then, within 10 Business Days after such
Consent is obtained (x) Buyer shall purchase the Conveyed Interest (or portion
thereof) and any associated Conveyed Interests that were so excluded as a
result of such previously un‑obtained Consent and pay to Seller the amount by
which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing with respect to the Conveyed
Interest (or portion thereof) and any associated Conveyed Interests so
excluded (as such amount is appropriately adjusted in accordance with the 

other terms of this Agreement) and (y) Seller shall assign to Buyer the
Conveyed Interest (or portion thereof) and any associated Conveyed Interests
so excluded at Closing pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same
form as the Assignment.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but without
prejudice to Buyer's rights and remedies under Sections 13.2 and/or 14.1(d)
(in each case, as to breaches of this Section 5.5(b) or Section 7.4), if
Seller fails to obtain a Consent other than a Required Consent, then the
Conveyed Interest (or portion thereof) subject to such un‑obtained Consent
shall nevertheless be assigned by Seller to Buyer at Closing as part of the
Conveyed Interests and, Buyer shall have no claim against Seller, and Seller
shall have no Liability, for the failure to obtain such Consent.

(iii) Prior to Closing, Seller and Buyer shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents listed on Schedule 7.4 (and any
Required Consent that is not set forth in Schedule 7.4 but is discovered by
either Party after the Execution Date and before the Closing Date); provided,
however, that neither Party shall be required to incur any Liability or pay
any money in order to obtain any such Consent (unless Buyer elects to pay for
or reimburse Seller for any such Liability or payment of monies). Subject to
the foregoing, Buyer agrees to provide Seller with any information or
documentation that may be reasonably requested by Seller and/or the Third
Party holder(s) of such Consents, including evidence of financial capability
and bonding, in order to facilitate the process of obtaining such Consents.

ARTICLE VI 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

6.1 Environmental Defects. 

(a) Assertions of Environmental Defects. Buyer must deliver claim notices to
Seller meeting the requirements of this Section 6.1(a) (collectively the
"Environmental Defect Notices" and individually an "Environmental Defect
Notice") not later than the Environmental Defect Claim Date setting forth any
matters which, in Buyer's reasonable opinion, constitute Environmental Defects
and which Buyer intends to assert as Environmental Defects pursuant to this
Section 6.1. Except for, and without prejudice to, Buyer's right to
indemnification pursuant to (w) Section 13.2(a) (with respect to a breach by
Seller of Section 7.15), (x) Section 13.2(b) (with respect to a breach by
Seller of Section 9.1), (y) Section 13.2(d)(i) and/or (z) Section 13.2(d)(ii)
(in each case to the limited extent expressly set forth in such Sections),
Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Seller shall have no liability for,
any Environmental Defect which Buyer fails to assert as an Environmental
Defect by a properly delivered Environmental Defect Notice received by Seller,
before the Environmental Defect Claim Date, with such liabilities being
"Buyer's Environmental Liabilities." To be effective, each Environmental
Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a description of the
matter constituting the alleged Environmental Condition (including the
applicable Environmental Law violated or implicated thereby) and the Conveyed
Interests affected by such alleged Environmental Condition (each, an
"Environmental Defect Property"), (ii) the Allocated Value of each
Environmental Defect Property (or portions thereof) affected by such alleged
Environmental Condition, (iii) supporting documents reasonably necessary for
Seller to verify the existence of such alleged Environmental Condition (any
and all of which supporting documents may be furnished via access to a web
link or ftp site (in lieu of other means of delivery)), and (iv) a calculation
of the Remediation Amount (itemized in reasonable detail) that Buyer asserts
is attributable to such alleged Environmental Condition with respect to each
Environmental Defect Property. Buyer's calculation of the Remediation Amount
included in the Environmental Defect Notice must describe in reasonable detail
the Remediation proposed for the alleged Environmental Condition that gives
rise to the asserted Environmental Defect and identify all assumptions used by
Buyer in calculating the Remediation Amount, including the standards that
Buyer asserts must be met to comply with Environmental Laws.

(b) Seller's Right to Cure. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to cure any asserted Environmental Defect at any time prior to the
expiration of the Cure Period, provided that Seller has notified Buyer under
Section 6.1(c)(i) of its election to cure such Environmental Defects no later
than the sixth Business Day prior to Closing. During the period of time from
Closing to the expiration of the Cure Period, Buyer agrees to afford Seller
and its officers, employees, and other authorized representatives reasonable
access, during normal business hours, to the Subject Properties and all
Records in Buyer's or any of its Affiliates' possession in order to facilitate
Seller's attempt to cure any Environmental Defects, and if Seller and/or its
representatives access the Subject Properties in connection with such right to
cure, the provisions herein setting forth the terms and conditions of Buyer's
(and Buyer's Representatives') access to the Subject Properties prior to the
Closing will, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, apply mutatis mutandis
to Seller and its representatives. To give Seller an opportunity to commence
reviewing and curing Environmental Defects, Buyer agrees to use reasonable
efforts to give Seller, on or before the end of each calendar week prior to
the Environmental Defect Claim Date, written notice of all alleged
Environmental Defects discovered by Buyer during the preceding calendar week,
which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the
Environmental Defect Claim Date. 

(c) Remedies for Environmental Defects. Subject to Seller's continuing right
to dispute the existence of an Environmental Defect and/or the Remediation
Amount asserted with respect thereto as described in Section 6.1(f), and
subject to the rights of the Parties pursuant to Section 14.1(e), in the event
that any Environmental Defect timely and properly asserted by Buyer in
accordance with Section 6.1(a) is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured on
or before the sixth Business Day prior to Closing, Seller shall, at its sole
option, elect to:

(i) subject to Section 6.1(e), assign the Environmental Defect Property to
Buyer at Closing and reduce the Purchase Price at Closing by the Remediation
Amount, provided that Seller will have the right until the expiration of the
Cure Period (in accordance with Section 6.1(b)) to cure the Environmental
Defect relating to such assigned Environmental Defect Property, and should
Seller cure such Environmental Defect, then such cure will be taken into
account in the Final Settlement Statement delivered pursuant to Section 3.6;

(ii) retain the entirety of the Environmental Defect Property, in which event
the Environmental Defect Property will be excluded from the Conveyed Interests
at Closing and the Purchase Price shall be reduced at Closing by an amount
equal to the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Property; or

(iii) subject to Section 6.1(e), with Buyer's consent, at its sole option,
indemnify Buyer against all Liability resulting from such Environmental Defect
with respect to the Conveyed Interests pursuant to an indemnity agreement
prepared by Seller in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer
(each, an "Environmental Indemnity Agreement");

provided that, subject to Section 6.1(e), if the Remediation Amount (as
asserted by Buyer in good faith as part of an Environmental Defect Notice that
is timely and properly asserted pursuant to Section 6.1(a)) for any
Environmental Defect Property exceeds the greater of (1) $150,000 and (2) the
Allocated Value of the Environmental Defect Property, and such Environmental
Defect is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured during the Cure Period,
either Party may, at its sole option, elect to exclude the Environmental
Defect Property from the Conveyed Interests by delivering a notice to the
other Party, in which event Buyer shall promptly assign to Seller such
Conveyed Interests, such Conveyed Interests will constitute Excluded Assets
and Other Matters, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal
to the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect (which adjustment shall be
taken into account in the Final Settlement Statement); provided, however, that
any such assignment to Seller shall not take place until such time as a
determination can be made under Section 6.1(e) as to whether an adjustment to
the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller (including the
Parties' ability to elect to exclude an Environmental Defect Property as set
forth above) are available to Buyer after application of Section 6.1(e), and
in the event that after application of Section 6.1(e), no Purchase Price
adjustment or other remedies provided by Seller are available to Buyer, Buyer
shall retain the Environmental Defect Property and it shall remain part of the
Conveyed Interests, notwithstanding any election to exclude the Environmental
Defect Property by either Party. Subject to Section 6.1(e), with respect to
any Environmental Defect (including the Remediation Amount with respect to
such Environmental Defect) that the Parties' have not agreed upon prior to the
sixth Business Day prior to Closing, the Environmental Defect Property for
said Environmental Defect will be included with the Conveyed 

Interests conveyed to Buyer at Closing and the Purchase Price will be reduced
at Closing by the asserted Remediation Amount (as asserted by Buyer in good
faith as part of an Environmental Defect Notice timely and properly alleged
under Section 6.1(a)) of the Environmental Defect Property affected by such
Environmental Defect; and, provided, further, that the Final Price shall be
adjusted to take into account the resolution of all Disputed Environmental
Matters after Closing (either by agreement of the Parties or as a result of
the determination of the Environmental Arbitrator under Section 6.1(f)), any
Environmental Defects cured by Seller during the Cure Period, and the
application of Section 6.1(e). If, at the time at which the Final Price is
finally determined, the Purchase Price is reduced by the Remediation Amount
for any Environmental Defect (except for Environmental Defect Properties
excluded pursuant to Section (c)(ii) or as set forth above, which will
constitute Excluded Assets and Other Matters) or the Purchase Price is not
reduced for any Environmental Defect as a result of the application of Section
6.1(e), Buyer shall be deemed to have assumed responsibility for all of the
costs and expenses attributable to the Remediation of the Environmental
Condition attributable to such Environmental Defect and for all Liabilities
with respect thereto and Buyer's obligations with respect to the foregoing
shall be deemed to constitute Assumed Obligations; provided that the foregoing
shall not prejudice Buyer's rights under (A) any Environmental Indemnity
Agreement and/or (B) (1) Section 13.2(a) (with respect to a breach by Seller
of Section 7.15), (2) Section 13.2(b) (with respect to a breach by Seller of
Section 9.1), (3) Section 13.2(d)(i) and/or (4) Section 13.2(d)(ii) (in each
case to the limited extent expressly set forth in such Sections).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall
there by any Environmental Defect, and Buyer shall not be permitted to deliver
an Environmental Defect Notice, with respect to (i) any Subject Property
operated by Buyer or its Affiliates, or (ii) any Subject Property in which
Seller owns only an overriding royalty interest, and all Liabilities with
respect to the foregoing (including to the extent relating to the Conveyed
Interests) shall be deemed to constitute Assumed Obligations.

(d) Exclusive Remedy. Except for Buyer's rights (i) to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(e) and (ii) to indemnification pursuant to
(A) Section 13.2(a) (with respect to a breach by Seller of Section 7.15), (B)
Section 13.2(b) (with respect to a breach by Seller of Section 9.1), (C)
Section 13.2(d)(i), and/or (D) Section 13.2(d)(ii) (in each case to the
limited extent expressly set forth in such Sections), the provisions set forth
in Section 6.1(c) shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with
respect to any Environmental Defect, Environmental Condition, or other
environmental matter with respect to any Conveyed Interest.

(e) Environmental Threshold and Deductible. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this
Section 6.1(e), with respect to any Environmental Defect timely and properly
asserted under Section 6.1(a), (i) in no event shall there be any adjustment
to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any
Environmental Defect with respect to an individual Environmental Defect
Property (or Environmental Defects, if more than one Environmental Defect
affects the individual Environmental Defect Property) for which the
Remediation Amount (or aggregate Remediation Amounts, if applicable) does not
exceed $70,000 (the "Individual Environmental Threshold"); and (ii) in no
event shall there be any adjustment to the Purchase Price or other remedies
provided by Seller for any Environmental Defect (or Environmental Defects, if
applicable) affecting an individual Environmental Defect Property for which
the Remediation Amount (or aggregate Remediation 

Amounts, if applicable) exceeds the Individual Environmental Threshold unless
(A) the amount of the sum of (1) the aggregate Remediation Amounts of all such
Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold (as
determined in accordance with (i) above, but excluding any Remediation Amounts
attributable to any Environmental Defects cured by Seller and Conveyed
Interests retained by Seller pursuant to Section (c)) plus (2) (x) the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all Title Defects that exceed the Individual
Title Defect Threshold (as determined in accordance with Section 5.3(i), but
excluding any Title Defect Amounts attributable to Title Defects cured by
Seller) less (y) the aggregate Title Benefit Amount of all Title Benefits,
exceeds (B) the Aggregate Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be
entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other applicable remedies
available hereunder, but only with respect to the amount by which the
aggregate amount of such Remediation Amounts and Title Defect Amounts exceeds
the Aggregate Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt, in the instance an
identical Environmental Defect is present with respect to multiple Subject
Properties, the Remediation Amounts for all such identical Environmental
Defects shall not be aggregated when determining whether the Individual
Environmental Threshold has been satisfied. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Individual Title Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible shall not apply
to any Title Defect timely and properly asserted under Section 5.3(a) with
respect to any of the Leases set forth on Schedule 5.3(i).

(f) Environmental Dispute Resolution. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree
on (i) all Environmental Defects and Remediation Amounts prior to the Dispute
Date and (ii) the adequacy of any cure by Seller of any asserted Environmental
Defect prior to the Dispute Date (items (i) and (ii), collectively, the
"Disputed Environmental Matters"). If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree by
the Dispute Date, the Disputed Environmental Matters shall be exclusively and
finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this Section 6.1(f). There shall
be a single arbitrator, who shall be an environmental attorney with at least
10 years' experience in environmental matters involving oil and gas producing
properties in any of the regional areas in which the affected Conveyed
Interests are located, as selected by the mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller
within 15 days after the Dispute Date (the "Environmental Arbitrator"). If the
Parties do not mutually agree upon the Environmental Arbitrator in accordance
with this Section 6.1(f), the Dallas, Texas office of the AAA shall appoint
such Environmental Arbitrator under such conditions as the AAA in its sole
discretion deems necessary or advisable. The place of arbitration shall be
Dallas, Texas, and the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the
AAA Rules, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this
Section 6.1(f). Each of Buyer and Seller shall submit to the Environmental
Arbitrator, with a simultaneous copy to the other Party, a single written
statement of its position on the Disputed Environmental Matters in question,
together with a copy of this Agreement and any supporting material that such
Party desires to furnish, not later than the 10th Business Day after
appointment of the Environmental Arbitrator. The Environmental Arbitrator's
determination shall be made within 20 days after the end of such 10 Business
Day period after the submission of the Disputed Environmental Matters and
shall be final and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In
making his determination, the Environmental Arbitrator shall make a
determination of the Disputed Environmental Matters submitted based solely on
the single written submission of Seller and Buyer (and without any additional
or supplemental submittals by any Party, except to the extent the
Environmental Arbitrator requests additional information from either Party),
shall be bound by the rules set forth in this Section 6.1 and, subject to the
foregoing, may consider such other legal and industry matters as in the
opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are 

necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. The Environmental
Arbitrator, however, may not award Buyer a greater Remediation Amount than the
Remediation Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Environmental Defect
Notice or a lesser Remediation Amount than the Remediation Amount claimed by
Seller in its applicable position statement delivered to the Environmental
Arbitrator. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the
limited purpose of determining specific Disputed Environmental Matters
submitted by either Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to
either Party with respect to any matter, except as otherwise provided in the
following sentence. The costs of the Environmental Arbitrator (and the AAA, if
applicable) and the reasonable legal costs and expenses incurred by the
Parties in connection with the arbitration shall be borne pro rata between the
Parties with each Party being responsible for such costs and expenses to the
extent the Environmental Arbitrator has not selected such Party's position on
an aggregate dollar basis with respect to all amounts submitted for resolution
by the Environmental Arbitrator.

6.2 NORM, Asbestos, Wastes and Other Substances. Buyer acknowledges that the
Conveyed Interests have been used for exploration, development, and production
of oil and gas and that there may be petroleum, produced water, wastes, or
other substances or materials located in, on or under the Conveyed Interests
or associated with the Conveyed Interests. Equipment and sites included in the
Conveyed Interests may contain asbestos, NORM or other Hazardous Substances.
NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells, materials, and
equipment as scale, or in other forms. The wells, materials, and equipment
located on the Conveyed Interests or included in the Conveyed Interests may
contain asbestos, NORM and other wastes or Hazardous Substances. NORM
containing material and/or other wastes or Hazardous Substances may have come
in contact with various environmental media, including water, soils or
sediment. Special procedures may be required for the assessment, remediation,
removal, transportation, or disposal of any affected environmental media,
wastes, asbestos, NORM and other Hazardous Substances from the Conveyed
Interests. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall not be
permitted to claim any Environmental Defect on the account of the presence of
NORM or asbestos-containing materials that are non-friable, unless and only to
the extent such presence of NORM or asbestos-containing materials that are
non-friable constitutes an Environmental Condition.

Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and therein will not (a)
conflict with or result in a breach of any provisions of the organizational

obligations hereunder; and there has been no settlement of litigation with
Third Parties or order of any Governmental Authority with respect to the
ownership or operation of the Conveyed Interests that would be binding on
Buyer (or adversely affect the Conveyed Interests) after Closing. For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 7.6 (i) does not include any matters with
respect to Environmental Laws or other environmental matters, (ii) the sole
representation and warranty with respect to Environmental Laws or other

normal business hours, to materials in Buyer's or its Affiliates' possession
that have been received from Third Parties after Closing relating to any
indemnity claim made under Section 13.2 for review and copying at Seller's
expense, provided that (i) Buyer will not be required to disclose any
materials subject to the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work-product
doctrine, confidentiality restrictions, or any other applicable immunity from
disclosure, (ii) Buyer's provision to Seller, its Affiliates and their
respective representatives of access to materials under this Section 9.4 shall
not constitute an admission that any such materials are relevant to any given
indemnity claim, (iii) (A) Buyer's inadvertent provision to Seller, its
Affiliates and their respective representatives of access to confidential
materials and/or materials subject to the attorney-client privilege or
attorney work-product doctrine shall not constitute a waiver of the applicable
privilege or protection and (B) upon discovery of the inadvertent disclosure,
Buyer shall retain the right to assert all applicable privileges and
protections and Seller, its Affiliates and their respective representatives
shall be prohibited from using the inadvertently disclosed documents for any
purpose, and (iv) all Records and materials provided under this Section 9.4
shall be treated by Seller, its Affiliates and their respective
representatives as confidential and shall not be disclosed or provided to any
Third-Party without the express written consent of Buyer. At the end of such
two-year period, Buyer shall provide Seller a reasonable opportunity to copy
any or all of such Records at Seller's expense.

9.5 Knowledge of Breach. Buyer will notify Seller, and Seller will notify
Buyer, promptly and in reasonable detail promptly after such Party or any
Affiliate of such Party, obtains Knowledge that any representation, warranty,
covenant, or other agreement of the other Party contained in this Agreement
is, becomes, or will be untrue, or has been or may be breached, as applicable,
in any material respect on or before the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (a) a Party's breach of this Section 9.5 will under no
circumstances be deemed a material breach of this Agreement by such Party or
constitute a failure of any condition in Article X or Article XI and (b) this
Section 9.5 shall not be deemed or constitute a waiver by a Party of (or give
rise to any defense on the part of the other Party to) any rights or remedies
of such Party contained in this Agreement in respect of any breach hereof by
the other Party. No breach by a Party of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or condition of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Agreement for any purpose under this Agreement if the other
Party had Knowledge of such breach prior to the Execution Date.

9.6 Amendment to Schedules. Buyer agrees that, with respect to the
representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement, Seller
shall have the continuing right until Closing to add, supplement or amend the
Schedules to its representations and warranties with respect to any matter
hereafter occurring which, if existing on the Execution Date or thereafter,
would have been required to be set forth or described in such Schedules. For
all purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of determining whether
the conditions set forth in Article X have been fulfilled and whether Seller
has breached its representations and warranties in Article VII, the Schedules
to Seller's representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall
be deemed to include only that information contained therein on the Execution
Date and shall be deemed to exclude all information contained in any addition,
supplement or amendment thereto.

9.7 Employees. From and after the Execution Date until the date that is 12
calendar months after the earlier to occur of (i) the Closing Date and (ii)
the termination of this Agreement 

pursuant to Section 14.1, each Party will not, and will cause its Affiliates
not to, directly or indirectly, solicit (and will not cause any Third Party to
solicit on its behalf) for employment (including by contracting through an
independent contractor, consultant, or other Third Party) or employ (including
as a consultant) any officer, employee, or field personnel of or under
contract to the other Party or any Affiliate of the other Party without
obtaining the prior written consent of Seller, if the first Party came into
contact with such officer, employee or field personnel in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any such officers, employees or
field personnel, a "Subject Employee"); provided that the foregoing shall not
prohibit any Party or its Affiliates from (A) hiring a Subject Employee who
responds to a general solicitation to the public of general advertising or
similar methods of solicitation by search firms not specifically directed at
Subject Employees or (B) soliciting, recruiting or hiring any Subject Employee
who has ceased to be employed or retained by the other Party or any of its
Affiliates for at least six months.

9.8 Suspense Funds. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but
without prejudice to Buyer's rights under Article XIII, Buyer shall, from and
after the termination or expiration of the Transition Services Agreement (or,
if the Transition Services Agreement is not executed at Closing, 60 days after
the Closing Date (the "Suspense Transfer Date")) assume and fulfill, perform,
pay and discharge (or cause to be fulfilled, performed, paid and discharged)
all obligations and Liabilities arising from, based upon, related to or
associated with the payment of all proceeds from sales of Hydrocarbons
relating to the Conveyed Interests and payable to owners of working interests,
royalties, overriding royalties and other similar interests or Burdens (in
each case) that are held by Seller in suspense. Such payments held in suspense
(a) will not be included in the calculation of the adjustments to the Purchase
Price for the Preliminary Settlement Statement and (b) shall be included in
the calculation of the adjustments to the Purchase Price for the Final
Settlement Statement in accordance with Section 3.3(b)(ix). From the Suspense
Transfer Date until the first anniversary thereof, Seller may transfer
additional suspense obligation discovered and/or identified following the
Suspense Transfer Date, together with any suspense funds related thereto, to
Buyer up to two times, and Seller shall have no further right or obligation to
transfer suspense obligations and/or funds unless otherwise agreed by the
Parties.

9.9 Tag-Along Rights. Buyer acknowledges that certain of the Conveyed
Interests are subject to the rights of the Third Parties identified in
Schedule 9.9 (the "Tag Parties") to include certain of their respective
interests in the Subject Properties (such interests, as set forth on Schedule
9.9, the "Tag Interests") as part of the transactions contemplated hereunder
(the "Tag Rights"). Accordingly, no later than 10 days after the Execution
Date, Seller shall send to each Tag Party a notice of, and opportunity to
participate as a seller in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with the contractual provisions governing the Tag Rights and for
the applicable allocated values set forth on Schedule 9.9 for the respective
Tag Interests. If a Tag Party notifies Seller in writing prior to Closing,
and, in any event, before the expiration of its Tag Rights, that it is
exercising its Tag Right with respect to its Tag Interests, this Agreement
shall be amended to include that Tag Party as a seller hereto (each, a "Tag
Seller Party," and, together with Seller, the "Seller Parties") with respect
to those Tag Interests prior to Closing (which Tag Interests shall, upon such
execution and delivery of such amendment, become part of the "Conveyed
Interests"), on the following terms and conditions: 

(a) By its execution of this Agreement and for a period beginning on the date
of such execution and ending 180 days after Closing, each Tag Seller Party
irrevocably authorizes Seller to act on that Tag Seller Party's behalf until
180 days after the Closing with respect to the following matters pertaining to
this Agreement: (i) delivering and receiving all notices, statements, reports,
and other information given by or addressed to one or more of the Seller
Parties hereunder, (ii) making, on a joint basis, all elections that any
Seller Party is entitled to make hereunder, and (iii) negotiating,
compromising, and resolving any matters related to this Agreement, including
Title Defects, Environmental Defects, Casualty Losses, Preferential Purchase
Rights, Consents, the Preliminary Settlement Statement, and the Final
Settlement Statement, and Seller hereby agrees to perform those matters,
subject to the provisions of this Section 9.9 (collectively, the
"Representative Services"); provided, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Representative Services shall not include, and Seller shall not
serve as a Tag Seller Party's representative, or have any obligation to the
Tag Seller Parties, with respect to (A) receiving or disbursing any amounts
due to a Tag Seller Party under this Agreement, (B) any claims asserted by
Buyer against a Tag Seller Party under Section 13.2, (C) any claims asserted
by a Tag Seller Party against Buyer under Section 13.3, (D) any other
indemnity matters, (E) the negotiation, compromise, or resolution of any
matters related to any Claim Notices or other indemnity matters, or (F) any
administrative functions or other actions (such as giving and receiving
notices) related to any Claim Notices or other indemnity matters.

(b) Seller shall have no Liability to the Tag Seller Parties for, and each Tag
Seller Party HEREBY RELEASES Seller from and against, all Liabilities relating
to, arising out of, or resulting in any way from Seller's performance and
discharge, or failure to perform and discharge, the Representative Services,
including any action or decision taken or made by Seller under, pursuant to,
or in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, or
any related agreements in its role as the Tag Seller Parties' representative,
HOWSOEVER ARISING AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH CLAIMS ARISE OUT OF THE NEGLIGENCE
(WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT OR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR
OTHER FAULT OR BREACH OF LEGAL DUTY OF ANY OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES,
except for any such Liabilities that may result from (and only to the extent
it results from) Seller's gross negligence or willful misconduct. EACH TAG
SELLER PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT SELLER IS NOT ACTING IN ANY
FIDUCIARY CAPACITY WHATSOEVER FOR OR ON BEHALF OF THAT TAG SELLER PARTY WITH
RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE, AND THAT SELLER'S AGREEMENT TO PERFORM
THE MATTERS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS SECTION 9.9 FOR THE TAG SELLER PARTIES IS
MADE AS AN ACCOMMODATION ONLY.

(c) Each Tag Seller Party, by the execution of this Agreement, expressly
acknowledges and agrees that Buyer shall be entitled to rely on any and all
actions and decisions taken or made by Seller under or pursuant to this
Agreement that are within the scope of Seller's authority under Section 9.9(a)
without any liability to, or obligation to inquire of, such Tag Seller Party.
Any notice or communication given or received by, and any decision, action,
failure to act within a designated period of time by, or instruction of,
Seller that is within the scope of Seller's authority under Section 9.9(a)
shall constitute a notice or communication to or by all Seller Parties and
shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon each Tag Seller Party. SELLER
WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS, AND EACH TAG SELLER PARTY RELEASES, EACH
BUYER 

INDEMNIFIED PARTY FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES IN FAVOR OF ANY
SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY ARISING OUT OF, OR RESULTING IN ANY WAY FROM, THE
PERFORMANCE AND DISCHARGE, OR THE FAILURE TO PERFORM OR DISCHARGE, BY SELLER
OF THE REPRESENTATIVE SERVICES.

(d) If any Seller Party has not satisfied the conditions to Closing set forth
in Article X (as such conditions relate to such Seller Party), Buyer will have
the right, if so desired, to not close the transactions contemplated hereunder
as to such Seller Party and to close the transactions contemplated hereunder
as to the other Seller Parties; provided, that, (i) notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the conditions to Closing set forth in Article X are satisfied
as they relate to Seller, but have not been satisfied as to a Tag Seller
Party, Buyer will still be required to close the transactions contemplated
hereunder (subject to the other terms and conditions hereof) as to the
Conveyed Interests of Seller and (ii) if the conditions to Closing set forth
in Article X are not satisfied as they relate to Seller, but have been
satisfied as to any or all of the Tag Seller Parties, Buyer will not be
required to close any of the transactions contemplated hereunder (subject to
the other terms and conditions hereof).

(e) All thresholds, deductibles, caps, and similar limitations herein shall be
reduced, and apply separately, for each Tag Seller Party, on a pro rata basis
determined by dividing the relevant Tag Interest by the relevant Conveyed
Interests. Further, the benefit or burden of any adjustment to the Purchase
Price, to the extent applicable to two or more of the Seller Parties, shall be
allocated among those Seller Parties on the same pro rata basis referenced in
the preceding sentence.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Liabilities of the Seller Parties under this Agreement shall be shared
severally, and not jointly, by each Seller Party.

The Parties' failure to agree on the above-mentioned amendment will not
constitute a failure of any condition in Article X and Article XI.

9.10 Transition Services Agreement. Between the Execution Date and the Closing
Date, the Parties will use commercially reasonably efforts to negotiate a form
of transition services agreement (the "Transition Services Agreement") to be
executed at Closing by the Parties, establishing the terms under which Seller
would provide certain transition services (at a minimum, operations,
accounting, information technology and marketing services) in respect of the
Conveyed Interests for a limited period of time following the Closing. If the
Parties do not reach an agreement regarding such a Transition Services
Agreement, the Closing shall nonetheless occur (subject to the other terms of
this Agreement) and, thereafter, for a period of 60 days following the
Closing, Seller shall provide transition services pursuant to (and subject to
the limitations set forth in) the term sheet set forth on Exhibit L in
substantially the same manner as Seller or its Affiliates performed such
services during the one-year period immediately prior to the Execution Date
and Buyer agrees to be bound by the release and indemnification terms set
forth therein with respect to such transition services. 



9.11 Audits and Filings.

(a) Seller acknowledges that Buyer and its Affiliates may be required to
include statements of revenues and direct operating expenses and other
financial information relating to the Conveyed Interests for one or more years
or interim periods ending on or prior to the Closing (collectively, the
"Financial Statements"), and that such Financial Statements may be required to
be audited or reviewed in accordance with GAAP and may need to comply with the
requirements of the SEC for inclusion or incorporation by reference into one
or more registration statements, reports or other documents (collectively,
"SEC Documents") required to be filed by Buyer or its Affiliates under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules set forth
in Regulation S-X, or other rules promulgated thereunder or in an offering
memorandum relating to a private placement of securities exempt from
registration under the Securities Act ("Offering Document"). From and after
the Execution Date, Seller shall, shall cause its Affiliates to, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its accountants and counsel to,
cooperate with Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective agents, advisors and
representatives in preparing and obtaining the Financial Statements to the
extent that Seller or such other persons has such information available or can
obtain such information using commercially reasonable efforts. Further, from
and after the Execution Date and following reasonable advance notice from
Buyer to Seller, Seller shall, shall cause its Affiliates to, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its accountants and counsel to, make
available during normal business hours to Buyer and its Affiliates and their
agents, advisors and representatives reasonable access to any and all books,
records, information and documents that are attributable to the Conveyed
Interests in any of Seller's or any of its Affiliates' possession or control
if reasonably required by Buyer or its Affiliates in connection with the
creation and audit or review of the Financial Statements. Buyer shall be
responsible for, and obligated to promptly reimburse Seller for (in any event,
not less than within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of demand in writing
therefor), any and all reasonable costs and expenses (including third person
or internal resources and personnel) incurred by Seller or its Affiliates to
the extent associated with preparing and obtaining the Financial Statements
solely pursuant to this Section 9.11 and otherwise complying with the
provisions of this Section 9.11.

(b) To the extent requested by Buyer, Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain representation letters and similar documents (in
each case, in form and substance customary for representation letters provided
to external audit firms by management of a company whose financial statements
are the subject of an audit or review used in filings of acquired company
financial statements under the Exchange Act) from applicable personnel of
Seller and its Affiliates as may be required in connection with the
preparation and audit or review of the Financial Statements or delivery of a
"comfort letter" for a securities offering by Buyer or its Affiliates and
solely to the extent related to the Conveyed Interests. To the extent
requested by Buyer, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
provide and request that each independent audit firm that audits or reviews
the Financial Statements provide consents necessary for the inclusion or
incorporation by reference of the Financial Statements in any SEC Document or
any Offering Document in which the Financial Statements are required to be
included or incorporated. 

(c) Subject and without prejudice to Buyer's rights hereunder with respect to
Seller's representation and warranties in Article VII (to the limited extent
expressly set forth therein), all of the information provided by Seller or its
Affiliates pursuant to this Section 9.11 is given without any representation
or warranty, express or implied, and no Seller Indemnified Party shall have
any liability or responsibility with respect thereto. Without prejudice to
Buyer's rights and remedies under Article XIII and, if applicable, Section
14.1(d) (and except for and excluding any of the following to the extent
arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Seller
Indemnified Party), Buyer, for itself and for each member of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, hereby releases, defends, indemnifies, remises and
forever discharges each member of the Seller Indemnified Parties from any and
all suits, legal or administrative proceedings, claims, demands, damages,
losses, costs, Liabilities, interest or causes of action whatsoever, at law or
in equity, known or unknown, suffered or incurred by any Seller Indemnified
Party based on, relating to or arising out of the information provided by
Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to this Section 9.11.

(d) For a period of three years following the Closing Date, Seller shall, and
shall cause its respective Affiliates to, retain all books, records,
information and documents in their or their Affiliates' possession that are
necessary to prepare and audit the Financial Statements, except to the extent
originals or copies thereof are transferred to Buyer in connection with
Closing.

9.12 Buyer Financing.

(a) None of the Financing Sources will have any liability to any Seller
Indemnified Party relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Financing
or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort, or otherwise,
and none of the Seller Indemnified Parties will have any rights or claims (and
will not bring or support any claims) against any of the Financing Sources
hereunder or thereunder in connection with the transactions contemplated,
whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort, or otherwise. Each Party
agrees that (i) it will not, and will not permit its controlled Affiliates to,
bring or support any action, claim, cause of action or similar claims or
assertions of any kind or description, whether at law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including with respect to any dispute arising out of or relating in
any way to the Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or any
court of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City
of New York and (ii) any such action, claim, cause of action or similar claims
or assertions will be instituted exclusively in the courts of the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York or any court of
the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New
York and each Party hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction
and venue in connection with any such action, claim, cause of action or
similar claims or assertions. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY VOLUNTARILY AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING
BROUGHT IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ACTION, CLAIM, CAUSE OF ACTION OR SIMILAR
CLAIMS OR ASSERTIONS OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION REFERRED TO IN THIS SECTION
9.12(a). EACH OF THE PARTIES AGREES THAT, SECTION 15.14 NOTWITHSTANDING, THIS
SECTION 9.12(A) SHALL BE INTERPRETED, AND ANY 

ACTION RELATING TO THIS PROVISION, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE
OF NEW YORK.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to provide or cause to be
provided, to Buyer, in each case, at Buyer's sole expense, all cooperation
reasonably requested by Buyer that is necessary or customary in connection
with any Financing contemplated by Buyer for purposes of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. None of Seller or its Affiliates shall be
required to take any action pursuant to this Section 9.12(b) that would
subject it to any Liability or to bear any cost or expense or to pay any
commitment or other fee. BUYER SHALL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE SELLER
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES SUFFERED OR
INCURRED BY THEM IN CONNECTION WITH THE ARRANGEMENT OF SUCH FINANCING
(INCLUDING ANY ACTION TAKEN AT BUYER'S REQUEST PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION
9.12(b)) AND ANY INFORMATION UTILIZED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, EXCEPT TO THE
EXTENT CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE SELLER
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES. Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall promptly
reimburse Seller upon written request by Seller for, any and all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by Seller or its Affiliates in connection with the
Financing or the cooperation provided at Buyer's request pursuant to this
Section 9.12(b).

exceed the Allocated Value thereof); provided, however, that for the avoidance
of doubt, any matter that constitutes a Title Defect or Environmental Defect
(other than an Environmental Defect that constitutes a breach of Section 7.15)
hereunder (regardless whether Buyer asserts such matter as a Title Defect or
Environmental Defect) shall be addressed exclusively under Article V, Article 

VI, and, if applicable Section 14.1(e), and not be considered in determining
whether this Section 10.1 is fulfilled.

specified dollar amount will be read without regard and without giving effect
to such qualifier.

(iii) In no event shall Seller be responsible or liable for any breach of a
representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement or any
Transaction Document, to the extent such breach resulted from Buyer's or any
of its Affiliates' ownership or operation of any of the Subject Properties,
and all Liabilities relating to such matters (including to the extent relating
to the Conveyed Interests) shall be deemed Assumed Obligations.

(iv) No event occurring prior to, or any condition in existence as of, the
Execution Date that constitutes an Environmental Defect, Environmental

respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, including breaches of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Parties contained
in this Agreement, the Assignment, or in any document or certificate delivered

the Parties, the Transaction Documents, and the Special Warranty in the
Assignment, effective as of Closing, Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of

the other Party and its Affiliates and all of such Persons' equity holders,

damages, common law rights of contribution and rights under insurance
maintained by a Party or any of its Affiliates (except as provided in Section
5.4 or insurance of Seller or its Affiliates which was chargeable as an
Operating Expense after the Effective Time). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING,
THE RIGHTS EXISTING IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE EXECUTION DATE (WHETHER EXISTING
BY OPERATION OF LAW, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE), OF EACH PARTY AS A NON-OPERATOR
IN ANY SUBJECT PROPERTIES OPERATED BY THE OTHER PARTY, OR AS ANY OPERATOR OF
ANY SUBJECT PROPERTIES IN WHICH THE OTHER PARTY IS A NON-OPERATOR, SHALL NOT
BE PREJUDICED OR OTHERWISE AFFECTED BY THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT (OTHER
THAN (a) TITLE DEFECTS OR OTHER 

TITLE MATTERS, WHICH FOLLOWING CLOSING SHALL BE EXCLUSIVELY ADDRESSED AS SET
FORTH IN SECTION 5.1 AND (b) ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECTS, ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS,
OR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, WHICH FOLLOWING CLOSING SHALL BE EXCLUSIVELY
ADDRESSED HEREIN IN ARTICLE VI, AND, AS APPLICABLE, SECTIONS 13.2(a) (WITH
RESPECT TO A BREACH OF SECTION 7.15), 13.2(b) (WITH RESPECT TO A BREACH OF
SECTION 9.1), 13.2(d) AND 13.3).

13.7 Indemnification Procedures. All claims for indemnification hereunder,
including Sections 4.1(c), 5.3(c), 9.3, 9.9, 9.10 (if a Transition Services
Agreement is not executed at Closing), 13.2 and 13.3 (for purposes of this
Section 13.7, the "indemnification provisions") shall be asserted and resolved
as follows:

(a) For purposes of the indemnification provisions, the term "Indemnifying
Party" when used in connection with particular Liabilities shall mean the
Party or Parties having an obligation to indemnify another Party and/or other
Person(s) with respect to such Liabilities pursuant to the indemnification
provisions, and the term "Indemnified Party" when used in connection with
particular Liabilities shall mean the Party and/or other Person(s) having the
right to be indemnified with respect to such Liabilities by the Indemnifying
Party pursuant to the indemnification provisions.

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under the indemnification provisions,
an Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of its
claim under this Section 13.7, including the specific details of and specific
basis under this Agreement for its claim as then known by the Indemnified
Party (the "Claim Notice"). In the event that the claim for indemnification is
based upon a claim by a Third Party against the Indemnified Party (a "Third
Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall provide its Claim Notice promptly
after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Third Party Claim and
shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Third
Party Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice
of a Third Party Claim as provided in this Section 13.7(b) shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under the indemnification provisions
(as applicable) except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time
being available to permit the Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against
the Third Party Claim or otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying
Party's ability to defend against the Third Party Claim. In the event that the
claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall
specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was
inaccurate or breached.

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice
to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its obligation to
defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is
authorized, prior to and during such 30‑day period, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall
deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the
Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its obligation to defend and indemnify
the Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, it shall have the right and
obligation to diligently defend and indemnify, at its sole cost and expense,
the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party
shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any
compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate in contesting any Third Party Claim
which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The Indemnified Party may
participate in, but not control, with its own counsel and at its own expense,
any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 13.7(d). An Indemnifying Party
shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle
any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
thereto which does not include a full and unconditional written release of the
Indemnified Party from all Liability in respect of such Third Party Claim
without any admission or finding of fault or liability on the part of the
Indemnified Party or (ii) settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry
of any judgment with respect thereto in any manner that may materially and
adversely affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money
damages fully paid by the Indemnifying Party).

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its obligation or admits its
obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party against a Third Party
Claim, but fails to diligently prosecute, indemnify against or settle such
Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend
against the Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party, with counsel of the Indemnified Party's choosing. The Indemnifying
Party may participate in, but not control, with its own counsel and at its own
expense, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 13.7(e). If the Indemnifying Party
has not yet admitted its obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnified
Party against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall send written
notice to the Indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement and the
Indemnifying Party shall have the option for 10 days following receipt of such
notice to %3) admit in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified
Party from and against the liability and consent to such settlement, %3) if
liability is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed
settlement, or %3) deny liability. Any failure by the Indemnifying Party to
respond to such notice shall be deemed to be an election under subsection
(iii) above.

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to (i) cure the Liabilities complained of, (ii) admit its liability for
such Liability or (iii) dispute the claim for such Liabilities. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within such 30‑day
period that it has cured the Liabilities or that it disputes the claim for
such Liabilities, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to dispute the claim
for such Liabilities.

(g) The indemnification provisions in this Section 13.7 will apply mutatis
mutandis to any indemnity obligations hereunder of the Parties that are not
referenced in Section 13.7(a). 

13.8 Survival.

(a) Except for the Specified Representations, (i) the representations and
warranties of Seller in Article VII, (ii) the covenants and agreements of the
Parties in Section 9.1 and Section 12.4, and (iii) any other covenants and
agreements of the Parties that are to be performed on or before the Closing
shall survive the Closing and in each case terminate on the date that is 12
calendar months following the Closing Date. The Specified Representations and
the covenants set forth in Section 15.2 shall survive Closing until the
expiration of 30 days after the applicable statute of limitations. The Special
Warranty shall terminate as of the expiration of the Survival Period. Subject
to the foregoing and as set forth in Section 13.8(b), the remainder of this
Agreement shall survive Closing without time limit. Representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements shall be of no further force or effect
after the date of their expiration, provided that there shall be no
termination of any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement prior to its
expiration date.

(b) The indemnities in Sections 13.2(a), 13.2(b), 13.3(a) and 13.3(b) shall
terminate as of the expiration date of each respective representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement that is subject to indemnification. Seller's
indemnities set forth in Section 13.2(c) (i) with respect to Operating
Expenses that constitute Specified Obligations under subsection (vi) of the
Specified Obligations, shall terminate 24 calendar months after Closing and
(ii) with respect to all other Specified Obligations, shall terminate on the
earlier of the (A) the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and
(B) 48 calendar months after Closing. Seller's indemnity set forth in Section
13.2(d)(ii) shall terminate on the earlier of the (1) the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations and (2) 48 calendar months after Closing.
Buyer's indemnity set forth in Sections 4.1(c), 9.3, 9.10 (if the Transition
Services Agreement is not executed at Closing), and 13.3(c), and Seller's
indemnity set forth in Section 13.2(d)(i), shall survive the Closing without
time limit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no termination of
any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to the indemnities in Sections 13.2(a)
through 13.2(c), Section 13.2(d)(ii) or Sections 13.3(a) through 13.3(b) prior
to the date of termination for such indemnity.

13.9 Non‑Compensatory Damages. None of the Buyer Indemnified Parties nor
Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover from Seller or Buyer,
or their respective Affiliates, any special, indirect, consequential,
punitive, exemplary, remote or speculative damages or damages for lost profits
of any kind arising under or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent any such Party suffers
such damages to a Third Party, which damages (including costs of defense and
reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with defending against such
damages) shall not be excluded by this provision as to recovery hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, Buyer, on behalf of each of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, and Seller, on behalf of each of the Seller Indemnified
Parties, waive any right to recover special, indirect, consequential,
punitive, exemplary, remote or speculative, or damages for lost profits of any
kind, arising in connection with or with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

13.10 Waiver of Right to Rescission. Seller and Buyer acknowledge that,
following Closing, the payment of money or specific performance (with respect
the performance of covenants 

or agreements herein following Closing), in each case, as may be limited by
the terms of this Agreement, shall be adequate compensation for breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein or for any
other claim arising in connection with or with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. As the payment of money or specific
performance (with respect the performance of covenants or agreements herein
following Closing) shall be adequate compensation, following Closing, Buyer
and Seller waive any right to rescind this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

13.11 Insurance. The amount of any Liabilities for which any of the Seller
Indemnified Parties or the Buyer Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, is
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement or in connection with or with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (for purposes of
this Section 13.11, the "indemnified party") shall be reduced by any
corresponding insurance proceeds from insurance policies carried by the
indemnified party that are realized by the indemnified party.

13.12 Disclaimer of Application of Anti-Indemnity Statutes. THE PARTIES
ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE PROVISIONS OF ANY ANTI-INDEMNITY STATUTE
RELATING TO OILFIELD SERVICES AND ASSOCIATED ACTIVITIES SHALL NOT BE
APPLICABLE TO THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.


ARTICLE XIV

TERMINATION, DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

14.1 Right of Termination. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein may be terminated at any time prior to Closing by delivery of written
notice to the other Party:

(a) by the mutual prior written consent of Seller and Buyer;

(b) by either Seller or Buyer if Closing has not occurred on or before
December 31, 2017 (or such later date as agreed to in writing by Seller and
Buyer);

(c) by Seller, at Seller's option, if any of the conditions set forth in
Article XI have not been (or cannot be) satisfied on or before the Scheduled
Closing Date and, following written notice thereof from Seller to Buyer
specifying the reason such condition is (or will be) unsatisfied (including
any breach by Buyer of this Agreement), such condition remains unsatisfied for
a period of 10 Business Days after Buyer's receipt of written notice thereof
from Seller;

(d) by Buyer, at Buyer's option, if any of the conditions set forth in Article
X have not been (or cannot be) satisfied on or before the Scheduled Closing
Date and, following written notice thereof from Buyer to Seller specifying the
reason such condition is (or will be) unsatisfied (including any breach by
Seller of this Agreement), such condition remains unsatisfied for a period of
10 Business Days after Seller's receipt of written notice thereof from Buyer; 

(e) by Buyer if the condition set forth in Section 10.4 is not satisfied on or
before the Scheduled Closing Date or by Seller if the condition set forth in
Section 11.4 is not satisfied on the Scheduled Closing Date; or

(f) by Seller if Buyer fails to pay the Deposit in accordance with Section
3.2;

provided, however, that (i) neither Party shall be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Sections 14.1(b) through 14.1(e) above if such Party or
its Affiliates are, at such time, in material breach of any provision of this
Agreement and, (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Parties'
failure to agree on the amendment referenced in Section 9.9 and/or the
Transition Services Agreement during the Interim Period pursuant to Section
9.10 will not be deemed a material breach of this Agreement or constitute a
failure of any condition in Article X or Article XI. For the avoidance of
doubt, any breach of Section 8.8 shall be deemed a material breach of this
Agreement by Buyer.

14.2 Effect of Termination.

(a) If the obligation to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to any provision of Section 14.1 hereof, then, except
for the provisions of Article I, Sections 4.1(c) through 4.1(g), 4.2, 4.3,
5.3(c) (as to the indemnity therein), 6.1(b) (as to the indemnity therein),
9.7, 9.9(b), 9.9(c), 9.11(c), 9.12(a), 13.9, this Section 14.2, Section 14.3,
Article XV (other than Sections 15.2(b) through (e), 15.7, 15.8, 15.16, and
15.18) and such of the defined terms in Appendix I to give context to the
surviving provisions, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and the
Parties shall have no liability or obligation hereunder.

(b) If Seller has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
14.1(c) because a condition set forth in Sections 11.1, 11.2 or 11.5 has not
been satisfied, (A) all of the conditions in Article X (excluding conditions
that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing) have been
satisfied (or waived by Buyer) (unless the failure to satisfy such condition
arises from the action or inaction by Buyer or any Buyer Indemnified Party),
and (B) Seller is ready, willing and able to perform its obligations under
Section 12.3, then, in such event, Seller shall have the right to, at its
option, (1) as Seller's sole and exclusive remedy, terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 14.1(c) and receive the Deposit from the Escrow Agent as
liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, for such termination, free and clear
of any claims thereon by Buyer, or (2) in lieu of terminating this Agreement,
seek all remedies available at law or in equity, including specific
performance by Buyer. The provision for payment of the Deposit as liquidated
damages in this Section 14.2 has been included because, in the event of a
termination of this Agreement permitting Seller to receive the Deposit, the
actual damages to be incurred by Seller can reasonably be expected to
approximate the amount of liquidated damages called for herein and because the
actual amount of such damages would be difficult if not impossible to measure
accurately.

(c) If Buyer has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
14.1(d) because a condition set forth in Sections 10.1, 10.2 or 10.5 has not
been satisfied, (A) all of the conditions in Article XI (excluding conditions
that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing) have been
satisfied (or waived by Seller) (unless the failure to satisfy such condition
arises from the action or inaction by Seller or any Seller Indemnified Party),
and (B) Buyer is ready, willing and able to perform its obligations under
Section 12.3, then, in such event, Buyer shall have the 

right to, at its option, (1) terminate this Agreement, receive the Deposit
from the Escrow Agent, and seek actual damages (incurred by Buyer) against
Seller as a result of Seller's breach of its covenants, agreements,
representations or warranties (as the case may be) hereunder or (2) in lieu of
terminating this Agreement, seek all remedies available at law or in equity,
including specific performance.

(d) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 14.1 for any reason
(other than as set forth in Section 14.2(b), Section 14.2(c) or the following
proviso), neither Buyer nor Seller shall have any liability or obligation to
the other Party in connection with the termination of this Agreement, and the
Parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to return the Deposit to Buyer (free
and clear of any claims thereon by Seller) within five Business Days of the
termination date; provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated by
Seller pursuant to Section 14.1(f), Seller shall have the right to seek actual
damages (incurred by Seller) against Buyer as a result of Buyer's breach of
Section 3.2. If a Party is otherwise entitled to the Deposit under this
Section 14.2, the Parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release the
Deposit to the applicable Party within five Business Days of the termination
date.

14.3 Return of Documentation and Confidentiality. Upon termination of this
Agreement, Buyer shall destroy or return to Seller all title, engineering,
geological and geophysical data, environmental assessments and/or reports,
maps and other information furnished by or on behalf of Seller to Buyer or
prepared by or on behalf of Buyer in connection with its due diligence

the Party incurring the same, including legal and accounting fees, costs and
expenses.

(b) Seller shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes for any period or

in which the severance or production giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred,
(ii) Asset Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts or

clause (i) or (iii)), shall be allocated to the period in which the
transaction giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, and (iii) Asset Taxes
that are ad valorem, property or other Asset Taxes imposed on a periodic basis
pertaining to a Straddle Period shall be allocated between the portion of such
Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time and the portion
of such Straddle Period beginning at the Effective Time by prorating each such
Asset Tax based on the number of days in the applicable Straddle Period that
occur before the date on which the Effective Time occurs, on the one hand, and
the number of days in such Straddle Period that occur on or after the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, on the other hand. For purposes of clause
(iii) of the preceding sentence, the period for such Asset Taxes shall being
on the date on which ownership of the applicable Conveyed Interests gives rise
to liability for the particular Asset Tax and shall end on the day before the
next such date. To the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax is not known
at the time an adjustment is to be made with respect to such Asset Tax
pursuant to Section 3.3, the Parties shall utilize the most recent information
available in estimating the amount of such Asset Tax for purposes of such
adjustment. To the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax is ultimately
determined to be different than the amount (if any) that was taken into
account in the Final Settlement Statement as finally determined pursuant to
Section 3.6, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer for any excess of
actual amount of an Asset Tax over such estimate, and Buyer shall indemnify
and hold harmless Seller for any excess of such estimate over the actual
amount of Asset Tax, in each case taking into account the amount of such Asset
Tax that is allocable to such Party under Section 15.2(b) and this Section
15.2(c). Subject to the Transition Services Agreement (if applicable), Buyer
shall be responsible for the preparation and timely filing of any Tax Returns
with respect to Asset Taxes for Tax periods beginning at or after the
Effective Time that are required to be filed on or after the Closing Date, and
the payment to the applicable Taxing Authority of all Asset Taxes for such Tax
periods that become due and payable on or after the Closing Date, and Buyer
shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless for any failure to file such Tax
Returns and to make such payments subject to Buyer's right of reimbursement
for any Asset Taxes for which Seller is responsible pursuant to Section
15.2(b) and this Section 15.2(c). Notwithstanding the foregoing regarding
filing and payment, Seller shall be responsible for the preparation and timely
filing of any Tax Return and the payment to the applicable Taxing Authority of
any ad valorem or property taxes on Seller operated Subject Properties which
are due and payable within the calendar year 2017, with the prior written
consent of Buyer (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and
subject to each Party's right of reimbursement for any such taxes for which
Seller is responsible pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that
Buyer will be deemed to have given prior written consent in any case where the
actual ad valorem or property taxes which are due and payable are not
materially different from those provided in the Preliminary Settlement
Statement, as agreed on by the Parties pursuant to Section 3.5.

(d) All required documentary, filing and recording fees and expenses in
connection with the filing and recording of the assignments, conveyances or
other instruments required to convey title to the Conveyed Interests to Buyer
shall be borne by Buyer. Any and all sales, use, transfer, stamp, documentary,
registration or similar Taxes incurred or imposed with 

respect to the transactions described in this Agreement (collectively,
"Transfer Taxes") shall be borne by Buyer; provided that Seller shall pay or
cause to be paid to the applicable Governmental Authorities any Transfer Taxes
that it is required by Law to collect and remit. Buyer shall indemnify and
hold Seller harmless from and against such Transfer Taxes within 30 days of
Seller's written demand therefor. If Seller (not Buyer) is required by
applicable Law to appeal or protest the assessment of Transfer Taxes, the
appeal or protest of such proposed assessment shall be treated as an item for
which Seller is entitled to indemnification and if Buyer provides a written
request and instructs Seller to do so, Seller shall prosecute the protest or
appeal; in such event Buyer shall pay all out-of-pocket expenses of Seller
(including attorneys' fees) incurred by Seller in connection with such appeal
or protest. Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to
minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any
such Transfer Taxes.

(e) The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and
any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes relating to
the Conveyed Interests. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
another Party's request) the provision of records and information that are
relevant to any such Tax Return or audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided under this
Agreement. The Parties agree to retain all books and records with respect to
Tax matters pertinent to the Conveyed Interests relating to any Tax period
beginning before the Closing Date until the later of (i) seven years or (ii)
sixty days following the expiration of the statute of limitations of the
respective Tax periods and to abide by all record retention agreements entered
into with any Governmental Authority.

15.3 Assignment. Subject to the provisions of Section 15.18, this Agreement
may not be assigned by either Party without the prior written consent of the
other Party. In the event a Party consents to any such assignment, such
assignment shall not relieve the assigning Party of any obligations and
responsibilities hereunder, including obligations and responsibilities arising
following such assignment. Any assignment or other transfer by Buyer or its
successors and assigns of any of the Conveyed Interests shall not relieve
Buyer or its successors or assigns of any of their obligations (including
indemnity obligations) hereunder, as to the Conveyed Interests so assigned or
transferred.

15.4 Preparation of Agreement. Both Seller and Buyer and their respective
counsel participated in the preparation of this Agreement. In the event of any
ambiguity in this Agreement, no presumption shall arise based on the identity
of the draftsman of this Agreement.

regard to all press releases or other public or private announcements issued

contemplated herein, and, except as may be required by applicable Laws or the
applicable rules and regulations of any Governmental Authority or stock
exchange or as described in the remaining provisions of this Section 15.5,
neither Buyer nor Seller shall issue any such press release or other public or
private announcement without the prior written consent of the other Party
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). The
Parties shall be obligated to hold all specific terms and provisions of this
Agreement strictly

disclosures shall be made only to the extent required thereunder, (b) prevent

accommodation titleholder (as that term is defined in Internal Revenue Service
Revenue Procedure 2000‑37) to effect an Exchange. In connection with any such
Exchange, any exchange accommodation titleholder shall have taken all steps
necessary to own the Conveyed Interests under applicable Law. Each Party

this Agreement nor any other actions taken by a Party or any other Person in
connection with the Exchange shall release either Party from, or modify, any
of its liabilities and obligations (including indemnity obligations to the
other Party) under this Agreement, and neither Party makes any representations
as to any particular Tax treatment that may be afforded to any other Party by
reason of such assignment or any other actions taken in connection with the
Exchange. Either Party electing to treat the acquisition or sale of the
Conveyed Interests as an Exchange shall be obligated to pay all additional
costs incurred hereunder as a result of the Exchange, and in consideration for
the cooperation of the other Party, the Party electing Exchange treatment
shall agree to pay all costs associated with the Exchange and to indemnify and
hold the other Party, its Affiliates, and their respective former, current and
future partners, members, shareholders, owners, officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any and all
liabilities and Taxes arising out of, based upon, attributable to or resulting
from the Exchange or transactions or actions taken in connection with the
Exchange that would not have been incurred by the other Party but for the
electing Party's Exchange election.

15.19 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that if any of the provisions of
this Agreement are not performed by a Party in accordance with their specific
terms, the other Party shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms
hereof, in addition to any other remedy available at law or in equity;
provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, if this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Article XIV, a Party may not thereafter seek or otherwise attempt
to enforce specific performance of the closing of the transactions
contemplated hereby.
