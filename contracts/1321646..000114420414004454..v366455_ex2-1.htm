constitute shareholder approval of such Parent New York Plan and the issuance
or delivery of UK Holdco Common Stock by UK Holdco under the share
limitations set forth thereunder for purposes of Section 422(b) of the Code.

Competition Agreements_ ").

delivering or causing to be delivered to each holder of New York Common Stock
the shares of UK Holdco Common Stock that such holder shall become entitled
to receive with respect to such holder's shares of New York Common Stock

addition, New York and/or UK Holdco shall make available by depositing (or
causing to be deposited) with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to
time after the Effective Time, any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Section 1.3(b)(viii).

(ii) Prior to the Effective Time, New York shall deposit or, after
the Effective Time, at the direction of UK Holdco there shall be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent, from time to time, that number of shares
of UK Holdco Common Stock as are deliverable pursuant to Section 1.3(a), and
which, unless UK Holdco shall otherwise determine, shall be deposited with the
Exchange Agent through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company ("
_DTC_ ").

  



  

(iii) Except as New York shall otherwise determine, all shares of UK
Holdco Common Stock deliverable in respect of shares of New York Common Stock
held of record, other than such shares held of record by Cede and Co., as
nominee for DTC, shall not be delivered to such holders of record directly,
but shall be delivered instead to a bank or trust company selected by New York
that is a participant in the facilities of DTC (the " _Custodian_ "), which
Custodian shall initially hold such shares for the benefit of such holders.

  



  

(iv) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, of shares of New York Common Stock that are represented by
book entry (" _Book Entry Shares_ ") or represented by certificates ("
_Certificates_ "), a form of letter of transmittal, which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Book Entry Shares
or Certificates held by such holder representing such shares of New
York Common Stock shall pass, only upon actual and proper delivery of Book
Entry Shares or Certificates to the Exchange Agent.

  



  

(v) Each holder of shares of New York Common Stock that are
represented by Book Entry Shares or Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange for such holder's shares of New York Common Stock that
are represented by Book Entry Shares or Certificates, upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Book Entry Share or Certificate, together with a letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the number of shares of UK Holdco Common Stock deliverable
in respect of such holder's shares of New York Common Stock represented by
such holder's properly surrendered Book Entry Shares or Certificates in
accordance with Section 1.3(a) and any cash dividends or other distributions
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.3(b)(viii),
and Book Entry Shares or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled, and UK Holdco's register of members shall be updated accordingly.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any unpaid dividends and distributions
payable to holders of shares of New York Common Stock.

(vi) If delivery of shares of UK Holdco Common Stock in respect of
shares of New York Common Stock represented by a Book Entry Share
or Certificate is directed by the person in whose name the surrendered Book
Entry Share or Certificate is registered to be made to a person other than
the person in whose name the surrendered Book Entry Share or Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition of delivery that the Book Entry Share or
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment or
delivery shall have paid to the Exchange Agent any transfer and other taxes
required by reason of the delivery of the shares of UK Holdco to a person
other than the registered holder of the Book Entry Share or Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until so
surrendered, each Book Entry Share and Certificate shall, after the Effective
Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive upon such
surrender the applicable shares of UK Holdco and any dividends or other
distributions as contemplated by this Section 1.3 but shall not entitle its
holder or any other person to any rights as a stockholder of UK Holdco or New
York.

  



  

(vii) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of New York shall
be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
of shares of New York Common Stock that were outstanding prior to the
Effective Time. After the Effective Time, Book Entry Shares and Certificates
presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer shall be canceled and
exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this Section 1.3. The shares of UK Holdco Common
Stock and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section
1.3(b)(viii) issued and paid upon the surrender for exchange of Book Entry
Shares and Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article I shall
be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of New York Common Stock formerly represented by such
Book Entry Shares and Certificates.

  



  

(viii) No dividends or other distributions with respect to UK Holdco
Common Stock deliverable with respect to the shares of New York Common Stock
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Book Entry Shares or
Certificates until after those Book Entry Shares or Certificates are
surrendered as provided in this Section 1.3. After surrender, there shall be
delivered and/or paid to the holder of the UK Holdco Common Stock delivered
in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of surrender, the
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to those shares of UK
Holdco Common Stock with a record date on or after the date of the Effective
Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of this surrender and not
previously paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to those shares of UK Holdco Common
Stock with a record date on or after the date of the Effective Time but with
a payment date subsequent to surrender.

(ix) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the holder's compliance with the replacement requirements
established by the Exchange Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by the
holder of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to the Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall
deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable shares of UK Holdco Common Stock deliverable in respect of the
shares of New York Common Stock represented by the Certificate pursuant to
this Section 1.3.

  



  

(x) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any former holder of
shares of New York Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement any amounts as may
be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of this
payment under the Code, as amended, or under any provision of state, local or
foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate taxing authority, the Surviving Corporation shall be treated
as though it withheld an appropriate amount of the type of
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former
holder of shares of New York Common Stock, sold this consideration for an
amount of cash equal to the fair market value of the consideration at the time
of the deemed sale and paid these cash proceeds to the appropriate taxing
authority.

  



  

(xi) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash deposited by New York
and/or UK Holdco for the purposes of paying dividends or other
distributions pursuant to Section 1.3(b)(viii), pending its disbursement to
the relevant shareholders, in (A) short-term direct obligations of the United
States of America or (B) short-term obligations for which the full faith and
credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment
of principal and interest. UK Holdco shall be responsible for any losses of
such cash and shall deposit additional cash with the Exchange Agent as may be
required from time to time in order for the Exchange Agent to make the
payments required by this Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to UK Holdco.

Section 1.4 _Parent New York Plans, Unassumed Plans and Other
Employment Agreements and Arrangements_.

  



  

(a) _Application of Parent New York Plans to UK Holdco Common
Stock_.

  



  

(i) To the extent any Parent New York Plan provides for the grant,
issuance, delivery or purchase of, or otherwise relates to, options, awards
of restricted stock or other rights to purchase or receive shares of New York
Common Stock (or the right to receive benefits or amounts by reference to
those shares), from and after the Effective Time, New York or UK Holdco, as
applicable, shall cause such Parent New York Plan to be amended to provide
for the grant, issuance, delivery or purchase of, or otherwise relate to,
shares of UK Holdco Common Stock, and all options or awards issued, or
benefits available or based upon the value of a specified number of shares of
New York Common Stock, under such Parent New York Plans after the Effective
Time shall entitle the holder thereof to purchase or receive, or receive
payment based on, as applicable, an equal number of shares of UK Holdco Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of such Parent New York Plan. Except as
provided in this Section 1.4(a) and for certain amendments to the Parent New
York Plans intended to clarify the meaning of certain provisions in such
Parent New York Plans, the outstanding options, restricted stock awards or
other equity-based awards or benefits available under the terms of any Parent
New York Plan at and following the Effective Time shall, to the extent
permitted by Law and otherwise reasonably practicable, be subject to the same
terms and conditions as under such Parent New York Plan and the agreements
relating thereto immediately prior to the Effective Time (including,
for greater certainty, having the same option exercise or measurement price).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of shares of UK Holdco Common Stock
issuable or available upon the exercise, payment, issuance or availability of
such option, award or benefit immediately after the Effective Time, and the
option exercise or measurement price of each such option, award or benefit,
shall be subject to adjustment by New York or UK Holdco, as applicable, only
to the extent necessary to comply with applicable Law. The foregoing
adjustments shall be made in accordance with applicable Law (and
administrative practice of applicable Governmental Bodies), including but not
limited to Section 409A and Section 422 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, to the extent such provisions are
applicable to an option, award or benefit. Other than as set forth above, the
Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" for purposes of the Parent New
York Plans, to the extent such term is applicable, and will not affect the
underlying terms or conditions of any outstanding equity awards, which shall
remain subject to their original terms and conditions.

(ii) Prior to the Effective Time, New York shall pass such
resolutions and take such other actions, as may be necessary to effect the
provisions of this Section 1.4(a), and New York shall or shall cause UK
Holdco to undertake all corporate action necessary to authorize for allotment
and issuance a sufficient number of shares of UK Holdco Common Stock for
delivery upon exercise or settlement of the stock awards under the Parent New
York Plans.

  



  

(b) _Unassumed Plans and Other Employment Agreements and
Arrangements_. New York shall amend or cause to be amended any Unassumed Plans
and employment agreements and arrangements, other than the Unassumed Plans,
as necessary (i) to provide for the appropriate substitution of UK Holdco in
place of New York, where applicable; (ii) to provide that the Merger will not
constitute a change in control under the terms of any such plan, agreement or
arrangement to the extent permitted or applicable; (iii) to comply with
applicable English or U.S. corporate or tax Law requirements; and (iv) to
make any other conforming or clarifying changes necessary in light of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

committee (other than the Conflicts Committee) of the board of directors of
UK Holdco shall consist of equal representation of New York Designees and

of New York Designees who are not employees of UK Holdco.

  



    

10 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(iv) At the Closing, the charter of each committee of the board of
directors of UK Holdco (except for the Conflicts Committee) shall be the
corresponding charter of such committee of the New York Board as of the date
hereof (except for any modifications necessary to make the terms thereof
consistent with the terms of the Shareholder Agreement or to comply with any
change to applicable Law from the date of this Agreement or the Laws of
England and Wales, or as otherwise agreed to between New York and London). The
charter of the Conflicts Committee shall be consistent with Section 7.5 of

all action necessary to appoint as officers of UK Holdco such two persons
designated by London as set forth on Schedule IV of this Agreement to the
positions and responsibilities as set forth on Schedule IV of this Agreement,

officers of London and New York, as the Chief Executive Officers may mutually
agree. Subject to applicable Law, after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time, the Transition Committee shall have responsibility for
coordinating and directing the efforts of the Parties with respect to
integrating the Business of London and New York, including the activities,
and consistent with the principles, set forth on Schedule V of this Agreement.

(b) London will use its reasonable best efforts to notify New York
in writing no later than (i) thirty (30) calendar days after the date of this
Agreement of the individuals it proposes to designate as London Designees at
the Closing who will be (or who are reasonably likely to be) Shareholder
Affiliated Persons (as defined in the Shareholder Agreement) and (ii) thirty
(30) calendar days prior to the expected date of the filing of the first
amendment to the Form S-4 of the individuals it proposes to designate as
London Designees at the Closing who will not be (or who are reasonably likely
not to be) Shareholder Affiliated Persons (as defined in the Shareholder
Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall New York be entitled to
delay the filing of the Form S-4 (or any amendment thereto) if, despite such
reasonable best efforts, London has not notified New York of all of
London's proposed London Designees by such dates, except to the extent
required by applicable Law. New York will then notify London in writing as
promptly as practicable, but in any event not later than thirty (30) Business
Days after receiving each such notice, of the determination of the Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee of the New York Board (such determination
to be exercised by the New York Board in accordance with, and giving effect
to, Section 7.1 of the Shareholder Agreement), as to whether such
Persons would satisfy the requirements of Section 7.1(d) of the Shareholder
Agreement. If such committee determines that any such designee would not
satisfy the requirements of such Section 7.1(d), then (x) such written notice
shall include with reasonable detail why such designee would not satisfy such
requirements and (y) London shall propose replacement designees in a manner as
contemplated by Section 7.1(d) of the Shareholder Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that prior to the Closing, any of the proposed
London Designees dies, becomes incapacitated, becomes disqualified or is
otherwise no longer willing to serve as a London Designee as of the Closing,
or London, acting in good faith, determines that it is no longer in the best
interests of UK Holdco to propose such person as a London Designee, London
shall use its reasonable best efforts to identify and propose a
replacement London Designee pursuant to this Section 1.5(b) as promptly as
reasonably practical; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event, shall New
York delay the filing of the Form S-4 (or any amendment thereto) or holding of
the New York Stockholder Meeting as a result of such event, except to the
extent required by applicable Law.

  



  

Section 1.6 _Restructure; Reduction of Capital_.

  



  

(a) If, prior to the Closing Date, New York and London determine,
acting reasonably and in good faith and in consultation with their
respective tax advisors, that, as a result of a change in applicable Law
occurring after the date of this Agreement, facts relating to the Merger or
other similar circumstances, New York or UK Holdco (or any of their respective
subsidiaries) is more likely than not to recognize a material amount of
taxable income or gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes or may be subject
to a material amount of U.K. tax, including U.K. corporation tax, stamp duty
and stamp duty reserve tax, in either case, in connection with the
Merger, subject to the provisions of this Section 1.6, each of New York and
London shall give good faith consideration to proposals to seek to
restructure the Merger and related transactions in a manner that reduces or
eliminates such taxable income or gain or tax;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i) any such proposals shall not result in or require an extension of the End
Date or delay the Closing and (ii) no Party shall be required to take any
action if the other Party is in material breach of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) If, prior to the Closing Date, New York and London determine,
acting reasonably and in good faith and in consultation with their
respective legal advisors, that it would be advantageous for UK Holdco to
undertake a reduction of capital under English Law in order to facilitate the
future payment of dividends (if any) by UK Holdco, each of New York and London
shall give good faith consideration to proposals to seek to achieve such a
reduction of capital by UK Holdco; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) any such
proposals shall not result in or require an extension of the End Date or
delay the Closing and (ii) no Party shall be required to take any action if
the other Party is in material breach of this Agreement.

Section 1.7 _Adjustments_.

  



  

Without limiting the effect of Section 5.4, if, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of New York
Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class, by reason of any stock dividend or any
subdivision, reclassification, split, combination, consolidation or exchange
of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any number or
amount contained in this Agreement (including any exchange ratio) which is
based upon the number of shares of UK Holdco Common Stock or shares of New
York Common Stock, as the case may be, will be appropriately adjusted to
provide to UK Holdco and the holders of New York Common Stock and holders of
any outstanding options and awards under the Parent New York Plans, the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 1.7 shall be construed
to permit UK Holdco or New York to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

Governmental Permits are valid and in full force and effect and there exists
no default thereunder or breach thereof, and all renewals have been timely
applied for and will not be subject to suspension, modification, revocation

Transaction Agreements or the consummation of the Transactions and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case except for any non-compliance,
non-effectiveness, suspension, modifications, revocations or non-renewals
that would not materially impair or interfere with the Business. The
London Parties have no notice or actual knowledge that such London
Governmental Permits will not be renewed in the ordinary course after giving
effect to the Transactions. No Governmental Body has taken, or to the
knowledge of the London Parties, threatened to take, any action to terminate,
cancel or reform any London Governmental Permit.

the London Disclosure Letter, there are no material actions, suits or
proceedings (a) pending against any London Group Company (in the case of
London, relating to the Business) or, to the knowledge of the London

course consistent with past practice. Since December 31, 2012, there has been
no change or development that has had a London Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) From December 31, 2012 until the date hereof, there has not been
any action taken by any London Group Company (in the case of London, with
respect to the Business) that, if taken during the period from the date of
this Agreement through the Closing Date without New York's consent, would
constitute a breach of Section 5.3(b)(v).

  



  

Section 3.10 _Taxes_.

  



  

(a) All material Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect
to any Company (including any Tax Return required to be filed by
an affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group that included
London or any of its Subsidiaries) or the Conveyance Properties have been
filed on a timely basis with the appropriate Governmental Body, and all such
Tax Returns are correct and complete in all material respects. All material
Taxes that have become due with respect to the Companies (regardless of
whether reflected on any Tax Return) have been paid or deposited in full on a
timely basis or adequately reserved for in the Financial Statements in
accordance with IFRS. There are no material Liens on any of the Conveyance
Properties that arose in connection with any failure to pay any Tax.

  



  

(b) With respect to both the Companies and the Conveyance Properties
(i) no audit, investigation or other administrative proceeding or
court proceeding is presently pending with regard to any material Tax or Tax
Return as to which any taxing authority has asserted in writing any material
claim; (ii) no Governmental Body is now asserting in writing any deficiency or
claim for material Taxes or any adjustment to material Taxes; and (iii) there
exists no material Liability of the Business for any Tax under Treasury
Regulation § 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of any other Tax Law, except
for Taxes of any affiliated group of which London is the common parent,
within the meaning of Section 1504(a)(1) of the Code or any similar provision
of any other Tax Law. No Company has made or granted any material request,
agreement, consent or waiver to extend any period of limitations applicable to
the assessment of any Tax upon any Company or with respect to the Conveyance
Properties. No Company is a party to any closing agreement described in
Section 7121 of the Code or any predecessor provision thereof or any similar
agreement under any Tax Law. No Company is a party to, is bound by or has any
obligation under any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnity agreement or any
similar agreement or arrangement other than with respect to any such
agreement or arrangement solely among the Companies or any customary gross-up
and indemnification provisions in credit agreements, derivatives, leases,
supply agreements and similar agreements entered into in the ordinary
course of business. Since January 1, 2013, London has not made or rescinded
any material election relating to Taxes or settled or compromised any claim,
action, suit, litigation, proceeding, arbitration, investigation, audit or
controversy relating to any material Taxes, or except as may be required by
Law, made any material change to any of its methods of reporting income or
deductions for Tax purposes from those employed in the preparation of its
most recently filed Tax Returns. None of the Companies has engaged in any
"listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation § 1.6011-4. To
the knowledge of the London Parties, the Companies have not been United
States real property holding corporations within the meaning of Section
897(c)(2) of the Code at any time within the past five (5) years. No notice
or inquiry has been received from any jurisdiction in which Tax Returns have
not been filed by the Companies or London (in respect of the Conveyance
Properties or the Business) to the effect that the filing of Tax Returns may
be required. No Company has any material (i) income reportable for a period
ending after the Closing but attributable to a transaction (e.g., an
installment sale) occurring in or a change in accounting method made for a
period ending on or prior to the Closing that resulted in a deferred
reporting of income from such transaction or from such change in accounting
method (other than a deferred intercompany transaction) or (ii) deferred gain
or loss arising out of any deferred intercompany transaction.
The Transactions will not cause any Company to recognize gain by reason of
Section 355(e) of the Code.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(c) of the London Disclosure
Letter, no London Group Plan (including for such purpose, any

excise tax or be non-deductible to London under Sections 4999 and 280G of the
Code, respectively, whether or not some other subsequent action or event would
be required to cause such payment or benefit to be triggered and (ii) the
execution of, and performance of the Transactions and other transactions
contemplated by, the London Transaction Agreements will not (either alone or
upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an
event under any benefit plan, policy, arrangement or agreement or any trust or
loan (in connection therewith) that will or may result in any payment
(whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of
indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligations to
fund benefits with respect to any Business Employee.

  



  

(f) No London Group Plan provides medical, surgical,
hospitalization, death or similar benefits (whether or not insured) for
Business Employees for periods extending beyond their retirement or other
termination of service other than (i) coverage mandated by Law, (ii) death
benefits under any "pension plan" or (iii) benefits the full cost of which is
borne by the current or former employee (or his beneficiary).

each Business Plan may at any time be unilaterally amended or terminated in
its entirety, in accordance with the terms thereof, without liability except
as to benefits accrued thereunder prior to such amendment or termination.

would not be reasonably likely to materially impair or interfere with the
Business.

  



  

(i) From July 1, 2013 to the date of this Agreement, except in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, there has not been
(i) any granting, or any commitment or promise to grant, by any London Group
Company to any officer of any London Group Company of (A) any increase in

to the Business and the ownership and operation of the Conveyance Properties,
excluding such noncompliance as, individually or in the aggregate, would not

the conduct of their respective businesses thereon in the manner now conducted
or that is reasonably likely to materially interfere with continued
compliance with any applicable Environmental Law.

aggregate, in a material Liability; _provided_ , that the foregoing does not
apply to any matters that have been fully resolved with no further liability
or obligation on behalf of any London Group Company.

  



  

(c) The London Group Companies hold all material Environmental
Permits required for the construction and operation of the Conveyance
Properties and the operation of the Business as conducted immediately prior
to the date of this Agreement (collectively, the " _London Environmental
Permits_ "), and a true and correct list of all such London Environmental
Permits as of the date of this Agreement is set forth on Section 3.13(c)(i)
of the London Disclosure Letter, which list identifies the relevant
Governmental Body, the current expiration date, and the current holder of
such London Environmental Permits. The London Group Companies are in
compliance with all terms and conditions of the London Environmental Permits
excluding any noncompliance, individually or in the aggregate, as would not
be reasonably likely to result in material Liability. Except as set forth on
Section 3.13(c)(ii) of the London Disclosure Letter, the material London
Environmental Permits are valid and in full force and effect, and all renewals
have been timely applied for. No Governmental Body has provided written
notice of any actual or threatened action to terminate, suspend, cancel or

property owned by the London PRC Sub, that London owns in fee (or the
jurisdictional equivalent) and is primarily used in the Business
(collectively, the " _Non-PRC London Owned Real Property_ ") and, for each of
those properties, the title holder, the address of such property, whether
such property includes land and/or improvements and the general use
thereof. Except to the extent failure of the same, individually or in the
aggregate, would not or would not be reasonably likely to materially impair
the continued use of such Non-PRC London Owned Real Property as currently
conducted or the operation of the Business, the Non-PRC London Group
Companies own legal and valid fee simple title (or, for real property situated
in Texas, good and indefeasible fee simple title, and in other jurisdictions,
the jurisdictional equivalent) to the Non-PRC London Owned Real Property free
and clear of any Liens, other than Permitted Liens. Except as set forth in
Section 3.28(a) of the London Disclosure Letter, the Non-PRC London Group
Companies have not leased to any third party or granted to any third party the
right to occupy the Non-PRC London Owned Real Property or any portion
thereof.

  



  

(b) Section 3.28(b) of the London Disclosure Letter lists and
correctly describes all real property that (i) is leased, subleased,
licensed or otherwise used by any Company other than the London PRC Sub and
(ii) is leased, subleased, licensed or otherwise used by London, other than
the London PRC Sub, primarily in connection with the Business (collectively,
the " _Non-PRC London Leased Real Property_ " and, together with the Non-PRC
London Owned Real Property, the " _Non-PRC London Real Property_ ") and, for
each of those properties, identifies the lease, sublease, license or occupancy
agreement, as applicable, and all amendments thereto (the " _Non-PRC London
Real Property Lease_ "), the counterparty to the Non-PRC London Real Property
Lease, the address of such property, whether such property includes land
and/or improvements and the general use thereof. A true, correct and complete
copy of each Non-PRC London Real Property Lease has been delivered to the New
York Parties. The Non-PRC London Group Companies have valid leasehold (or, as
applicable, license or other contractual) interests in the Non-PRC London
Leased Real Property, free and clear of any Liens, other than Permitted
Liens. Except to the extent failure of the same would not or would not be

London Leased Real Property as currently conducted or the operation of the
Business, (i) each Non-PRC London Real Property Lease is in full force and

Property Lease and, to the knowledge of the London Parties, no counterparty
to any Non-PRC London Real Property Lease is in breach thereof.

(c) Except to the extent failure of the same, individually or in the
aggregate, would not or would not be reasonably likely to materially impair
the continued use of such Non-PRC London Owned Real Property as currently
conducted or the operation of the Business, the Non-PRC London Real Property
(i) has access to and from public highways, streets and roads and there is no
proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the London Parties, threatened
that could result in the termination of or material limitations on such
access and (ii) is connected to and serviced by utilities and public
services, all of which are adequate for the use of the real property listed
thereon as the Business of the Non-PRC London Group Companies as currently
conducted. Except to the extent failure of the same would not or would not be
reasonably likely to materially impair the continued use of such Non-PRC
London Real Property as currently conducted or the operation of the Business,
there are no pending or, to the knowledge of the London Parties,
threatened proceedings to take all or any portion of the Non-PRC London Real
Property or any interest therein or portion thereof by eminent domain or any
condemnation proceeding (or the equivalent proceedings in other jurisdictions)
or any sale or disposition in lieu thereof. Except as set forth on Section
3.28(c) of the London Disclosure Letter, the use or occupancy of the Non-PRC
London Real Property (or any portion thereof) or the operation of the
Business as currently conducted thereon is not dependent on a "permitted non-
conforming use" or "permitted non-conforming structure" or similar variance,
exemption or approval from any Governmental Body. The London Real Property
collectively consists of all real property necessary for the conduct of the
Business as currently conducted.

approvals contemplated by the Regulatory Filings, London has the full
right to convey and transfer to London Taiwan NewCo Sub legal and valid fee

impair the continued use of such New York Real Property as currently conducted
or the operation of the business of New York and its Subsidiaries. There
exists no material default or breach with respect to, and no party or
Governmental Body has taken or, to the knowledge of New York, threatened to

documents (including exhibits and any amendments thereto) required to be so
filed by them since January 1, 2010 pursuant to Sections 13(a), 14(a) and

registration statement, report, proxy statement or information statement
(other than preliminary materials) they have so filed, each in the form
(including exhibits and any amendments thereto) as filed with the SEC
(collectively, the " _New York Reports_ "). As of its respective date, each
New York Report (i) complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except for any statements in any New
York Report that have been modified by an amendment to such report filed with
the SEC prior to the date hereof. Each of the consolidated balance sheets
included in or incorporated by reference into the New York Reports (including
related notes and schedules) complied as to form in all material respects
with the applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and fairly presents in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of New York and its
Subsidiaries (or such entities as indicated in such balance sheet) as of its
date, and each of the consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and
changes in stockholders' equity included in or incorporated by reference into
the New York Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly
presents in all material respects the results of operations, cash flows or
changes in stockholders' equity, as the case may be, of New York and its
Subsidiaries (or such entities as indicated in such balance sheet) for the
periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
(x) such exceptions as may be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and (y)
normal, recurring year-end audit adjustments which are not material in the
aggregate), in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during
the periods involved, except as may be noted therein. Except as and to the
extent set forth on the consolidated balance sheet of New York and its
Subsidiaries included in the most recent New York Report filed prior to
the date of this Agreement that includes such a balance sheet, including all
notes thereto, as of the date hereof, neither New York nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required to be
reflected on, or reserved against in, a consolidated balance sheet of New York
or in the notes thereto prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied, other than current liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
business or liabilities or obligations which, individually or in the
aggregate, are not and are not reasonably likely to be material in nature. To
the knowledge of the New York Parties, as of the date of this Agreement, none
of the New York Reports is the subject of ongoing SEC review or outstanding
SEC investigation and there are no outstanding or unresolved comments received
from the SEC with respect to any of the New York Reports. There has been no
material correspondence between the SEC and New York since January 1, 2010

officers have received notice from any Governmental Body questioning
or challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or
submission of such certification. New York maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act); such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that all material

summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC and is made known on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for preparing the New York Reports and other public

significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of
its internal controls over financial reporting or fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in New York's internal controls. To the knowledge of the New
York Parties, New York's auditors and its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer will be able to give the certifications and attestations

reasonable best efforts to cause New York's and its Subsidiaries' respective
investment bankers, accountants, attorneys, financial advisors, auditors,
lenders and other advisors, agents and representatives (collectively, and
together with New York's and its Subsidiaries' respective officers, directors
and employees, " _Representatives_ "), to (i) immediately cease and cause to
be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to
lead to, any New York Acquisition Proposal, (ii) use reasonable best efforts
to have all copies of all nonpublic information that New York, its
Subsidiaries and New York's or its Subsidiaries' Representatives have
previously furnished or distributed on or prior to the date of this Agreement
to any such Person promptly returned or destroyed, (iii) except to the extent
the New York Board determines in good faith that failure to do so would
reasonably likely be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, not terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any provision of any
confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement to which it or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives is a party with respect to any New
York Acquisition Proposal or potential New York Acquisition Proposal and (iv)
except to the extent the New York Board determines in good faith that failure
to do so would reasonably likely be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, enforce any such agreement. From the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Closing and the date of termination of this
Agreement, New York shall not, shall cause its Subsidiaries not to and shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause New York's and its Subsidiaries'
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (1) solicit, initiate,
endorse, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing nonpublic information), or take any other action designed to
facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, a New York Acquisition Proposal,
(2) enter into any Acquisition Agreement or enter into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding requiring New York to abandon, terminate or fail
to consummate the Transactions or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, (3) enter into, initiate, continue or otherwise participate in any
way in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish or disclose to
any Person (other than a Party) any nonpublic information with respect to, or
take any other action to knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of
any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
New York Acquisition Proposal (other than contacting and engaging in
discussions with the maker of any New York Acquisition Proposal or its
Representatives for the sole purpose of clarifying any such New York
Acquisition Proposal and informing such Person or its Representatives of the
existence of this Section 5.1) or (4) resolve, agree or propose to do any of
the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that, at any time prior to
obtaining the New York Stockholder Approval, in response to an unsolicited,
bona fide, written New York Acquisition Proposal that (A) did not result from
a material breach of this Section 5.1 and (B) the New York Board determines in
its good faith judgment (after consultation with its outside counsel and
financial advisors) constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
New York Superior Proposal, New York may, subject to compliance with Section
5.1(d), (x) furnish information with respect to New York and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such New York Acquisition Proposal (and its
Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement containing
terms substantially similar to, and that is not less restrictive of such
Person than, the Confidentiality Agreement (except that such agreement need
not prohibit, condition or restrict the making or amendment of an Acquisition
Proposal to the New York Board and except that the standstill provisions of
such agreement may be waived by the New York Board if the New York Board
determines in good faith that failure to do so would reasonably likely be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all such information has previously been provided or made
available to London or is provided or made available to London prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, and
(y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
New York Acquisition Proposal (and its representatives) regarding such New
York Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Neither the New York Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)
(A) withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to London), or
propose to withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to London), the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the New York Board
or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Transactions or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (B) recommend, adopt or approve,
or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve any New York Acquisition
Proposal, (C) fail to include the New York Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement or (D) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing (any
action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _New York Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) (A) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose
publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, or allow New York or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is
intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any New York
Acquisition Proposal or that would require New York to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the Transactions (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in Section 5.1(a)) (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (B)
resolve, agree or propose to do any of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, prior to
obtaining the New York Stockholder Approval, the New York Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and financial
advisors) that the failure to do so would reasonably likely be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to New York's stockholders under applicable Law, it
may (A) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i) and cause New
York to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a New York
Superior Proposal or (B) make a New York Adverse Recommendation Change in
connection with a New York Superior Proposal, but in the case of (A) or (B)
only if: (w) such New York Superior Proposal has not resulted from a material
breach of its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.1, (x) New York provides
written notice to London (a " _New York Notice of Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ") advising London that the New York Board intends to take such
action and specifying the reasons therefor, including, if applicable, the
terms and conditions of any New York Superior Proposal, the identity of the
Person making the New York Superior Proposal and copies of all relevant
documents relating to such New York Superior Proposal that New York has
received from the Person or its representatives that made such proposal and
that are the basis of the proposed action by the New York Board, including a
copy of the proposed Acquisition Agreement (if any) (it being understood and
agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of
such New York Superior Proposal shall require a new New York Notice of
Adverse Recommendation Change and compliance with the requirements of this
Section 5.1(b)); (y) during a period of five (5) Business Days following
London's receipt of a New York Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change (or,
in the event of a new New York Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change, a new
3-Business Day period), if requested by London, New York and its
Representatives shall have negotiated with London and its Representatives
in good faith to make such revisions or adjustments proposed by London to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable New York to proceed
with its recommendation of this Agreement and the Transactions and not make
such New York Adverse Recommendation Change; and (z) if applicable, at the
end of such applicable 5- or 3-Business Day period, the New York Board, after
considering in good faith any such revisions or adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement that London, prior to the expiration of such
applicable period, shall have offered in writing in a manner that would form a
binding contract if accepted by New York, continues to determine in good
faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors)
that the New York Acquisition Proposal constitutes a New York Superior
Proposal.

(c) Other than in connection with a New York Acquisition Proposal,
New York may, at any time prior to, but not after, obtaining the New
York Stockholder Approval, make a New York Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to an Intervening Event (a " _New York Intervening Event Change in
Recommendation_ ") if the New York Board shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, because of such
Intervening Event, a failure to take such action would reasonably likely be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the New York Board to the
stockholders of New York under applicable Law, _provided_ , that: (A) London
shall have received written notice from New York of New York's intention to
make a New York Intervening Event Change in Recommendation (a " _New York
Notice of Intervening Event Change in Recommendation_ ") at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the taking of such action by New York, which notice
shall specify the applicable Intervening Event in reasonable detail (
_provided_ , that any material change to the facts and circumstances that are
the basis for such New York Intervening Event Change in Recommendation shall
require a new New York Notice of Intervening Event Change in Recommendation
and a new 3-Business Day period), (B) during such applicable period and prior
to making a New York Intervening Event Change in Recommendation, if
requested by London, New York and its Representatives shall have negotiated
in good faith with London and its Representatives regarding any revisions or
adjustments proposed by London to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
as would enable New York to proceed with its recommendation of this Agreement
and the Transactions and not make such New York Intervening Event Change in
Recommendation and (C) New York may make a New York Intervening Event Change
in Recommendation only if the New York Board, after considering in good faith
any revisions or adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
that London shall have, prior to the expiration of the applicable 3- or
5-Business Day period, offered in writing in a manner that would form a
binding contract if accepted by New York, continues to determine in good
faith that failure to make a New York Intervening Event Change in
Recommendation would reasonably likely be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the New York stockholders under applicable Law. An "
_Intervening Event_ " shall mean any event, fact, circumstance or development
or combination thereof that (i) was not known to the New York Board as of the
date of this Agreement (or if known, the consequences or magnitude of which
were not known or reasonably foreseeable) and (ii) does not relate to (A) any
Acquisition Proposal or (B) clearance of the Transactions under the HSR Act or
any foreign antitrust, competition or similar Law including any action in
connection therewith taken pursuant to or required to be taken pursuant to
Section 5.8, Section 5.9 or Section 5.10; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
increase in the price or trading volume of New York Common Stock shall not be
taken into account for purposes of determining whether an Intervening Event
has occurred (it being acknowledged, however, that any underlying cause
thereof may be taken into account for purposes of determining whether an
Intervening Event has occurred); and New York meeting or exceeding projections
shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether an
Intervening Event has occurred (it being acknowledged, however, that any
underlying cause thereof may be taken into account for purposes of
determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred).

(d) New York shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four
(24) hours of receipt) notify London orally and in writing of the
receipt, directly or indirectly, of (i) any New York Acquisition Proposal or
a proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead to a New York
Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any inquiry or request for discussions or
negotiations relating to a possible New York Acquisition Proposal. Such
notice shall indicate the identity of the Person or group making such inquiry,
request, proposal, offer or New York Acquisition Proposal and the material
terms and conditions thereof (including, if applicable, copies of any written
requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements, received from
such Person or group or their representatives). Thereafter, New York
shall keep London promptly informed (including within twenty-four (24) hours
after the occurrence of any amendment or modification,
development, discussion or negotiation) orally and in writing in all material
respects of the status and substance of such inquiry, request, proposal,
offer or New York Acquisition Proposal, including providing London with copies
of any written inquiries, correspondence and draft documentation received
from such Person or group and written summaries of any material oral inquiries
or discussions. Without limiting any of the foregoing, New York shall
promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) notify
London orally and in writing if New York begins furnishing information or
participating in discussions or negotiations pursuant to Section 5.1(a).

  



  

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.1 shall prohibit New York or
the New York Board from (i) taking and disclosing to New York's stockholders
a position contemplated by or complying with any disclosure obligations under
Exchange Act Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or (ii)
making any disclosure to the stockholders of New York if, in the good faith
judgment of the New York Board (after consultation with outside counsel), the
failure to make such disclosure would reasonably likely be inconsistent with
its obligations or duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that
clause (ii) shall not be deemed to permit the New York Board to make a New
York Adverse Recommendation Change or take any of the actions referred to in
Section 5.1(b) or Section 5.1(c), except to the extent permitted by such
Section.

--- 

    



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
factually accurate public statement by New York that describes New
York's receipt of a New York Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed to be a New York Adverse
Recommendation Change.

  



  

(g) Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation
of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.1 by any Representative of
New York or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section
5.1 by the New York Parties.

  



  

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

  



  

(i) " _New York Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry,
proposal or offer from any Person relating to any (A) direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase, in a single transaction or a series of
transactions, of assets or a business of New York or its Subsidiaries that
constitutes or generates 20% or more of the consolidated net revenue, earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (on an estimated
current replacement cost basis) for the preceding twelve (12) months or the

indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of any class of equity
securities (by vote or value) of New York or any of its Subsidiaries, (C)
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person
beneficially owning 20% or more of the equity securities (by vote or value)
of New York or any of its Subsidiaries, (D) merger, consolidation, business
combination, asset purchase, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution,
binding share exchange or similar transaction involving New York or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any Person (or the stockholders of any
Person) would own, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the voting Capital
Stock of New York or any of its Subsidiaries or the surviving entity in a
merger or the resulting direct or indirect parent of New York or such
surviving entity or (E) any combination of the foregoing, in each case other
than the Transactions.

(ii) " _New York Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written New
York Acquisition Proposal to acquire 50% or more of the outstanding equity
securities of New York pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger,
consolidation or similar transaction or to acquire assets or a business of
New York or any of its Subsidiaries that constitutes or generates 50% or more
of the consolidated net revenue, earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization (on an estimated current replacement cost basis)
for the preceding twelve (12) months or the assets of New York and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that in each case the New York Board
determines in its good faith judgment (after consulting with outside counsel
and its financial advisor), taking into account the financial, regulatory and
legal aspects of the proposal that the New York Board deems relevant, the
identity of the Person making such proposal and the timing and likelihood of
consummation of such proposal, is: (A) more favorable to the stockholders of
New York than the Transactions, taking into account all relevant factors that
the New York Board deems relevant (including the terms and conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement proposed by London, in response to such offer or otherwise,
in a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by New York)), (B)
not subject to a financing condition or, if subject thereto, such financing
is reasonably likely to be obtained in the good faith judgment of the New
York Board and (C) reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account
all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal that the
New York Board deems relevant.

  



  

(i) London shall, shall cause its Subsidiaries to and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause London's and its
Subsidiaries' Representatives to (i) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to
lead to, any London Acquisition Proposal, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to

Proposal and (iv) enforce any such agreement. From the date of this Agreement
until the earlier of the Closing and the date of termination of this
Agreement, London shall not, shall cause its Subsidiaries not to and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause London's and its Subsidiaries'
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate,

facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, a London Acquisition Proposal, (B)
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint

material changes to the terms thereof. As used herein, " _London Acquisition
Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person with
respect to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in a single
transaction or a series of transactions, of all or any part of the Conveyance

thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the meeting of New York's
stockholders to be held for the purpose of obtaining the New York Stockholder
Approval (such meeting, the " _New York Stockholder Meeting_ ") in accordance
and in compliance with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder and (ii) the Form S-4, which UK Holdco shall file with the SEC,
and in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of the
Parties will cooperate in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and Form
S-4. Each of the London Parties shall promptly supply to New York in

their respective Affiliates, directors, company supervisors or officers,
should be discovered by the New York Parties or the London Parties which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or
Form S-4, so that such document would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Party and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be prepared and disseminated to the
stockholders of New York to the extent required by Law. After all
the comments received from the SEC have been cleared by the SEC staff and all
information required to be contained in the Proxy Statement or Form S-4 has
been included therein by New York and UK Holdco, if applicable, New York shall
promptly file the definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC and cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed (including by electronic delivery if permitted) as
promptly as practicable, to its stockholders of record, as of the record date
established by the New York Board pursuant to Section 5.2(c) and set forth in
the Proxy Statement.

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof,
London shall furnish all information concerning it, the Business,
its Affiliates and, to the extent available to London and permitted by
applicable Taiwan securities Laws, the holders of London's common stock
(including a description of the Business, an operating and financial review, a
discussion of quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risk and
information regarding its designees to be directors on the New York Board) as
may be reasonably requested and as required by the applicable rules of the
SEC and other Laws, and such other information as the SEC or any
other Governmental Body may reasonably request or require, in connection with
the preparation of the Proxy Statement and Form S-4. In furtherance of the
foregoing, London shall supply such audited and unaudited financial statements

information referred to in Section 3.26(a) and Section 3.26(b)), to the extent
required for such Proxy Statement and Form S-4, and any reports, attestations
or similar documents by London's auditor to be included in the Proxy
Statement and Form S-4 to New York for inclusion in the Proxy Statement and
Form S-4 as are necessary and appropriate to comply as to form in all
material respects with the accounting requirements and other rules and
regulations applicable to the Proxy Statement and Form S-4, including the
rules and regulations of the SEC, which financial statements and information
shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS and shall fairly present the
financial condition of the Business in all material respects in accordance
with IFRS as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of
operations and cash flows of the Business for the respective periods then
ended. All information supplied by or on behalf of London for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement and Form S-4 will comply as
to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other applicable Law, including Taiwan
Law (including the rules of the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation).

  



  

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date on
which the SEC shall clear (whether orally or in writing) the Proxy
Statement, unless the New York Board has effected a New York Adverse
Recommendation Change, and subject to the London Parties' timely performance
of its obligations set forth in Section 5.2(b), New York shall take all action
in accordance with the federal securities Laws, the DGCL, the New York
Certificate and the New York Bylaws necessary to establish a record date for,
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the New York Stockholder Meeting
as soon as reasonably practical for purposes of seeking the New York
Stockholder Approval and to solicit proxies pursuant to the Proxy Statement
in connection therewith. New York may adjourn or postpone the New York
Stockholder Meeting (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement
or amendment to the Proxy Statement that it determines in good faith is
required by applicable Law to be disseminated to its stockholders or (ii) if
there are insufficient shares of New York Common Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the New York Stockholder Meeting. New York shall, through the New
York Board, recommend to its stockholders that they give the New York
Stockholder Approval (the " _New York Recommendation_ ") and the New York
Recommendation shall be set forth in the Proxy Statement, except, in each
case, to the extent that the New York Board shall have made a New York Adverse
Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 5.1(b) or (c).

held for the purpose of obtaining the London Stockholder Approval (such
meeting, the " _London Stockholder Meeting_ ") in accordance and in compliance
with Taiwan Law (including the rules of the Taiwan Stock Exchange
Corporation). Prior to mailing the London Notice (or any amendment or
supplement thereto), London shall provide New York with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the London Notice and all documents
attached thereto. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the

in accordance with Taiwan Law and the articles of incorporation of London
necessary to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold the London Stockholder Meeting as soon as reasonably practical for

efforts in connection therewith to obtain such approval. London shall
cause the London Notice to be mailed (including by electronic delivery if
permitted) as promptly as practicable to its stockholders of record, as of
the record date established by the London Board and set forth in the London
Notice. London may adjourn or postpone the London Stockholder Meeting (i) to
the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the London
Notice that it determines in good faith is required by applicable Law to be
disseminated to its stockholders is so disseminated or (ii) if there are
insufficient shares of London Common Stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the London
Stockholder Meeting. London shall provide New York with reasonable
documentation to demonstrate that the votes of all of the London shares that
are the subject of voting agreements referenced in the recitals to this
Agreement are cast in accordance with such voting agreements.

London Group Companies to use its commercially reasonable efforts, to
preserve intact the Business, their respective business organizations and
goodwill, keep available the services of their respective officers and
Business employees and maintain satisfactory relationships with those persons

Employees shall be required, within ten (10) Business Days following the
Closing Date, to sign the New York ethics policy document and, as appropriate,
the non-competition and confidentiality agreements that are required for
similarly situated newly hired or re-hired New York employees and contractors,

be terminated without payment of severance, except to the extent required by
applicable Laws.

  



  

(c) No later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the record date
of the Taiwan Spin-Off (the " _Taiwan Spin-Off Record Date_ "), London shall
cause London Taiwan NewCo Sub to give written offers of employment to each
London Taiwan Employee in accordance with Article 16 of the Taiwan Business
Mergers and Acquisitions Act (the " _Taiwan M andA Act_"), which shall
provide for continued employment effective as of Taiwan Spin-Off Record Date
(or, in the case of London Taiwan Employees who are not actively employed as
of the Taiwan Spin-Off Record Date due to short-term disability, long-term
disability or approved leave of absence (collectively, the " _Taiwan LOA
Employees_ "), effective as of the Taiwan LOA Employee's return to
active employment not more than one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days
following the Taiwan Spin-Off Record Date) with a base rate of pay and, to
the extent applicable, target incentive compensation opportunities at least
equal to those in effect in respect of the London Taiwan Employee immediately
prior to the Taiwan Spin-Off Record Date and with benefits similar in the
aggregate to the benefits maintained in respect of the London Taiwan Employee
immediately prior to the Taiwan Spin-Off Record Date. For one (1) year after
the Closing Date, UK Holdco shall cause London Taiwan NewCo Sub not to
terminate, except for cause, which shall include any cause under Articles 11
and 12 of the Labor Standards Act of Taiwan, the employment of any Transferred
Taiwan Employee. Offers of employment made by London Taiwan NewCo Sub
pursuant to this Section 5.6(c) will be made in accordance with all
applicable Laws, be conditioned on (i) executing an ethics policy document,
non-competition agreement and confidentiality agreement, in each case, that
New York or a New York Affiliate requires its similarly situated Taiwan
employees to execute and (ii) the occurrence of the Taiwan Spin-Off, and
remain open for a period of at least ten (10) calendar days. Employees may
accept or reject such offer of employment by notice in writing within such
10-day period, and those who do not notify within such period shall be deemed
to have accepted the offer of employment in accordance with the Taiwan MandA
Act. To the extent permitted by applicable Laws, London shall provide to New
York copies of all written offers of employment made to the London Taiwan
Employees within five (5) Business Days of providing written offers to the
London Taiwan Employees. At least seven (7) calendar days prior to the Taiwan
Spin-Off Record Date, London shall notify New York in writing of the London
Taiwan Employees who have accepted or are deemed to have accepted offers of
employment with London Taiwan NewCo Sub (each a " _Transferred Taiwan
Employee_ "). Employment with London Taiwan NewCo Sub of Transferred Taiwan
Employees shall be effective as of the Taiwan Spin-Off Record Date or, in the
case of a Transferred Taiwan Employee who is a Taiwan LOA Employee, as of the
Taiwan LOA Employee's return to active employment within one hundred and
eighty (180) calendar days following the Taiwan Spin-Off Record Date or such
longer period as may be required by applicable Law (the effective time of
employment, the " _Taiwan Employee Transfer Time_ "). For the avoidance
of doubt, a Transferred Taiwan Employee who is a Taiwan LOA Employee shall be
treated as an employee of London or its Affiliates other than London Taiwan
NewCo Sub unless and until the Taiwan LOA Employee returns to active
employment within one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days following the
Taiwan Spin-Off Record Date (or such later date as may be required by
applicable Law). Except as provided below, London and New York shall be
responsible for equally sharing any costs, obligations or Liabilities,
including statutorily mandated severance pay, which may result from the
termination of employment by London of any London Taiwan Employee who is
offered employment with London Taiwan NewCo Sub pursuant to this Section
5.6(c) but who does not accept such offer of employment;  _provided_
_however_ , that London shall be solely responsible for any severance payments
to the extent in excess of the severance payments mandated by applicable
Laws. All Transferred Taiwan Employees shall be eligible to continue to
participate in the statutory labor and health insurance programs and pension
schemes required by applicable Laws.

(d) To the extent required by applicable Law, (i) London will pay or
cause to be paid to each Transferred Taiwan Employee all salary or other
compensation or employment benefits which have accrued to the Transferred
Taiwan Employee prior to the Closing Date, or, if later, the Taiwan Employee
Transfer Time, for a Transferred Taiwan Employee (such times, as applicable,
together with the Closing Date for the Assumed Employees, the " _Transfer
Time_ ") and (ii) each Transferred Taiwan Employee shall be entitled to
receive from London Taiwan NewCo Sub any unused earned or accrued vacation
time or other paid time off that he or she may have earned in the calendar
year immediately prior to, and including, the Transfer Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, if London Taiwan NewCo Sub deems it necessary (to the
extent permitted by applicable Laws) to disallow such Transferred Taiwan
Employee from taking such earned or accrued vacation time or other paid time
off and such time cannot be rescheduled during the year of the
Closing, London Taiwan NewCo Sub shall be liable for and pay in cash to each
Transferred Taiwan Employee an amount equal to the time not taken as provided
under the terms of the applicable vacation and paid time off policy of London
or its Affiliates as in effect immediately prior to the Transfer Time; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that upon the termination of employment of a
Transferred Taiwan Employee during the year of the Closing, such Person shall
receive a cash payment from London Taiwan NewCo Sub equal to the amount of
such Person's unused earned or accrued vacation time or other paid time off as
of the termination of employment.

  



  

(e) New York or London Taiwan NewCo Sub shall not assume any of the
London Group Plans other than the Business Plans and shall have
no obligations or Liabilities with respect to the London Group Plans other
than the Business Plans unless provided for under this Section 5.6 or
applicable Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that this Section 5.6(e) is subject
to Section 5.6(b), Section 5.6(c) and Section 5.6(n) and to the extent this
Section 5.6(e) conflicts with either Section 5.6(b), Section 5.6(c) or
Section 5.6(n), the terms of Section 5.6(b), Section 5.6(c) or Section
5.6(n), as applicable, shall govern. Without limiting the
preceding provisions of this Section 5.6, beginning at the Transfer Time, the
employee benefit plans that New York, New York's Affiliates or London Taiwan
NewCo Sub maintain, contribute to or participate in shall be, to the extent
permitted by applicable Laws, made available to each Transferred Taiwan
Employee if and when, and on the same terms and conditions, as such plan would
be made available to a new employee of London Taiwan NewCo Sub who is
similarly situated to the Transferred Taiwan Employee.

(f) Each Assumed Employee and Transferred Taiwan Employee shall
become eligible to participate in a group health plan of New York or a
New York Affiliate effective as of the Transfer Time. With respect to any
group health plan or program of New York or New York's Affiliates in which an
Assumed Employee or Transferred Taiwan Employee becomes eligible to
participate as of the Closing or thereafter, New York shall ensure that such
Assumed Employee or Transferred Taiwan Employee shall (i) in the calendar year
of the Closing receive credit for any deductibles, co-pays or other out-of-
pocket expenses paid under the corresponding group health plan or program
of London or its Affiliates for such calendar year, and (ii) not be subject
to any pre-existing condition limitations to the extent that such pre-
existing condition limitation did not apply to such Assumed Employee or
Transferred Taiwan Employee under the corresponding group health plan or
program of London or its Affiliates. Alternatively, London agrees that New
York may, in its sole discretion, continue the group health plans or programs
maintained by London prior to the Closing Date and allow Assumed Employees and
Transferred Taiwan Employees to continue their participation in such plans
following the Closing Date.

  



  

(g) New York and New York's Affiliates shall credit each Assumed
Employee and Transferred Taiwan Employee with the same number of years of
service, including partial years of service, as the Assumed Employee or
Transferred Taiwan Employee is credited with by London or its Affiliates (or
any other employer service which was previously recognized by London or its
Affiliates), under the applicable benefit plan sponsored by New York or New
York's Affiliates to the extent allowable by applicable Laws. The
service credit required by this Section 5.6(g) shall apply for all purposes
under any health, severance, vacation, sick or any similar paid-time off
program or other employee welfare benefit plan (as such term is defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA) of New York or New York's Affiliates and for purposes
of eligibility to participate (other than for a frozen plan or program),
vesting and eligibility for a particular form or type of benefit, but not
benefit accruals, under any savings or other employee pension benefit plan
(as such term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) of New York or New York's
Affiliates.

  



  

(h) During the Transition Period, London shall make its employees
who are not Business Employees but who provide services related to the
Business available to provide services to New York or London Taiwan NewCo
Sub, as the case may be, pursuant to a transition services agreement or a
shared services agreement. At the end of the Transition Period with respect to
a particular aspect of the Business, subject to the agreement of London, New
York or London Taiwan NewCo Sub, as the case may be, shall have the
opportunity to make additional offers of employment to any such employees.

(i) Effective not later than immediately before the Closing, New
York shall amend the New York Plan identified on Section 5.6(i) of the New
York Disclosure Letter to reduce the ownership interest requirement for a
change in control from 50% to 40% with respect to transactions (other than
merger or consolidation transactions) that may occur subsequent to the
Transactions. With respect to any options to acquire or restricted or
unrestricted equity awards of UK Holdco Common Stock granted to employees,
officers, consultants and directors after the Closing Date under New York's
2009 Equity Incentive Plan or other equity plan adopted by UK Holdco or New
York or its Affiliates after the Closing Date, New York or UK Holdco, as
applicable, shall cause (or New York shall cause its Affiliates to cause) the
vesting or exercisability of any such options and equity awards not to
accelerate after their grant date if after the grant date the aggregate share
holdings of London and its respective Affiliates comes to exceed 50% of the
total fair market value or total voting power of the UK Holdco Common Stock
solely due to a decrease in the total number of shares of UK Holdco
Common Stock that are outstanding.

  



  

(j) With respect to Business Employees to whom New York or London
Taiwan NewCo Sub extends an offer of employment pursuant to the provisions of
this Section 5.6, each London Group Company hereby waives and agrees to waive
any non-competition, confidentiality or other employment Contract obligation
for the sole purpose of permitting such employee to accept such employment
offer.

  



  

(k) The London Group Companies shall cause each of their respective
Business Employees located in the United States to have as of the Closing a
fully nonforfeitable right to such employee's accrued benefits, if any, under
any London Group Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code. Upon the written request from New York not more than thirty (30)
calendar days before the Closing Date, London shall cause the 401(k) plan
maintained in respect of Business Employees in the United States to be
terminated as of not later than immediately before the Closing Date.

  



  

(l) The provisions of this Agreement are for the benefit of the New
York Parties and the London Parties only, and no employee of any London Group
Company or any other Person shall have any rights hereunder.

  



  

(m) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
terms and conditions of any employment offer under this Section 5.6 and any
employment after the Transfer Time for any Assumed Employee or Transferred
Taiwan Employee whose employment is subject to a collective
bargaining agreement or similar Contract with any labor organization or
employee association shall be governed by such agreement or Contract until
its expiration, modification or termination in accordance with its terms and
applicable Laws.

  



  

(n) The New York Parties shall have no liability related to any
existing equity grants made by any London Party to any of the
Business Employees.

  



  

(o) Unless a shorter period is specified, the provisions of this
Section 5.6 shall only apply from and after the date of this Agreement
until three (3) years after the Closing.

investigation thereof. The London Parties will furnish, and will cause the
Companies to furnish, to the New York Parties such additional financial
and operating data and other information as the New York Parties may

(c) Each Party shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the other
Parties and not to otherwise cause any unreasonable interference with the
prompt and timely discharge by the employees of the other Party of their
normal duties. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.7,
no Party shall be required to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to, grant
access or furnish information to any other Party or any of its
representatives (i) to the extent that such information is subject to an
attorney-client or attorney-work-product privilege, (ii) if such access or
the furnishing of such information is prohibited by applicable Law (including
the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws) or an existing contract or agreement,
(iii) if such access would result in damage to such party or (iv) if such
access is for purposes of performing any onsite procedure or investigation
that includes sampling or testing; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the case
of (i) or (ii), the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to make
appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure under
such circumstances.

effective, as promptly as practicable, the Transactions and the other

Governmental Bodies) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Body, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to
obtain all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties under
any Contract; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall be required to

material accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party to obtain
any such consent, approval or waiver), (iii) defend any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this

of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, New York shall not be
prohibited under this Section 5.8(a) from taking any action permitted by

(b) Nothing in this Section 5.8 shall require any Party to (i)
consent to any action or omission by any other Party that would be
inconsistent with this Section 5.8, absent such consent, or (ii) agree to
amend or waive any provision of this Agreement, or take or agree to any
actions that would reasonably be expected to result in a London Burdensome
Condition or a New York Burdensome Condition.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary,
reasonable best efforts on the part of London and its Affiliates, including
with respect to the matters contemplated by this Section 5.8, Section 5.9,
Section 5.10, and Section 5.11, shall not require London or any of its
Affiliates to agree to or accept a London Burdensome Condition.

Section 5.9 _Regulatory Approvals_.

  



  

(a) Except for the filings and notifications made pursuant to the
Premerger Notification Rules or other applicable Antitrust Laws to
which Section 5.9(b), and not this Section 5.9(a), shall apply, the parties
shall proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate Governmental Bodies

Transactions and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
promptly following the execution of this Agreement to the extent practicable,

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later
than sixty (60) calendar days (assuming the parties to this Agreement have
received from the other Party all the information required to make all of
their premerger notification filings) following the execution of this
Agreement, the Parties shall make all premerger notification filings pursuant
to the pre-merger notification rules under the HSR Act and other antitrust
and competition Laws (the " _Premerger Notification Rules_ "), including the
antitrust filing with the PRC and Taiwan antitrust authorities. Each of New
York and London shall (i) cooperate fully with each other and shall furnish
to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other
may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any filings
under any Premerger Notification Rules; (ii) keep the other Party
reasonably informed of any communication received by such party from, or
given by such Party to any Antitrust Authority, and of any
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding the Transactions and in a manner that
protects attorney-client or attorney-work-product privilege; and (iii) permit
the other party to review and incorporate the other Party's reasonable
comments in any communication given by it to any Antitrust Authority or in
connection with any proceeding by a private party related to Antitrust Laws
with any other Person, in each case regarding the Transactions and in a manner
that protects attorney-client or attorney-work-product privilege. Unless
otherwise agreed and without limiting the obligations stated in this Section
5.9, New York and London shall each use its reasonable best efforts to ensure
the prompt expiration of any applicable waiting period under any Premerger
Notification Rules or approval by the relevant Antitrust Authority. Further,
without limiting the obligations stated in this Section 5.9, New York and
London shall each use its reasonable best efforts to respond to and
comply promptly and expeditiously achieve substantial compliance with any
request for information regarding the Transactions or filings under any
Premerger Notification Rules from any Governmental Body charged with
enforcing, applying, administering, or investigating any, Antitrust Laws.
Neither Party shall initiate any meeting or substantive discussion with any
Governmental Body with respect to any filings, applications, investigation,
or other inquiry regarding the Transactions or filings under any Premerger
Notification Rules without giving the other Party reasonable prior notice of
the meeting or discussion and, to the extent appropriate, the opportunity to
attend and participate (which, at the request of either Party, shall be
limited to outside antitrust counsel only). Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, neither New York nor London shall have any obligation to
divest any asset(s) or business to secure antitrust clearance of the
Transactions, including but not limited to (i) selling or otherwise disposing
of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets,
categories of assets or businesses of London or New York or their
respective Subsidiaries or (ii) terminating any joint venture or other
similar arrangement (each, a " _Divestiture Action_ "). The Parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to share information protected from disclosure under
the attorney-client privilege, work-product doctrine, joint defense privilege
or any other privilege pursuant to this Section 5.9(b) so as to preserve any
applicable privilege.

  



  

(c) None of the Parties or their respective Affiliates shall take
any action with the intention to, or that could reasonably be expected to,
hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or any necessary approval of any
Antitrust Authority under a Premerger Notification Rule or Antitrust Law or
the expiration of the required waiting period under the Premerger Notification
Rules or any other Antitrust Law.

in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to satisfy the CFIUS
Condition, including: (a) reasonably promptly after the date hereof, making
any draft and final notification under FINSA in connection with the CFIUS

additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith) and in
connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any
Governmental Body under FINSA with respect to any such filing or any such
transaction. Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to
each other Party all information required for any application or other filing

contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
each Party shall promptly inform the other Parties of any oral communication
with, and provide copies of written communications with, any Governmental Body
regarding any such filings or any such transaction. No Party shall
independently participate in any formal meeting with any Governmental Body in
respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry without giving the
other Parties sufficient prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Body, the opportunity to attend and/or
participate in such meeting. Subject to applicable Law, the Parties will
consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party relating
to proceedings under FINSA. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the New
York Parties and London Parties shall take such actions and agree to such
requirements or conditions to mitigate any national security concerns as may
be requested or required by CFIUS in connection with, or as a condition of,
the satisfaction of the CFIUS Condition; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding anything else contained herein, the provisions of this
Section 5.10 shall not be construed to require either New York or the
London Group Companies (i) to implement any Divestiture Action or (ii) to
agree to any other term or take or consent to any other action in connection
with the satisfaction of the CFIUS Condition (x) that, in the case of clause
(ii), is not conditioned upon consummation of the Transactions or (y) would
reasonably be expected to result in, respectively, a London Burdensome
Condition or a New York Burdensome Condition.

(2) years after the Closing, each of the Parties shall use their reasonable
best efforts to obtain the approvals and consents they were responsible for
obtaining (or submitting an application to obtain) prior to or after the
Closing and assist in any filings for which they are responsible, in each case
as such approvals, consents and filings are required of them in connection
with the Transactions and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and are requested by the other Party and that have not been previously
obtained or made; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall be required to
make any material payments, incur any material Liability or offer or grant any
material accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party to obtain
any such consent or approval and in no event shall London or any of its
Affiliates be obligated to provide any guarantee or other credit support to
New York and its Affiliates (including the Companies) in connection therewith.

issue any such press release or make any such written public statement prior
to such consultation, except (a) as the New York Parties or the London Parties

pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange (in
which case such party will, to the extent practicable, promptly inform the
other Parties in writing in advance of such compelled disclosure), (b) with

not yet filed for any taxable period that begins before the Closing Date
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices employed by
London or New York, as the case may be (except to the extent that tax
advisors for London or New York, as relevant, conclude that there is no
reasonable basis in Law therefor or determine that a Tax Return cannot be so
prepared and filed without being subject to penalties). With respect to any
such Tax Return required to be filed by London or New York under this Section
5.13 with respect to Income Taxes, the other Party shall be provided with a
copy of such Tax Return, together with appropriate supporting information and

(but, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any Taxes imposed upon the net
income, gross income or capital gains of a transferor) (such Taxes, "
_Transfer Taxes_ ") and any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses payable in
connection with the conveyance, transfer and assignment of the Subject Shares
and the Taiwan Restructuring, in each case, pursuant to this Agreement. To
the extent required by PRC Law, London shall file or cause the filing of a Tax
Return to the PRC tax authority with respect to the transfer of shares in

of a written request therefor, reimburse London for its share of any such
Transfer Taxes and any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation and filing of such Tax Returns. The London
Parties and the New York Parties shall cooperate in using reasonable best
efforts to minimize any applicable Transfer Taxes.

and such treatment shall govern for purposes hereof except to the extent that
the Laws of a particular jurisdiction provide otherwise. In the event that any
such payments may be taxable to the recipient under applicable Law, such
payments shall be made in an amount sufficient to indemnify the relevant party
on an after-Tax basis.

  



  

(c) All payments payable under any tax sharing agreement or
arrangement between London and the Companies for any taxable period ending on
or prior to the Closing Date shall be calculated on a basis consistent with
past practice and shall be payable in full prior to the Closing. Any such tax
sharing agreement or arrangement between London and the Companies shall be
terminated prior to the Closing.

  



  

Section 5.16 _Condition to Transfer of Certain Contracts and
Rights._ Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that in the Taiwan Restructuring or any other part of
the Transactions, London is not assigning to London Taiwan NewCo Sub
any Taiwan Contract, any Contract listed in Section 3.21 or other right which
by its terms requires the consent of any other party unless such consent has
been obtained prior to such contribution. With respect to each such unassigned
Taiwan Contract, Contract listed in Section 3.21 or right, for two (2) years
after the Closing, London shall continue as the prime contracting party
and, if requested by the New York Parties, each Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of all required parties to the

Contract, Contract listed in Section 3.21 or right accruing after the Closing
to the extent that London may provide London Taiwan NewCo Sub with such
benefits without violating applicable Law or the terms of such Taiwan
Contract, Contract listed in Section 3.21 or right; _provided_ , _however_ ,

Affiliates' payment and performance obligations under any such Contract or
right except for their negligence or willful misconduct, and such

Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the intercompany obligations described

other hand, in connection with the Taiwan Restructuring.

Section 5.25 _Transaction Litigation_. From and after the date of
this Agreement until the Closing, each of New York and London shall promptly
notify the other of any action commenced or, to the knowledge of the New York
Parties or to the knowledge of the London Parties, as the case may be,
threatened against such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or
otherwise relating to, involving or affecting such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, in each case in connection with, arising from or
otherwise relating to the Transactions and any other transaction contemplated
hereby (such an action, a " _Transaction Litigation_ "). New York and London
shall give each other the opportunity to participate in, but not control, the
defense, settlement and prosecution of any Transaction Litigation and shall
keep the other informed on a prompt basis with respect thereto (including by
promptly providing any material communication received or given in connection
with any such proceeding). Notwithstanding any other provision of

any Transaction Litigation without the prior written consent of the other

necessary in order to obtain the land use rights grant certificates with

London Disclosure Letter). London shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the land use certificates with respect to all such London PRC Real
Property and building ownership certificates with respect to the PRC
Buildings prior to Closing. If London does not obtain any such land use or
building ownership certificates prior to Closing, London shall continue to
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such certificates after the Closing
until two (2) years after the Closing.

  



  

Section 5.27 _Trademark Licenses_.

  



  

(a) The New York Parties, London PRC Sub, London U.S. Sub and London
Taiwan NewCo Sub (collectively, the " _Trademark Licensees_ ") shall have the
right to use the names and marks set forth in Section 5.27(a) of the London
Disclosure Letter in connection with the operation of the Business for a
period of up to eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date. After such
18-month period, the Trademark Licensees shall discontinue all use of any
such names and marks and any Trademarks related thereto or containing or
comprising such names, including any confusingly similar or dilutive
variations thereof (the " _London Marks_ "). In furtherance thereof, as soon
as practicable, but in no event later than eighteen (18) months following the
Closing Date, New York shall cause each of the Trademark Licensees to remove,
strike over, or otherwise obliterate all London Marks from all assets and
other materials owned by any Trademark Licensees, including any vehicles,
business cards, schedules, stationery, packaging materials, displays, signs,
promotional materials, manuals, forms, websites, email, computer software and
other materials and systems. All goodwill generated by the Trademark
Licensees' use of the London Marks pursuant to this Section 5.27 shall inure
to the benefit of London and its Subsidiaries. The Trademark Licensees agree
to use the London Marks in a form and manner, and with quality standards, of
that in effect for the London Marks as of the Closing Date. Nothing in this
paragraph shall be construed to limit London's ability to use the London
Marks in any way following the Closing Date. The New York Parties (on behalf
of themselves and the other Trademark Licensees) represent and warrant that
the Trademark Licensees will not contest ownership, validity or
enforceability of the London Marks. The Trademark Licensees shall not use the
London Marks in a manner that may reflect negatively on such name and marks
or on London. London shall have the right to terminate the foregoing license
if any of the Trademark Licensees fail to comply with the foregoing terms and
conditions or otherwise fail to comply with any reasonable direction of London
in relation to the use of the London Marks, and such failure cannot be cured
or, if curable, is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice of
such failure is given to New York. The Trademark Licensees shall indemnify and
hold harmless London and its Affiliates for any Indemnified Amounts arising
from or relating to the use by the Trademark Licensees of the London Marks
pursuant to this Section 5.27. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees
that the remedy at Law for any breach of the requirements of this
Section 5.27 would be inadequate and agrees and consents that without
intending to limit any additional remedies that may be available, London
shall be entitled to a temporary or permanent injunction, without proof of
actual damage or inadequacy of legal remedy, and without posting any bond or
other undertaking, in any claim, action, suit, litigation or other proceeding
which may be brought to enforce any of the provisions of this Section 5.27.

(b) Pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this Section
5.27(b) and Section 5.27(c), from and after Closing, London hereby
grants, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to grant, to the Trademark
Licensees, and the Trademark Licensees agree to accept, a worldwide, fully-
paid up, royalty-free, nonexclusive license to the names and marks set forth
in Section 5.27(b) of the London Disclosure Letter (" _Globalprene Marks_ ")
to use in connection with the Business (the " _Globalprene License_ "). The
Trademark Licensees agree to use the Globalprene Marks consistent with the
form and manner, and with quality standards, of that in effect for the
Globalprene Marks as of the Closing Date or as otherwise reasonably directed
by London from time to time. The Parties agree that except as expressly set
forth in this Section 5.27, London retains all right, title and interest in,
to and under the Globalprene Marks and London and its Affiliates may assign
or license the Globalprene Marks to any Affiliate or non-Affiliate of London;
_provided_ , that, during the term of the Globalprene License, any such non-
Affiliate assignee or non-Affiliate licensee agrees not to use the
Globalprene Marks in connection with its conduct of any business of
researching, producing and selling styrenic block copolymers (except to the
extent such conduct is on behalf of London or any of its Affiliates). All
goodwill generated by the Trademark Licensees' use of the Globalprene Marks
pursuant to this Section 5.27 shall inure to the benefit of London and its
Affiliates. The New York Parties (on behalf of themselves and the other
Trademark Licensees) agree that the Trademark Licensees will not contest the
ownership, validity or enforceability of the Globalprene Marks. New York
agrees that the Trademark Licensees will not use the Globalprene Marks in a
manner that may reflect negatively on such name and marks. The Parties agree
that upon the reasonable request, and at the cost and expense, of any of the
Trademark Licensees, London shall use reasonable efforts to procure that the
Globalprene License be duly registered with the relevant authorities to the
extent required by applicable Laws.

  



  

(c) The Parties agree that the term of the Globalprene License will
be for an initial period of fifteen (15) years following the Closing Date.
The Parties agree that during such fifteen (15) year period, the license shall
be irrevocable; _provided_ , _however_ , the license shall terminate if the
Trademark Licensees cease to use the Globalprene Marks for a period of five
(5) consecutive years or if any of the Trademark Licensees fail to comply
with the terms and conditions set forth herein or otherwise fail to
comply with any reasonable direction of London in relation to the use of the
Globalprene Marks, and such failure cannot be cured or, if curable, is not
cured within thirty (30) days after written notice of such failure is given to
New York. The Parties agree that after such fifteen (15) year period, the
remaining term of the Globalprene License shall be determined as follows: (i)
if London (or any of its Affiliates) beneficially owns 10% or more of the
issued and outstanding shares of UK Holdco Common Stock, the Parties may
extend the term of the license, by mutual agreement not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed for a five (5) year term and successive five
(5) year terms thereafter, and (ii) if London (or any of its Affiliates)
beneficially owns less than 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of UK
Holdco Common Stock, the license term will be automatically extended for five
(5) additional years and will then terminate. The Parties agree the
Globalprene License includes the right of New York to request that London
register the Globalprene Marks in additional countries at New York's cost and
expense, subject to London's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) and for clarity, London shall retain
ownership of the Globalprene Marks. The Trademark Licensees shall indemnify
and hold harmless London and its Affiliates for any Indemnified
Amounts arising from or relating to the use by the Trademark Licensees of the
Globalprene Marks pursuant to this Section 5.27. Each of the Parties
acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at Law for any breach of the
requirements of this Section 5.27 would be inadequate and agrees and consents
that without intending to limit any additional remedies that may be available,
London shall be entitled to a temporary or permanent injunction, without
proof of actual damage or inadequacy of legal remedy, and without posting any
bond or other undertaking, in any claim, action, suit, litigation or other
proceeding which may be brought to enforce any of the provisions of this
Section 5.27.

exclusive, worldwide, fully-paid up, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable
license to all know-how primarily used in or relating to the Business to
make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, export, reproduce, and
prepare derivative works in connection with the conduct of any of the London
Businesses (" _Licensed Field of Use_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, London and its Affiliates (and each of their
sublicensees and successors and assigns) shall retain the right to use
information in non-tangible form that is included in the London Intellectual
Property Rights and retained in the memories of London's or its Affiliates'
employees, contractors or agents who have had access to London Intellectual
Property prior to the Closing Date, and New York and its Affiliates shall
have the right to use information in non-tangible form relating to
Intellectual Property not primarily used in or relating to the Business and
retained in the memories of any Assumed Employees who have had access to any
such Intellectual Property prior to the Closing Date. For purposes of this
Section 5.28, " _London Businesses_ " shall mean the businesses of London as
conducted by London and its Affiliates immediately following the Closing.

  



  

(b) London and its Affiliates may grant one or more sublicenses
under the license granted to London and its Affiliates pursuant to
Section 5.28(a); _provided_ , _however_ , that London and its Affiliates
shall not grant any sublicenses under such license to any unaffiliated third
party without New York's prior written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Any sublicense granted under
this Agreement must (i) be consistent with the terms of this Agreement and
(ii) be limited to the Licensed Field of Use. London shall be jointly and
severally liable to New York for any breach of this Agreement or
any sublicense by any sublicensee. Each sublicense shall provide that the
sublicense shall automatically terminate if the sublicensee uses the licensed
know-how outside of the Licensed Field of Use and the sublicensee fails to
cure such breach within thirty (30) days of London providing the sublicensee
with written notice of such breach.

(c) London and its Affiliates may transfer the license granted to
London and its Affiliates pursuant to Section 5.28(a) in whole or in part to
a successor that has acquired substantially all of the applicable London
business to which the transferred license relates. Succession shall include,
but shall not be limited to, acquisition, merger, change of corporate name, or
change in the make-up, organization or identity of London and its Affiliates.
The transferee shall also be subject to all of the conditions stated in this
license. London shall notify New York in writing within thirty (30) days after
such a transfer occurs. New York may, at its discretion, require that a new
license be signed by the successor; _provided_ , that any such new license
shall be consistent with, and shall include terms no more restrictive with
respect to the applicable successor than, the terms set forth herein.

  



  

Section 5.29 _Wrong Pockets_. For a period of two (2) years
following the Closing Date, in the event that, at any time, or from time to
time, London or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand (the " _London Wrong
Pocket Entities_ "), or UK Holdco, New York, any Company or any of their
respective Affiliates, on the other hand (the " _New York Wrong Pocket
Entities_ " and together with the London Wrong Pocket Entities, the "
_Discovering Entity_ "), shall become aware that (a) any New York Wrong Pocket
Entity has received or possesses any Intellectual Property, tangible
embodiments thereof or IP Contract that is not primarily used in or related
to the Business (collectively, the " _London Wrong Pockets Assets_ ") or (b)
that any London Wrong Pocket Entity possesses any Intellectual Property,
tangible embodiments thereof or IP Contract that is primarily used in or
related to the Business (including London Intellectual Property in Progress)
(collectively, the " _New York Wrong Pockets Assets_ "), UK Holdco (if the
Discovering Entity is a New York Wrong Pocket Entity) and London (if
the Discovering Entity is a London Wrong Pocket Entity) shall provide London

the Discovering Entity is a London Wrong Pocket Entity), respectively, with
written notice thereof. Promptly following delivery of such notice, UK
Holdco, in the case of any London Wrong Pockets Assets, and London, in the
case of any New York Wrong Pockets Assets, shall cause the applicable New York
Wrong Pocket Entity or London Wrong Pocket Entity, respectively, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly transfer, or cause to be
transferred, the applicable London Wrong Pockets Asset to London or its
designated Affiliate or the applicable New York Wrong Pockets Asset to UK
Holdco or its designated Affiliate, as applicable. Prior to any such transfer,

relationships and affiliations that each London Designee has to London and
its Affiliates that have been disclosed at any time prior to the Closing in

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty, except for Section

(d) any Liabilities of New York and its Affiliates (including the
Companies) based on acts or omissions occurring after the Closing and related
to the Business as conducted by New York and its Affiliates (including the
Companies);

  



  

except to the extent such Indemnified Amounts arise out of or result from a
matter for which indemnification would be provided under Section 6.1.

  



  

Section 6.3 _Survival; Threshold and Limits of Liability_.

  



  

(a) The representations and warranties of the Parties contained in
this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the date that is fifteen (15)
months after the Closing Date, and all liability of the Parties with respect
to covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement that by their terms
are to be performed at or prior to the Closing shall terminate on such date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the representations and warranties of the
Parties contained in Section 3.13 and Section 4.13 shall survive the
Closing until the date that is three (3) years after the Closing Date; (ii)
the representations and warranties of the Parties contained in Section 3.10
and Section 4.10 shall survive the Closing until the expiration of the statute
of limitations applicable to the matters provided for within such sections;

of limitations applicable to contracts under seal in the State of Delaware;
and (iv) any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that provides
for performance after the Closing shall survive in accordance with its terms
(or, if no period is stated therein, then shall survive indefinitely);
_provided_ , _however_ , that any claim presented for indemnification under
this Article VI for any breach or nonfulfillment of any such post-Closing
covenant or agreement must be brought within three (3) years of such breach
or nonfulfillment (except in the event this Agreement provides for a shorter
period, in such case, such shorter period). The applicable time period for
which a provision survives as provided in this Section 6.3 is referred to as
the " _Survival Period_." The Parties agree that no claims or causes of
action may be brought against any Party based upon, directly or indirectly,
any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement after the applicable Survival Period set forth in this Section
6.3, _provided_ , that no claim presented for indemnification pursuant to
this Article VI prior to the expiration of its Survival Period shall be
affected in any way by the expiration of such Survival Period.

  



  

(b) The London Parties shall not be required to indemnify or hold
harmless the New York Indemnified Parties for any Indemnified Amounts arising
under Section 6.1(a) (other than with respect to breaches of the Category 2
London Representations, as to which the Threshold Amount shall not apply)
unless the aggregate Indemnified Amount for which the London Parties are
obligated to indemnify the New York Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section
6.1(a) exceeds the Threshold Amount. In the event such aggregate Indemnified
Amount exceeds the Threshold Amount, the indemnification obligations of the
London Parties pursuant to Section 6.1(a) shall apply only to those
Indemnified Amounts sustained by the New York Indemnified Parties in excess of
the Threshold Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the London Parties shall
not be required to indemnify or hold harmless the New York Indemnified Parties
for any individual item (or series of items arising from the same facts and
circumstances) arising under Section 6.1(a) if the respective
Indemnified Amount is less than $225,000 (the " _De Minimis Threshold_ "),
and any such items below the De Minimis Threshold shall not be taken into
account in determining whether the Threshold Amount has been exceeded or
otherwise for purposes of indemnification hereunder. In no event shall the
London Parties' aggregate liability to the New York Indemnified Parties under
Section 6.1(a) (other than with respect to breaches of the Category 2 London
Representations, as to which the Ceiling Amount shall not apply) exceed the
Ceiling Amount.

(c) No New York Party shall be required to indemnify or hold
harmless the London Indemnified Parties for any Indemnified Amounts
arising under Section 6.2(a) (other than with respect to breaches of the
Category 2 New York Representations, as to which the Threshold Amount shall
not apply) unless the aggregate Indemnified Amount for which the New York
Parties are obligated to indemnify the London Indemnified Parties pursuant to
Section 6.2(a) exceeds the Threshold Amount. In the event such aggregate
Indemnified Amount exceeds the Threshold Amount, the indemnification
obligations of the New York Parties pursuant to Section 6.2(a) shall apply
only to those Indemnified Amounts sustained by the London Indemnified Parties
in excess of the Threshold Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the New
York Parties shall not be required to indemnify or hold harmless the London
Indemnified Parties for any individual item (or series of items arising from
the same facts and circumstances) arising under Section 6.2(a) if the
respective Indemnified Amount is less than the De Minimis Threshold, and any
such items below the De Minimis Threshold shall not be taken into account in
determining whether the Threshold Amount has been exceeded or otherwise for
purposes of indemnification hereunder. In no event shall the New York
Parties' aggregate liability to the London Indemnified Parties under Section
6.2(a) (other than with respect to breaches of the Category 2 New York
Representations, as to which the Ceiling Amount shall not apply) exceed the
Ceiling Amount.

  



  

(d) For purposes of this Article VI, the existence of any breach or
inaccuracy of a representation or warranty, and the calculation of any
Indemnified Amount in respect thereof, shall be determined without giving
effect as to any qualification contained in such representation and warranty
as to materiality, including London Material Adverse Effect or New York
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 6.4 _Indemnification Procedures_. All claims for
indemnification under this Agreement shall be asserted and resolved as
follows:

  



  

(a) Promptly (and in any event within fifteen (15) calendar days)
after receipt by a Person entitled to indemnity under Section 6.1 or
Section 6.2 (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") of notice of the assertion of a
claim against an Indemnified Party by a Person that is not a party to this
Agreement (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall give
notice in writing, and in reasonable detail, to the Person obligated to
indemnify under such Section (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the assertion
of such Third-Party Claim (except that the Indemnifying Party or Parties shall
not be liable for any expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in defending
such Third-Party Claim during the period in which the Indemnified Party failed
to give such notice); _provided_ , that the failure to notify the
Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability
that it may have to any Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense of such Third-Party Claim is
materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to give such notice.
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party,
promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) after the
Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the
Third-Party Claim.

  



    

111 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) If an Indemnified Party gives notice to the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to the preceding paragraph of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled (but shall not be required) to
participate in, assume, control the defense of and settle such Third-Party
Claim at such Indemnifying Party's own cost and expense and with counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. After notice from the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the
defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, so long
as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Party
under this Article VI for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with
respect to the defense of such Third-Party Claim, in each case subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such
Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-
Party Claim, (i) such assumption will establish a rebuttable presumption for
purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that Third-Party Claim are
within the scope of and subject to indemnification, and (ii) no compromise or
settlement of such Third-Party Claims may be effected by the Indemnifying
Party without the Indemnified Party's consent unless (A) there is no finding
or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of
any Person; (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in
full by the Indemnifying Party; and (C) the Indemnified Party shall have no
liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such Third-Party
Claims effected without its consent. If notice is given to an Indemnifying
Party of the assertion of any Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party
does not, within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Indemnified Party's
notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Party of its election to
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be
bound by any determination made in such Third-Party Claim or any compromise
or settlement effected by the Indemnified Party.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) there exists a conflict of
interest or potential conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party
and the applicable Indemnified Party, (ii) a Third-Party Claim seeks an
order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief for damages other than
monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement or (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not have employed counsel to
represent the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) Business Days after notice
from the Indemnified Party of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party
may, by notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume the exclusive right
to defend, compromise or settle such Third-Party Claim, but the Indemnifying
Party will not be bound by any determination of any Third-Party Claim so
defended for the purposes of this Agreement or any compromise or settlement
effected without its consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned).

  



  

(d) With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification
under this Article VI: (i) both the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, shall keep the other Person fully
informed of the status of such Third-Party Claim and any related
proceedings at all stages thereof, and (ii) the Parties agree (each at its
own expense) to render to each other such assistance as they may reasonably
require of each other and to cooperate in good faith with each other in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any Third-Party Claim,
including, subject to Section 6.4(e), making available to the Party assuming
control of the defense all witnesses, pertinent and material information and
materials in such Party's possession or under such Party's control relating
thereto as are reasonably required by such Party controlling the defense.

  



    

112 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(e) With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification
under this Article VI, the Parties agree to cooperate in such a manner as to
preserve in full (to the extent possible) the confidentiality of all
confidential information and the attorney-client and work-product privileges.
In connection therewith, each Party agrees that: (i) it will use its
reasonable best efforts, in respect of any Third-Party Claim in which it has
assumed or participated in the defense, to avoid production of Confidential
Information (consistent with applicable Law and rules of procedure), and (ii)
all communications between any Party and counsel responsible for or
participating in the defense of any Third-Party Claim shall, to the extent
possible, be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-
product privilege.

  



  

(f) If any Indemnified Party has determined that any matter has
given rise to a claim against any Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not
involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall transmit to the
Indemnifying Party a written notice (the " _Indemnity Notice_ ") describing
in reasonable detail the nature of the claim, an estimate of the amount of
damages attributable to such claim to the extent feasible (which estimate
shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim), and the
provisions of this Agreement that are the basis of the Indemnified Party's
request for indemnification under this Agreement. Such Indemnified Party
shall provide an Indemnity Notice within sixty (60) Business Days (the "
_Notice Period_ ") of (in the case of New York) its chief executive officer,
chief financial officer or general counsel or (in the case of London) its
president or principal legal officer determining that such party will or is
likely to assert such claim. Failure to notify the Indemnifying Party within
the Notice Period will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it
may have to any Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party demonstrates that the liability claimed in such Indemnity Notice
increased during the period between the end of the Notice Period and the date
on which such Indemnity Notice was transmitted to the Indemnifying Party. For
thirty (30) Business Days from and after receipt of the Indemnity Notice, the
Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its officers,
attorneys, accountants and other representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours to the Indemnified Party's offices, personnel,
properties, equipment and records for the purpose of conducting an
investigation of the matter identified in the Indemnity Notice. The
Indemnified Party shall furnish the Indemnifying Party with such
additional information as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request,
subject to the other provisions of this Section 6.4. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this paragraph, no Party shall be required to, or to
cause any of its Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish information to any
other Party or any of its Representatives (i) to the extent that such
information is subject to an attorney-client or attorney-work-product
privilege, (ii) if such access or the furnishing of such information is
prohibited by applicable Law (including the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws)
or an existing contract or agreement or (iii) if such access or the
furnishing of such information would result in damage to such Party,
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of (i) or (ii), the Parties shall
use reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to
permit reasonable disclosure under such circumstances. If the Indemnifying
Party does not deliver a written response within thirty (30) Business Days of
receipt of the Indemnity Notice disputing such claim, the claim identified
therein shall be deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party and shall be
paid promptly.

Section 6.5 _General_.

  



  

(a) No New York Party nor any London Party shall have any right to
set off any Indemnified Amounts against any other payments to be made by
either of them under this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Any liability for indemnification under this Agreement shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of any state of facts
(i) giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or (ii) taken into account in
determining any adjustment to the consideration payable under Article II of
this Agreement. In no event shall any Party be liable under this Article VI
or otherwise in respect of this Agreement for exemplary, punitive,
speculative or remote damages, except to the extent incurred to an un-
Affiliated third party in connection with a Third-Party Claim, in which event
such damages shall be recoverable.

  



  

(c) The Parties agree that, following the Closing, the sole and
exclusive remedy of any Party to this Agreement, any New York
Indemnified Party or any London Indemnified Party or their respective
Affiliates with respect to this Agreement or any other claims relating to the
Business, the Conveyance Properties or the Subject Shares, the events giving
rise to this Agreement and the Transactions and other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or by any other such claims relating to the
Business, Conveyance Properties or Subject Shares, in each case other than
with respect to (i) covenants that by their terms are to be performed after
Closing (which may also be specifically enforced pursuant to Section 9.1(b))
and (ii) claims of, and causes of action arising from, fraud, shall be
limited to the indemnification provisions set forth in Section 5.15, Section
5.16, Section 5.18(c), Section 5.27 and this Article VI and, in furtherance
of the foregoing, each of the Parties, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,
waives and releases the other Parties to this Agreement (and such other
Parties' Affiliates) from, to the fullest extent permitted under
any applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it or its
Affiliates may have against the other Parties to this Agreement except as
aforesaid and as provided by this Agreement.

  



  

(d) The Parties intend that, even though indemnification obligations
appear in various sections and articles of this Agreement, the
indemnification procedures and limitations contained in this Article VI shall
apply to all indemnity obligations of the Parties under this
Agreement, except to the extent expressly excluded in this Article VI.

  



  

(e) The indemnification provisions in this Article VI shall be
enforceable regardless of whether any Person (including the Person from whom
indemnification is sought) alleges or proves the sole, concurrent,
contributory or comparative negligence of the Person seeking indemnification
or the sole or concurrent strict liability imposed upon the Person seeking
indemnification. The rights of the Parties to indemnification under this
Article VI shall not be limited due to (i) any investigations heretofore or
hereafter made by such Parties or their representatives, regardless of
negligence in the conduct of any such investigations or (ii) the knowledge of
any Party of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
by another Party at any time, or the decision of any Party to complete the
Closing. All representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by the
Parties shall not be deemed merged into any instruments or agreements
delivered in connection with the Closing or otherwise in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.6 _Retention of Records_. Notwithstanding anything else
in this Agreement to the contrary, (a) before and after the Closing, all
records of London relating to the negotiation and consummation by London of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Shareholder Agreement
and all records of London prepared in connection with the potential
divestiture or conveyance of all or part of the Business, including
confidential communications with financial and other advisors and legal
counsel representing London or its Affiliates (including the Companies) shall
be owned and retained by London and its Affiliates after the Closing; (b)
before and after the Closing, all rights and privileges of London and its
Affiliates and the Companies relating to the negotiation and consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Shareholder Agreement,
including the right to assert or waive the attorney-client privilege, shall
be retained and owned by London and its Affiliates after the Closing; (c)
London shall be entitled, in perpetuity, to control the assertion or waiver
of all privileges, including the attorney-client privilege, in connection with
privileged information in London's records that relates solely to the subject
matter of any claims constituting Excluded Liabilities (including the matters
set forth on Section 6.1(e) of the London Disclosure Letter), now pending or
which may be asserted in the future, in any lawsuits or other proceedings
initiated against or by London, whether or not the privileged information is
in the possession of or under the control of London (or its Affiliates) or
New York (or its Affiliates, including the Companies); and (d) in no
event shall any New York Party or the Companies have any right to assert or
waive any of the London rights and privileges set forth in clause (b) and (c)
related to London documents and, from and after the Closing, the New York
Parties shall cause the Companies not to assert or waive such rights and
privileges; it being acknowledged that nothing in this Section 6.6 grants
London any right with respect to records, rights or privileges belonging to
New York or its Affiliates, including any right to assert or waive
the attorney-client privilege.

connection with this Agreement (including the exhibits hereto, the
disclosure letters delivered in connection herewith, and the Ancillary
Agreements), aside from disputes arising out of Section 2.8 hereof (which
disputes shall be subject to the dispute resolution provisions stated in
Section 2.9), shall be brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (the " _Court of Chancery_ ") or, if the Court of Chancery does not

extent permitted by applicable Law, and agrees not to assert, by way of

with respect to this Agreement in such court, any claim that the suit, action
or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the
venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper, or that this Agreement,
or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such court
pursuant to this Section 9.1.

  



  

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement (including the
exhibits hereto, the Disclosure Letters delivered in connection herewith, and
the Ancillary Agreements) were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that, to prevent breaches or threatened breaches by the
Parties of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled in law or in equity. In connection
with any request for specific performance or equitable relief by any Party,
each of the other Parties waive any requirement for the security or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy.

  



  

(c) Each Party hereby waives its right to trial by jury in
connection with any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.2 _Fees and Expenses_.

  



  

(a) Except as provided below, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Transactions shall be paid by the Party incurring
such fees or expenses, whether or not the Transactions are consummated.

  



  

(b) New York shall pay to London a fee of $25,000,000 (the " _New
York Termination Fee_ ") if: (i) New York terminates this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1(c)(i); (ii) London terminates this Agreement pursuant to (A)
Section 8.1(d)(i) and no London Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred
after the date of this Agreement and be continuing at the time of the New York
Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) Section 8.1(d)(ii); or (iii) (A) prior
to the New York Stockholder Meeting, any Person publicly makes a bona fide
New York Acquisition Proposal that is not withdrawn, (B) this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) or Section 8.1(b)(iii) and (C)
within twelve (12) months of the End Date or the date of such New York
Stockholder Meeting, as applicable, New York enters into a definitive
Contract to consummate, or consummates, the transactions contemplated by any
New York Acquisition Proposal (for purposes of this Section 9.2(b), the term
" _New York Acquisition Proposal_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such
term in Section 5.1(h)(i), except that all references to "20%" shall be
changed to "50%"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event New York pays
the Expenses pursuant to Section 9.2(c) and later is obligated to pay the New
York Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.2(b)(iii), the amount payable by
New York pursuant to Section 9.2(b)(iii) shall equal the New York Termination

damages or seek any other remedy from New York (or its Affiliates) with
respect to the Transactions or the termination thereof, regardless of whether
such monetary damages or other remedies are based on a claim in law or equity,
and all such claims are hereby waived.

  



    

123 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by London or New
York pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii), then New York shall pay to London the
Expenses of London no later than three (3) Business Days after receipt
following termination of documentation supporting such Expenses.

  



  

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by London or New

Disclosure Letter.

  



  

(f) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the covenants
and obligations contained in this Section 9.2 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these covenants
and obligations, the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement and
that the New York Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the London Parties, in
the circumstances in which such New York Termination Fee is payable, for
the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

exhibits and schedules hereto, the Disclosure Letters delivered in connection
herewith and the Ancillary Agreements, constitutes the entire agreement of
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement, including the exhibits and schedules hereto, the Disclosure
Letters delivered in connection herewith and the Ancillary Agreements, may
not be modified, amended, altered or terminated except by a written instrument
specifically referring to this Agreement signed by all the Parties.

  



  

Section 9.4 _Waivers and Consents_. All waivers and consents given
hereunder shall be in writing. No waiver by any Party of any breach or
anticipated breach of any provision hereof by any other Party shall be deemed
a waiver of any other contemporaneous, preceding or succeeding breach or
anticipated breach, whether or not similar. Except as provided in this
Agreement, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any
investigation by or on behalf of any Party, shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance by any other Party with
any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement. The failure of any Party to assert any rights under this Agreement
or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.
