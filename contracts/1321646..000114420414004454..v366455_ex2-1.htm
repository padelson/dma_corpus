Allocation shall be negotiated in good faith prior to the Closing based upon estimates of the value of the consideration to be

under Section 338 of the Code), UK Holdco shall prepare and furnish to London a schedule that allocates among the assets of each
London Group Company the amount of consideration attributed to such London Group Company pursuant to the final Allocation, plus
the liabilities of such London Group Company (the &ldquo;<U>Tax Schedule</U>&rdquo;). Any subsequent adjustments to the amount
of consideration payable under this Agreement shall be reflected in the Allocation and the Tax Schedule in a manner consistent
with Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations thereunder. For all Tax purposes, UK Holdco and London agree that the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement shall be reported in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement, including the Allocation
and, to the extent relevant, the Tax Schedule, and that no Tax position will be taken that is inconsistent therewith in any Tax
Return, in any refund claim, in any litigation, or otherwise.</P>

of contingent liabilities); (b) London is able to pay, and has not suspended payment of, its respective debts or obligations in

6.2 (an &ldquo;<U>Indemnified Party</U>&rdquo;) of notice of the assertion of a claim against an Indemnified Party by a Person
that is not a party to this Agreement (a &ldquo;<U>Third-Party Claim</U>&rdquo;), such Indemnified Party shall give notice in writing,
and in reasonable detail, to the Person obligated to indemnify under such Section (an &ldquo;<U>Indemnifying Party</U>&rdquo;)
of the assertion of such Third-Party Claim (except that the Indemnifying Party or Parties shall not be liable for any expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party in defending such Third-Party Claim during the period in which the Indemnified Party failed to
give such notice); <U>provided</U>, that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the
defense of such Third-Party Claim is materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Party&rsquo;s failure to give such notice. Thereafter,
the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) after
the Indemnified Party&rsquo;s receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Party relating to the Third-Party Claim.</P>

an Indemnified Party gives notice to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to the preceding paragraph of the assertion of a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled (but shall not be required) to participate in, assume, control the defense of and
settle such Third-Party Claim at such Indemnifying Party&rsquo;s own cost and expense and with counsel reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnified Party. After notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense
of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, so long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified
Party under this Article VI for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Third-Party
Claim, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, (i) such assumption will establish a rebuttable presumption
for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that Third-Party Claim are within the scope of and subject to indemnification,
and (ii) no compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified
Party&rsquo;s consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of any
Person; (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party; and (C) the Indemnified
Party shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims effected without its consent.
If notice is given to an Indemnifying Party of the assertion of any Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party does not, within
fifteen (15) Business Days after the Indemnified Party&rsquo;s notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Party of its election
to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be bound by any determination made in such Third-Party
Claim or any compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnified Party.</P>

the applicable Indemnified Party, (ii) a Third-Party Claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief for damages
other than monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement or (iii) the Indemnifying Party
shall not have employed counsel to represent the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) Business Days after notice from the Indemnified
Party of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may, by notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume the exclusive right to
defend, compromise or settle such Third-Party Claim, but the Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any determination of any Third-Party
Claim so defended for the purposes of this Agreement or any compromise or settlement effected without its consent (which may not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).</P>

at all stages thereof, and (ii) the Parties agree (each at its own expense) to render to each other such assistance as they may
reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in good faith with each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense
of any Third-Party Claim, including, subject to Section 6.4(e), making available to the Party assuming control of the defense all

not involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written notice (the &ldquo;<U>Indemnity
Notice</U>&rdquo;) describing in reasonable detail the nature of the claim, an estimate of the amount of damages attributable to
such claim to the extent feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim), and the provisions
of this Agreement that are the basis of the Indemnified Party&rsquo;s request for indemnification under this Agreement. Such Indemnified
Party shall provide an Indemnity Notice within sixty (60) Business Days (the &ldquo;<U>Notice Period</U>&rdquo;) of (in the case
of New York) its chief executive officer, chief financial officer or general counsel or (in the case of London) its president or
principal legal officer determining that such party will or is likely to assert such claim. Failure to notify the Indemnifying
Party within the Notice Period will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may have to any Indemnified Party, except
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the liability claimed in such Indemnity Notice increased during the
period between the end of the Notice Period and the date on which such Indemnity Notice was transmitted to the Indemnifying Party.
For thirty (30) Business Days from and after receipt of the Indemnity Notice, the Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying
Party and its officers, attorneys, accountants and other representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
Indemnified Party&rsquo;s offices, personnel, properties, equipment and records for the purpose of conducting an investigation
of the matter identified in the Indemnity Notice. The Indemnified Party shall furnish the Indemnifying Party with such additional
information as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request, subject to the other provisions of this Section 6.4. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, no Party shall be required to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to, grant access
or furnish information to any other Party or any of its Representatives (i) to the extent that such information is subject to an
attorney-client or attorney-work-product privilege, (ii) if such access or the furnishing of such information is prohibited by
applicable Law (including the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws) or an existing contract or agreement or (iii) if such access or
the furnishing of such information would result in damage to such Party, <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that in the case of (i)
or (ii), the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure
under such circumstances. If the Indemnifying Party does not deliver a written response within thirty (30) Business Days of receipt
of the Indemnity Notice disputing such claim, the claim identified therein shall be deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party
and shall be paid promptly.</P>
