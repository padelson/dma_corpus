disputed by Seller (as determined by the Accountant) and the denominator of
which is the total amount in dispute submitted to arbitration. The balance of
such fees and expenses shall be paid by Buyer. The parties agree that the
purpose of the adjustment contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ with
respect to Net Working Capital is to measure the amount of changes in Net
Working Capital using the Agreed Accounting Principles, and such adjustment

methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or

available funds to an account designated by Buyer;

 

(ii) if (A) the Net Working Capital set forth on the Final Closing
Statement is greater than the Net Working Capital Upper Boundary or (B) the

Statement is less than or equal to the Net Working Capital Upper Boundary and
greater than or equal to the Net Working Capital Lower Boundary and (B) the

Amount, then neither Buyer nor Seller shall have any payment obligation
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ and the Adjustment Escrow Deposit shall
be released to Seller in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.5(g)(ii)_.

 

(g) _Adjustment Escrow_. Within five (5) days of the determination of the
Final Closing Statement, Buyer and Seller shall deliver a joint written

payable to Buyer pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.5(f)(i)_ and (ii) to Seller
the remaining Adjustment Escrow Deposit by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to accounts designated by Seller.

in this Agreement, except in the case of Fraud, (i) the process set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
parties hereto for any disputes related to items required to be included or
reflected in the calculation of Net Working Capital and Cash and (ii) Buyers
right to receive payment pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5(f)(i)_ shall be

with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except as may be required by applicable Law or by the rules of any
national securities exchange or stock market, in which case the party hereto
required to make the release or announcement shall allow the other party
hereto reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance
of such issuance; _provided_ that each of the parties hereto may make
internal announcements to their respective employees regarding the
transactions

 



-35- 

    

 contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing herein
shall prohibit or prevent Seller or any of its Affiliates from disclosing any
information of a nature that would typically be provided by companies to
their investors or prospective investors.

7.2 _Antitrust Approvals_.

(a) Seller and Buyer shall, as promptly as practicable and before the
expiration of any relevant legal deadline, but in no event later than four
(4) Business Days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
file, or cause to be filed, with (i) the United States Federal Trade
Commission and the DOJ the notification and report form required pursuant to
the HSR Act for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and provide
as promptly as practicable any supplemental information requested in
connection therewith, which forms shall specifically request
early termination of the waiting period prescribed by the HSR Act and (ii)
any other Governmental Entity, any other filings, reports, information and
documentation required for the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to
any Laws relating to antitrust and competition applicable to any Acquired
Company, if any ("Other Antitrust Laws"). Each of the parties hereto shall
furnish, or cause to be furnished, to each others counsel such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection
with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the
HSR Act and any Other Antitrust Laws. Buyer shall be responsible for all
filing fees payable in connection with such filings.

(b) Seller and Buyer shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
promptly obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act and any Other
Antitrust Laws for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall keep each other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from, any Governmental Entity and shall comply promptly with any such inquiry
or request. Buyer agrees to promptly take any and all steps necessary to avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity or any other party so as to enable the
parties to expeditiously close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting,
by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture
or disposition of any of its assets, properties or businesses or of the
assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by it pursuant to this
Agreement as are required to be divested, and (ii) otherwise taking or
committing to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit Buyers or
its Affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability to
retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of any
Acquired Company, in each case, as may be required in order to avoid the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution of, any preliminary or permanent injunction,
in any Suit under the HSR Act or any Other Antitrust Laws, which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, neither this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ nor
the "reasonable best efforts" standard shall require, or be construed to
require, Buyer to take any action with respect to any assets, properties,
businesses or product lines of Buyer, its Subsidiaries or the Acquired
Companies that, individually or taken together with any other actions, would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business,
financial condition, assets or operations of Buyer (together with its
Subsidiaries) or the Acquired Companies; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that
for purposes of determining whether an adverse effect would be material for
the purposes hereof, in the case of each of Buyer (together with its
Subsidiaries) or the Acquired 

 



-36- 

    

 Companies, the adverse effect shall be measured against a company of the
size and scale of the Acquired Companies (taken as a whole). Buyer and its
Affiliates shall be obligated to promptly contest, administratively or in
court, any ruling, order or other action of any Governmental Entity or any
other Person respecting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
Buyer shall have the right to direct all matters (including the timing
thereof) with any Governmental Entity consistent with its obligations under
this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_; _provided_ , that each of the parties hereto agrees
to instruct their respective counsel to cooperate with the other and use
their respective efforts to facilitate and expedite the identification and
resolution of any issues arising under the HSR Act and any Other Antitrust
Laws at the earliest practicable dates. Such efforts and cooperation include
counsels undertaking (i) to promptly inform the other partys counsel of any
oral communication with, and provide copies of written communications with,
any Governmental Entity regarding any such filings or applications or any
such transaction, and (ii) to confer with each other regarding appropriate
contacts with and response to personnel of such Governmental Entity. No party
hereto shall independently participate in any substantive meeting
or discussion with any Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings,
applications, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party
hereto prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by the
relevant Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and participate
(which, at the request of any of the parties hereto, shall be limited to
outside antitrust counsel only).

 

(d) Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
not to, acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by
purchasing a substantial portion of the assets or equity interests of, or by
any other manner, any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree
to acquire any assets, if the entering into of a definitive agreement
relating to or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation
would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining
of, or significantly increase the risk of not obtaining, any clearance
required under the HSR Act and any Other Antitrust Laws for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) significantly increase the
risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii)
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

7.3 _Efforts to Close_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including
the proviso in  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_), each of Buyer and Seller shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly cause the conditions to
Closing to be satisfied and for the Closing to occur. The "reasonable best
efforts" of Seller shall not require Seller or any of its Affiliates to
provide financing to Buyer for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

7.4 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Agreed Tax Treatment_. Buyer shall be a "C corporation" for purposes
of the Code. Buyer shall cause the Company and each other Acquired Company
eligible to do so to (i) join Buyers "consolidated group" (within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-1(h)) effective as of the beginning of
the date following the Closing Date and (ii) to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, treat the Closing Date as the last date of a Tax period of
such Acquired

 



-37- 

    

 Companies (the "Agreed Tax Treatment"). Each party hereto shall file all Tax
Returns consistently with the Agreed Tax Treatment and shall not take any
position inconsistent therewith. Buyer and Seller agree that any Tax
deduction for any of the Transaction Expenses or amounts that would have been
Transaction Expenses but for the fact that they were paid prior to the
Closing, the payment of Indebtedness, or any amounts included as Current
Liabilities (each as finally determined pursuant to this Agreement) shall be
allocated to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Seller and its Affiliates (such
Tax Deduction not to exceed, in the case of PHI, PHIs taxable income for the
Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on the Closing Date). Neither Buyer nor any of
its Affiliates shall have any right to any Tax Refunds received by Seller or
any of its Affiliates with respect to the Acquired Companies for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period.

 

(b) Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing for the avoidance of doubt, the Acquired Companies) to, (i)
file, re-file, supplement, or amend any Tax Return of any Acquired Company for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) voluntarily approach any taxing authority
regarding any Taxes or Tax Returns of any Acquired Company that were
originally due on or before the Closing Date, (iii) make an election under
Section 338 of the Code (or any comparable applicable provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law) with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (iv) make any Tax election with respect to the Acquired
Companies effective on or before the Closing Date, (v) take any action
relating to Taxes or that could create a Tax liability on the Closing Date
(other than as expressly contemplated by this Agreement) that is outside the
ordinary course of business, or (vi) carryback any net operating losses to a
Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date.

(c) Buyer shall pay all Transfer Taxes arising out of or in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall file all
necessary documentation and Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

 

(d) _Allocation of Purchase Price_. No later than 60 days following the
determination of Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_, Seller shall prepare and provide to Buyer an allocation
of the Purchase Price (along with other items of consideration for United
States federal Income Tax purposes) among the PHI Shares and the assets of BF
LLC in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code (as finally determined, and
subject to any further amendment, in each case pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.4(d)_, the "Allocation"). The Allocation shall be final and binding on
Buyer. In case of any adjustment to the Purchase Price (or any other item of
consideration for United States federal Income Tax purposes), requiring an
amendment to the Allocation, Seller shall amend the Allocation and provide
such amended allocation to Buyer (which shall become the Allocation). The
parties hereto agree not to take any position, in connection with any Tax
Return, audit or similar proceeding related to Taxes, that is inconsistent
with the Allocation.

7.5 _Confidentiality_. Seller will not, and will cause its Affiliates not
to, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of Buyer,
disclose or use any confidential or proprietary information of the Acquired
Companies ("Confidential Information"); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
"Confidential Information" will not include any information that (a) is
generally available to, or known by, the public (other than as a result of
disclosure in violation hereof), (b) is independently developed by Seller or
its Affiliates after the Closing without use or reference to

 



-38- 

    

 Confidential Information, or (c) is later lawfully obtained by Seller or its
Affiliates without any duty of confidentiality. If Seller or any of its
Affiliates is compelled to disclose any Confidential Information by judicial
or administrative process or by other requirements of Law, Seller shall
promptly notify Buyer in writing, to the extent legally permissible, of its
intention to make such disclosure and provide a list of the Confidential
Information that Seller or its Affiliates intend to disclose prior to making
such disclosure. Prior to the disclosure of any such Confidential Information,
Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer so that Buyer may seek, at its sole
cost and expense, an appropriate protective order or other remedy. In the
event that such a protective order or other remedy is not obtained prior to
such time as disclosure or production is required, Seller (a) may disclose or
produce only that portion of such Confidential Information to any
Governmental Entity as its legal counsel reasonably believes is required by
applicable Law to be disclosed or produced and (b) will use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain, at Buyers sole cost and expense, an order or other
reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such
Confidential Information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, Seller and its Affiliates shall be permitted to (i) use
Confidential Information required in connection with their Tax or accounting
purposes and to enforce their respective rights under this Agreement or the
Ancillary Documents and (ii) disclose Confidential Information to their
respective and prospective investors, _provided_ that such Confidential
Information is (x) limited solely to pre-Closing financial information of the
Acquired Companies that is of a nature consistent with Sellers and its
Affiliates past communications with their respective investors and
prospective investors and (y) not inconsistent with any information that Buyer
has filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission or has
otherwise publicly disclosed.

7.6 _Financing and Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
advisable or proper to obtain the Financing as promptly as practicable and in
a timely fashion (and in any event, on or prior to the Closing Date) (to the
extent such Financing is required to pay the aggregate Purchase Price, the
amounts required to be paid under _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)_ hereof when due and
payable hereunder), and any other amounts required under the Debt Commitment
Letter to be paid in connection with the initial funding of the debt
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, including using
reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect and enforce in all material
respects the Debt Commitment Letter (including the applicable commitments
thereunder) and any Definitive Debt Financing Agreements (until the
termination thereof in accordance with their respective terms) and comply in
all material respects with its obligations thereunder; (ii) negotiate and
enter into definitive debt financing agreements on the terms contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter (the "Definitive Debt Financing Agreements"); and
(iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to the funding of the Financing
(including the Financing Conditions) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
and the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements. Buyer shall keep Seller
reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and
shall give Seller reasonably prompt notice upon obtaining knowledge of any
fact, change, event or circumstance that is reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the
availability of the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter.

 



-39- 

    

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.6(c)_, prior to the Closing, Buyer shall
not agree to or permit any termination (other than in accordance with its
terms), amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of, or waive
any of its material rights under, the Debt Commitment Letter without Sellers
prior written consent if such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification
or waiver would reasonably be expected (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the
debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter; (B) impose new or
additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions to the receipt of the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, in each case, in a manner that would reasonably be expected
to materially delay or prevent the Closing; or (C) adversely impact the
ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter; _provided_ , that the Debt Commitment Letter may be
amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that had not
executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement and in
connection therewith, amend the economics and other arrangements with respect
to the appointment of such existing and additional lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities. Upon any such amendment,
replacement, supplement or modification, the terms "Debt Commitment Letter"
and "Definitive Debt Financing Agreement" shall mean the Debt Commitment
Letter or applicable Definitive Debt Financing Agreement, as applicable, as so
amended, replaced, supplemented or modified. Buyer shall promptly deliver to
Seller copies of any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other
modification of the Debt Commitment Letter.

 

(c) Buyer (including through its Subsidiaries) shall have the right to
substitute the proceeds of consummated debt or equity financings or asset
sales for all or any portion of the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter by reducing commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter;
_provided_ that the conditions to the use of such proceeds are not less
favorable, taken as a whole, to Buyer than the Financing Conditions as in
effect on the date hereof.

 

(d) If all or any portion of the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter becomes unavailable, or the Debt Commitment Letter shall be
withdrawn, repudiated, terminated or rescinded for any reason, then Buyer
shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain and to negotiate
and enter into definitive agreements with respect to, as promptly as
practicable, but, in no event, later than the date Buyer is required to
consummate the transactions hereunder, from the same and/or alternative
financing sources, alternative financing on terms not materially less
favorable and conditions not less favorable, taken as a whole, to Buyer than
the terms or conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter in an amount
sufficient, when added together with the available cash of Buyer and the
Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date, to enable Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, pay the aggregate Purchase Price
and the amounts required to be paid under _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)_ hereof when
due and payable hereunder, and any other amounts required under the Debt
Commitment Letter to be paid in connection with the initial funding of the
debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter. In the event any
alternative financing is obtained in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _
7.6(d)_ ("Alternative Financing"), references in this Agreement to the
Financing shall also be deemed to refer to such Alternative Financing, and if
one or more commitment letters or definitive financing agreements are entered
into or proposed to be entered into in connection with such Alternative
Financing, references in this Agreement to the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements shall also be deemed to refer to such
commitment letters and definitive

 



-40- 

    

 financing agreements relating to such Alternative Financing, and all
obligations of Buyer pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ shall be applicable
thereto to the same extent as Buyers obligations with respect to the debt
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter.

(e) From the date hereof to the earlier of the Closing Date and the date
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.5_, Seller
shall use its reasonable best efforts, shall cause the Acquired Companies to
use their respective reasonable best efforts, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to use their
reasonable best efforts, at the sole cost and expense of the Buyer, to provide
such reasonable and customary cooperation and information as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the arrangement, syndication
and consummation of the Financing and satisfying the conditions to, and
complying with any obligations of Buyer in connection with the preparation
and completion of, the Financing.

(f) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing  _Section_ __ _
7.6(e)_, such assistance shall include:

(i) furnishing to Buyer and the Financing Providers, to the extent
reasonably requested by Buyer, due diligence materials and any other financial
and other pertinent information relating to the Acquired Companies and their
businesses (but only in the form that such information exists at such time)
to be used in the preparation of registration statements, prospectuses,
offering and information documents (collectively, "Offering Documentation"),
syndication documents and materials, lender and investor presentations and
rating agency presentations regarding the business, operations, financial
projections and prospects of Buyer and its Subsidiaries customary for the
Financing and, to the extent available (but only in the form that such
information exists at such time), information of the type reasonably
determined by Buyer to be required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under
the Securities Act for registered offerings of debt or equity securities in
connection with the Financing;

(ii) assisting Buyer and the Financing Providers in the timely preparation
of Offering Documentation, syndication documents and materials, lender and
investor presentations and rating agency presentations to be used in

under the Securities Act or in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act
or in private placements);

 

(iii) providing to Buyer (x) unaudited combined balance sheets of the
Acquired Companies and related statements of income and cash flows as of the
end of and for each fiscal quarter ending after the date hereof and at least
30 days before the Closing Date (other than the fourth fiscal quarter of any
fiscal year), and (y) unaudited combined balance sheets of the Acquired
Companies and related statements of income and cash flows as of the end of and
for each fiscal year ending after the date hereof and at least 45 days before
the Closing Date, in each case prepared in accordance with GAAP (except (i)
as may be stated in the notes thereto, (ii) that any such quarterly financial
statements may be subject to year-end adjustments, (iii) that such statements
may lack the footnote disclosure otherwise required by GAAP and (iv) as set
forth on Schedule 3.7(b)), as well as, using reasonable best efforts to
provide, other information as is

 



-41- 

    

 necessary to receive from the independent auditors of the Acquired
Companies financial information customary "comfort" (including "negative
assurance comfort") with respect to the financial information to be included
in any Offering Documentation (whether in a registered offering under the
Securities Act or in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act or in
private placements), and using reasonable best efforts to assist in obtaining
any such letters and any consents with respect to the combined financial
statements of the Acquired Companies from the independent auditors of the
Acquired Companies financial information;

 

(iv) using reasonable best efforts to cause the independent auditors of the
Acquired Companies financial information to provide assistance and
cooperation to Buyer and the Financing Providers in connection with any
Financing;

 

(v) cooperating with the customary marketing efforts for any portion of the
Financing, including by participating (including by way of using reasonable
best efforts to cause management with appropriate seniority and expertise to
participate), at the request of Buyer, in a reasonable number of diligence
sessions and meetings with the Financing Providers and rating agencies
(including one-on-one meetings or conference calls with potential Financing
Providers), presentations, road shows, drafting sessions, and
other syndication activities, in each case, reasonably necessary for any
Financing;

(vi) facilitating the execution and delivery at the Closing of definitive
and ancillary documents required in connection with or reasonably related to

Date of any obligations of the Acquired Companies in respect of the
Indebtedness under the Existing Debt Agreements, and the release of
any related Liens;

(viii) providing customary authorization letters to the Financing Parties
authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders;

(ix) using reasonable best efforts to assist Buyer in obtaining any
corporate credit and family ratings from any ratings agencies in respect of
the relevant borrower, issuer or parent borrower under the Financing and
public ratings for the Financing;

 

(x) using reasonable best efforts to provide all documentation and other
information about the Acquired Companies as is reasonably requested by Buyer
or any Financing Provider at least ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date
which is in connection with the Financing and relates to, and is reasonably
required by, applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules
and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act; and

(xi) executing and delivering any pledge and security documents, and other
financing documents on behalf of the Acquired Companies, in each case as may
be reasonably requested by Buyer, facilitating the granting and perfection of
security interests in collateral (including releasing any Liens on property
or assets securing existing Indebtedness,

 



-42- 

    

 conditional on the Closing) and taking such corporate actions as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer to permit the consummation of the Financing as
promptly as practicable.

 

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Seller or the Acquired Companies
shall be required to (i) take any action that would subject it to actual or
potential liability or conflict with or violate this Agreement or an Acquired
Companys organizational documents (to the extent such conflict or violation
cannot be resolved by such entity using its reasonable best efforts to do so)
or any applicable Laws or result in the contravention of, or that would
reasonably be expected to result in a violation or breach of, or a default
under, any Existing Debt Agreement or Material Contract to which an Acquired
Company is a party as in effect on the date hereof, (ii) bear any cost, fee or
expense or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any other
payment (other than reasonable out-of-pocket costs) or incur any other

connection with the Financing or any of the foregoing prior to the Closing,
(iii) undertake any action that would unreasonably and materially interfere
with the business or operations of Seller or the Acquired Companies, (iv)

exists at such time, (vi) provide access to or disclose any information to
Buyer or its Representatives to the extent such disclosure would jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protections or similar
protections, or (vii) take any action that would change any fiscal period.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any breach by Seller
or the Acquired Companies of their obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_
shall not, whether alone or together with any other breach of this  _Section_
__ _ 7.6_, constitute a failure to satisfy the condition precedent set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_ unless (i) such breach has not been cured by Seller
or any Acquired Company or their respective Representatives within five (5)
Business Days after Buyers delivery to Seller of a written notice specifying
in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances constituting such breach (it
being understood that Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with the Seller to
facilitate the Sellers cure of any such alleged breach) and (ii) such breach
is a willful and material breach and directly results in the Financing not
being available to Buyer.

 

(i) None of Seller or the Acquired Companies or their respective
Representatives shall be required to execute or enter into or perform any
certificate or agreement with respect to the Financing that is not contingent
upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing and no

employee of any Acquired Company before the Closing Date, and (b) claims
relating to COBRA coverage attributable to "qualifying events" with
respect to such employee and his or her beneficiaries and dependents that
occur before the Closing Date (any such claims described under clauses (a) and

 



-43- 

    

 (b), "Seller Welfare and Health Expenses"). Buyer and its Affiliates shall
be solely responsible for (i) claims for Welfare and Health Benefits and for
workers compensation, in each case that are incurred by or with respect to
any employee of any Acquired Company that continues employment with Buyer or
its Affiliates (including any Acquired Company) on or after the Closing Date,
and (ii) claims relating to COBRA coverage attributable to "qualifying
events" with respect to any such employee and his or her beneficiaries and
dependents that occur on or after the Closing Date. For purposes of the
foregoing, a claim shall be considered incurred when the services are
rendered or the supplies are provided, and not when the condition arose. A
life insurance, disability or workers compensation claim shall be considered
incurred when the death, injury or event giving rise to the claim occurs.

any provision of this Agreement.

 

8.4 _Waiver of Conditions_. All conditions set forth in this _Article
VIII_ will be deemed to have been satisfied or waived from and after the
Closing.

8.5 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the transactions
contemplated herein may be abandoned, prior to the Closing solely:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

(b) by either Seller or Buyer, if (i) an Order enjoining or prohibiting any
of the parties hereto from consummating the transactions contemplated hereby
is in effect and such Order

 



-45- 

    

 has become final and non-appealable and (ii) the terminating party has not
materially breached any provision of this Agreement;

 

(c) by Buyer, if (i) a breach or failure to perform any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Seller set forth in this
Agreement shall have occurred which is not cured within thirty (30) days after
Buyer provides Seller written notice thereof, specifying such breach or
failure in reasonable detail and referencing its rights under this _Section_
__ _ 8.5(c)_ in the event such breach or failure is not cured, and renders
impossible the satisfaction of one or more of the conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and (ii) Buyer has not materially breached any provision
of this Agreement;

(d) by Seller, if (i) a breach or failure to perform any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this
Agreement shall have occurred which is not cured within thirty (30) days after
Seller provides Buyer written notice thereof, specifying such breach
or failure in reasonable detail and referencing its rights under this
_Section_ __ _ 8.5(d)_ in the event such breach or failure is not cured, and
renders impossible the satisfaction of one or more of the conditions set forth
in  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ and (ii) Seller has not materially breached any
provision of this Agreement; or

 

(e) by Buyer or Seller if (i) the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before March 12, 2019, and (ii) the terminating party has not materially
breached any provision of this Agreement.

8.6 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) The valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with  _Section_
__ _ 8.5_ shall terminate all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder
and none of the parties shall have any liability to the other party hereunder,
except that (a) _ Section_ __ _ 7.1_, this  _Section_ __ _ 8.6_ and
_Article IX_ shall survive any such termination, and (b) nothing herein shall
relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of any covenant or
agreement in this Agreement prior to such termination. A failure of Buyer to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement because of a
failure to have sufficient available funds will be deemed to be a willful
breach. In the event of termination of this Agreement, and regardless of the
reason for the termination, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms and any such termination
shall not amend, modify, release, waive or otherwise limit any rights
or obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.

ARTICLE IX

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 

9.1 _No Survival of Representations; Warranties and Pre-
Closing Covenants_ _; No Liability_ _._ None of the (a) representations and
warranties or (b) covenants or agreements which require performance at or
prior to the Closing ("Pre-Closing Covenants"), in each case contained in
this Agreement, any Ancillary Document or in any certificate or schedule
delivered pursuant

 



-46- 

    

 hereto or thereto, shall survive the Closing. In furtherance, not
limitation, of the foregoing, the parties hereto, intending to contractually
shorten any otherwise applicable statute of limitations, hereby agree that:
(a) the representations and warranties herein are intended solely to
facilitate disclosure and to give effect to the Closing conditions set forth
in _Article VIII_ , (b) the Pre-Closing Covenants are intended solely to serve
as Closing conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ and (c) from and after the
Closing, no Person will have any entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether
in contract, tort or otherwise, with respect to this Agreement, any Ancillary
Document or any certificate or schedule delivered pursuant hereto or thereto,
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, it being agreed that all
such remedies, entitlements and recourse are expressly waived and released to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, except for any Suit seeking to
specifically enforce, or to recover any damages with respect to the breach of,
any covenant or agreement solely to the extent such covenant or agreement is
to be performed or complied with after the Closing. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall limit the common law liability of (a) Seller in the event
Seller committed Fraud by making any representation or warranty set forth in
_Article III_ or (b) Buyer in the event Buyer committed Fraud by making any
representation or warranty set forth in _Article IV_.

 

9.2 _Investigation by Buyer_.

 

(a) In connection with the decision to execute this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer has inspected and
conducted such reasonable independent review, investigation and analysis
(financial and otherwise) of the Acquired Companies and their respective
businesses as desired by Buyer. The execution of this Agreement
and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by Buyer are not
done in reliance upon any representation or warranty by, or information from,
Seller or the Acquired Companies or any of their respective Affiliates,
Employees or Representatives, whether oral or written, express or implied
(including any implied warranty of merchantability or of fitness for a
particular purpose), except for the representations and warranties
specifically and expressly set forth in _Article III_ (as qualified or
modified by the Seller Disclosure Schedules). Such consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby is instead done entirely on the basis of
Buyers own investigation, analysis, judgment and assessment of the present
and potential value and earning power of the Acquired Companies and their
respective businesses, as well as those representations and warranties by
Seller specifically and expressly set forth in _Article III_ (as qualified or
modified by the Seller Disclosure Schedules).

(b) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties expressly contained _Article III_ , none of Seller, the Acquired
Companies or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, controlling persons, agents, advisors or Representatives, has
made, is making or shall be deemed to have made any representation or
warranty, either express or implied, in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, including as to the accuracy and/or completeness of any
of the information (including, without limitation, any
estimates, projections, forecasts or other forward-looking information)
provided or otherwise made available to Buyer or any of its directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling persons, agents, advisors or
Representatives (including, without limitation, in any management
presentations, information or offering memorandum, supplemental information or
other materials or information with respect to any of the above). With respect
to any such estimate, projection or forecast delivered by or on behalf of any
of the Acquired Companies to Buyer, Buyer acknowledges

 



-47- 

    

 that (i) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections and forecasts, (ii) Buyer is aware that actual results
may differ materially and (iii) Buyer shall not have any claim against Seller
or any of its Nonparty Affiliates with respect to any such estimate,
projection or forecast. Buyer acknowledges that neither Seller nor the
Acquired Companies (nor any Person acting on their behalf) has made any
representations or warranties to Buyer regarding the probable success or
profitability of the Acquired Companies or their respective businesses.

 

9.3 _Notices_. Any notice, request, demand, waiver, consent, approval or
other communication which is required or permitted hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed given: (a) on the date established by the sender
as having been delivered personally, (b) on the date delivered by a private
courier as established by the sender by evidence obtained from the courier,

9.4 _Amendments and Waivers_. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement, or in

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this  _Section_ __ _ 9.4_
and _Sections 9.7_ , _9.8(b)_ , _9.8(c)_ , _9.10_ and _9.19_ (and any other
provision of this Agreement to the extent that an amendment or waiver of such
provision would modify in any material respect the substance of any of the
foregoing provisions) may not be amended or waived in a manner that would be
adverse to a Financing Party without the prior written consent of the relevant
Financing Source. No failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any
right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. 

9.5 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each party
shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection with the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including all legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting and
all other fees and expenses of third parties, whether or not the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated.

9.6 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement may not be assigned by
either party hereto without the prior written consent of the other party
hereto, except that Buyer may assign any and all of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement (x) to one or more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries (
_provided_ , that, any such assignment shall not be undertaken prior to the
Closing if not permitted by the Debt Commitment Letter) or (y) to any of
Buyers Financing Providers as collateral; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no
such assignment shall relieve Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder. Any
purported assignment in violation of this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ shall be null
and void. Subject to the foregoing, all of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

9.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, the Ancillary Documents, any
Schedules hereto and the other documents, instruments and agreements
specifically referred to herein or therein or delivered pursuant hereto or
thereto, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that
may be based upon, arise out of or relate hereto or thereto, or
the negotiation, execution or performance of hereof or thereof (including any
claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or
as 

 



-49- 

    

 an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be governed by the
internal Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of
Law or conflict of Laws rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware
or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the adjudication of any action, suit, proceeding or claim of any kind or
nature, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, against
any Financing Party in connection with this Agreement, the Financing or the
transactions contemplated by the Financing shall be governed by and
in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect
to any choice of Law or conflict of Laws rules or provisions (whether of the
State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

9.8 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a) Any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby shall be brought exclusively
in the Delaware Court of Chancery in New Castle County, or in the event (but
only in the event) that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction
over such action, the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of any such suit, action
or other proceeding. A final judgment in any such suit, action or other
proceeding may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by Law. Each party irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in such courts, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such
action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Each party further agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such partys respective
address set forth herein shall be effective service of process for any such
action, suit or proceeding.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this  _Section_ __ _
9.8_, any action, suit, proceeding or claim of any kind or nature, whether at
law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Party
in connection with this Agreement, the Financing or the transactions
contemplated by the Financing shall be brought exclusively in any New York
state or federal court located in the Borough of Manhattan. Each party hereby
irrevocably submits with regard to any such action, suit, proceeding or claim
for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to
the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not
bring any such action, suit, proceeding or claim relating to this Agreement,
the Financing or the transactions contemplated by the Financing in any court
other than the aforesaid courts.

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING THE FINANCING OR TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY
THE FINANCING) OR THE ACTIONS OF SUCH PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF. EACH PARTY HEREBY
ACKNOWLEDGES AND

 



-50- 

    

 CERTIFIES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS _SECTION_ __ _ 9.8_.

 

9.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, and
any party hereto may execute any such counterpart, each of which when
executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which
counterparts taken together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto. The parties
hereto agree that the delivery of this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and
any other agreements and documents executed and delivered concurrently with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or executed and delivered at the
Closing, may be effected by means of an exchange of facsimile signatures or
other electronic delivery.

 

9.10 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Other than _Sections 5.3_ , _6.2_
(from and after the Closing),  _6.6_ , _9.17_ and _9.18_ , and with respect
thereto, _Sections 9.6_ through _9.10_ and _Sections 9.13_ through _9.16_ ,
which are intended to benefit and may also be enforced by the Releasees,
Covered Parties, Paul Hastings and the Nonparty Affiliates, as applicable, no
provision of this Agreement is intended to confer upon any Person other than
the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that each party specifically acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of
_Sections 9.4_ , _9.7_ , _9.8(b)_ and _9.8(c)_ , this _Section_ __ _ 9.10_
and _Section_ __ _ 9.19_ are intended to benefit and may be enforced by any
Financing Party (to the extent contemplated thereby).

9.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and any
Schedules hereto and the other documents, instruments and agreements
specifically referred to herein or therein or delivered pursuant hereto or
thereto set forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto and
thereto with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All
Schedules, including any Seller Disclosure Schedule, referred to herein are
intended to be and hereby are specifically made a part of this Agreement and
incorporated by reference herein. Any and all previous agreements and
understandings between or among the parties regarding the subject matter of
this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and any Schedules hereto, whether
written or oral, are superseded by this Agreement, except for the
Confidentiality Agreement which shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

 

9.12 _Seller Disclosure Schedules_. Except as otherwise provided in the
Seller Disclosure Schedules, all capitalized terms used therein shall have
the meanings assigned to them in this Agreement. Matters reflected in the
Seller Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by
this Agreement to be disclosed. No disclosure made in the Seller Disclosure
Schedules shall constitute an admission or determination that any fact or
matter so disclosed is material, has had or could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, meets a dollar or other threshold set
forth in this Agreement or would otherwise be required to be disclosed, and

 



-51- 

    

 no Person shall use the fact of the setting of a threshold or the inclusion
of such facts or matters in any dispute or controversy as to whether any
obligation, amount, fact or matter is or is not material, is or is not in
excess of a dollar or other threshold or would otherwise be required to be
disclosed, for purposes of this Agreement. Information disclosed in any Seller
Disclosure Schedule will qualify any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement in this Agreement to the extent that the relevance or applicability
of the information disclosed to any such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement is reasonably apparent on its face, notwithstanding the absence of
a reference or cross-reference to such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on any such Seller Disclosure Schedule or the absence of a reference
or cross-reference to such Seller Disclosure Schedule in such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement. No disclosure in the Seller Disclosure
Schedules relating to any possible breach or violation of any agreement or Law
shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or
violation exists or has actually occurred.

9.13 _Captions_. All captions contained in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only, do not form a part of this Agreement and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

9.14 _Remedies_.

 

(a) The parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of
either party hereto to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder will
cause irreparable injury to the other party hereto, for which damages, even if
available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, the parties hereto
hereby acknowledge and agree that in the event of any breach or threatened
breach by any party hereto of any of its covenants or obligations set forth in
this Agreement, in addition to any other available remedies (including
damages) the non-breaching party may have at law or in equity, the non-
breaching party hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent or restrain such breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by
such party hereto, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of
this Agreement to prevent such breaches or threatened breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the covenants, agreements and obligations of such
other party hereto under this Agreement (including the obligation to
consummate the Closing). Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees not to raise
any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the covenants, agreements and obligations of such
parties under this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives (i) any
defenses in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be
adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other
security as a prerequisite to seeking or obtaining equitable relief.

 

(b) In determining damages for any failure by Buyer to close if its
conditions to Closing are satisfied or for any failure to comply with its
covenants in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ or _7.3_ that result in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not being consummated, Buyer agrees that
Sellers damages shall include damages based upon any decrease in value of
the Securities, lost premium or lost benefit of the bargain to Seller (in each
case taking into account all relevant matters, including the total amount
payable to Seller under this Agreement and the time value of money);
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Sellers damages calculated
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.14(b)_ be determined to exceed the Purchase
Price.

 



-52- 

    

9.15 _Severability_. Any provision of this Agreement which is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be ineffective to the extent of such
invalidity or unenforceability without invalidating or rendering unenforceable
the remaining provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability
in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

 

9.16 _Interpretation_. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement, and any rule of construction or
interpretation otherwise requiring this Agreement to be construed or
interpreted against any party by virtue of the authorship of this Agreement
shall not apply to the construction and interpretation hereof. For the
purposes of this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided herein or
unless the context otherwise requires: (a) the meaning assigned to each term
defined herein shall be equally applicable to both the singular and
the plural forms of such term and vice versa, and words denoting either
gender shall include both genders as the context requires; (b) where a word or
phrase is defined herein, each of its other grammatical forms shall have a
corresponding meaning; (c) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereunder,"
"hereby" and "herewith" and words of similar import shall, unless otherwise
stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement; (d) when a reference is made in this
Agreement to an Article, Section, paragraph, Exhibit or Schedule, such
reference is to an Article, Section, paragraph, Exhibit or Schedule to this
Agreement unless otherwise specified; (e) the word "include," "includes," and
"including" when used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "but not limited to," unless otherwise specified; and (f) all
accounting terms used and not defined herein have the respective meanings
given to them under GAAP.

 

9.17 _Privilege; Conflicts of Interest_.

 

(a) Buyer: (i) acknowledges that Paul Hastings LLP ("Paul Hastings") has
represented the Acquired Companies and Seller in connection with the
transactions provided for herein and that, effective upon the Closing, the
Acquired Companies shall, without the necessity of further documentation of
transfer, be deemed to have irrevocably assigned and transferred to Seller
immediately prior to the Closing all of the Acquired Companies right to,
title to and interest in all communications with, and work product of, Paul
Hastings as they relate to this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents,
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and the preparation and
negotiation hereof and thereof, together with all written or other materials
consisting of, containing, summarizing or embodying such communications and
work product, and (ii) agree that the intent and effect of this provision is
to grant Seller control over the exercise of the attorney-client privilege
held by any Acquired Company in respect of this Agreement, the Ancillary
Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and the
preparation and negotiation hereof and thereof, together with all written or
other materials consisting of, containing, summarizing or embodying such
communications and work product, and (iii) agree that after the Closing, the
Acquired Companies will not (and Buyer will cause the Acquired Companies not
to) knowingly waive the attorney-client privilege belonging to any Acquired
Company, if any, relating to any matter relating to this Agreement,
the Ancillary Documents and the transactions contemplated hereunder and
thereunder, and the preparation and negotiation hereof and thereof occurring
before the Closing or disclose the content of communications or work product
related to such privilege to

 



-53- 

    

 any Person with the intention of or knowingly waiving the attorney-client
privilege to which the communications or work product is subject, without the
express written consent of Seller.

 

(b) Buyer and Seller further intend that Seller shall have the right,
should it so choose, to have the benefit of representation by Paul Hastings
in connection with post-Closing matters concerning this Agreement, any
Ancillary Document and the transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder.
Accordingly, each of Buyer and Seller agree that this Agreement will (i)
constitute consultation with respect to the potential conflict of interest
that Paul Hastings may have as a result of its representation of the Acquired
Companies both historically and in connection with this Agreement, the
Ancillary Documents and the transactions contemplated hereunder and
thereunder, (ii) confirm that each party understands the risks associated with
potential conflicts of interest and that the parties have alternatives to
waiving the potential conflict (including refusing to waive the potential
conflict or declining to engage in the matter giving rise to the potential
conflict), and (iii) that the parties still wish to consent to Paul Hastingss
representation, if requested, of Seller in connection with matters relating
to this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and/or the transactions
contemplated hereunder and/or thereunder, and waive any conflicts of interest
which do or may exist as a result of such representations, including
in connection with any litigation or adversarial proceeding arising among the
parties, or any of them, regarding this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and
the transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder.

 

9.18 _No Recourse Against Nonparty Affiliates_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, except in the case of Fraud in the making
of any of the representations or warranties set forth in _Article III_ or
_Article IV_ , (a) all claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes of action
(whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute)
available to Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any of its or their
Representatives or any other Person through or on behalf of Buyer that may be
based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be
connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement), may be made only against (and are those solely of)
Seller; (b) no Person other than Seller, including any Affiliate or any
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager,
stockholder, agent, attorney, or representative of, or any financial
advisor or lender to, Seller or any of its Affiliates, or any director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney, or representative of, or any financial advisor or
lender to, any of the foregoing ("Nonparty Affiliates"), shall have any
liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by
statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations, or liabilities arising
under, out of, in connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby or based on, in respect of, or by
reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or breach
or the transactions contemplated hereby; (c) to the maximum extent permitted
by law, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Acquired Companies), hereby waives and releases all such
liabilities, claims, causes of action, and obligations against any
such Nonparty Affiliates; and (d) without limiting the foregoing, to the
maximum extent permitted by law, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates

otherwise be available at law or in equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or

 by statute or based on theories of equity, agency, control, instrumentality,
alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise, piercing the veil,
unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise, and (ii) disclaims any
reliance upon any Nonparty Affiliates with respect to the performance of this
Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as
an inducement to enter into, this Agreement.

that may be expressed or implied in this Agreement or any document,
agreement, or instrument delivered contemporaneously herewith, in no event
shall any Financing Party have any liability or obligation to, or be subject
to any action, suit, proceeding or claim from, Seller, the Acquired Companies
or any Nonparty Affiliate in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any Financing, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and none of the Seller, the
Acquired Companies and the Nonparty Affiliates will have any rights or claims
against any Financing Party (solely in its capacity as a Financing Party)
