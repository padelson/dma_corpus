ARTICLE 2 
PURCHASE PRICE

 



 

2.1 _Purchase Price_. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the purchase price for the Assets shall be Seven Hundred Million
Dollars ($700,000,000) (" ** _Purchase Price_** "). The Purchase Price shall
be payable as follows:

 



 

(a) Within one (1) Business Day after the Execution Date, Buyer shall pay
Thirty-Five Million Dollars ($35,000,000) as a performance deposit (" **
_Performance Deposit_** ") to Wells Fargo, N.A. (the " ** _Escrow Agent_** ")
by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Concurrently with the funding
of the Performance Deposit, the Parties shall enter into an escrow agreement
with the Escrow Agent, substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit H_ (the
" ** _Escrow Agreement_** ").

 



 

(b) If Closing occurs, then Seller and Buyer shall deliver at Closing a joint
instruction to the Escrow Agent to release the Performance Deposit, together
with any interest accrued thereon, to Seller, and Buyer shall pay the
difference between the Closing Amount and the Performance Deposit to Seller by
wire transfer of immediately available funds. If this Agreement is terminated
without a Closing, then the Performance Deposit and any interest accrued
thereon shall be distributed in accordance with _Section 12.2_.

 



 

(c) After Closing, final adjustments to the Purchase Price shall be made
pursuant to the Final Settlement Statement to be delivered pursuant to
_Section 14.1(a)_ and payments made by Buyer or Seller as provided in
_Section 14.1(a)_, and upon final resolution of any Disputed Title Matters
and Disputed Environmental Matters in accordance with _Article 6_.

 



 

2.2 _Allocation of the Purchase Price_. Solely for the purposes of _Article
4_ and _Section 5.4(a)_, Buyer and Seller have agreed to the allocation of
the unadjusted Purchase Price among each of the Hydrocarbon Wells and the
Leases (and solely with respect to the Leases, only insofar as such Leases
cover the Net Mancos Acres) (" ** _Allocated Values_** "), and such allocation
of value is set forth in _Schedule 2.2_. For the avoidance of doubt, no value
shall be allocated to the Specified Overriding Royalty Interests under this
_Section 2.2_.

 



 

2.3 _Adjustments to Purchase Price and Preliminary Settlement_. The Purchase
Price shall be adjusted according to this _Section 2.3_ without duplication.
Such adjustment shall be set out in a preliminary settlement statement (" **
_Preliminary Settlement Statement_** ") that shall be delivered by Seller to
Buyer at least five (5) days prior to Closing, and in a Final Settlement
Statement in accordance with _Section 14.1_. The Preliminary Settlement
Statement shall set forth the Purchase Price as adjusted as provided in this
_Section 2.3_ using the best information available at the Closing Date.
Within three (3) days after its receipt of the Preliminary Settlement
Statement, Buyer may deliver to Seller a written report containing all changes
with the explanation therefor that Buyer proposes to be made to the
Preliminary Settlement Statement, if any, and Seller shall consider all such
proposed changes in good faith. The Preliminary Settlement Statement, as
agreed upon by the Parties, will be used to adjust the Purchase Price at
Closing; provided that if the Parties cannot agree on the Preliminary
Settlement Statement prior to the Closing, the Preliminary Settlement
Statement as proposed by Seller will be used to adjust the Purchase Price at
Closing, which amount shall be paid at Closing and is referred to herein as
the " ** _Closing Amount_**."

 



 

(a) _Property Expenses_. The term " ** _Property Expenses_** " means all
capital expenses (including all capital expenditures authorized by _Section
9.1(a)_, but excluding, in all cases, any Asset Taxes or Property Taxes) and
operating expenses incurred in the ownership, development and operation of the
Assets in the ordinary course of business, including for the period between
the Effective Time and the Closing Date (x) with respect to Assets operated by
Seller, internal overhead

 



      
 

 



 

of $300,000 per month plus all overhead actually collected from Third Party
interest owners under the applicable operating agreements, and (y) with
respect to Assets operated by Third Parties, the amount payable under the
applicable joint operating agreement, and, in each case where applicable, that
are incurred in accordance with any relevant operating agreement or other
Contract, if any, and all Burdens incurred in connection with the Leases or
the production and sale of Hydrocarbons therefrom.

 



 

(b) _Proration of Costs and Revenues_.

 



 

(i) Buyer shall be entitled to all production of Hydrocarbons from or
attributable to the Leases, Lands, and Wells attributable to the period at and
after the Effective Time (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto),

price, the average price per unit for sales of production for the respective
production period attributable to the Assets as of the Effective Time, less

shall be made (i) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and, to the
extent consistent with this Agreement, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States, as consistently applied in the oil
and gas industry, (ii) without duplication (in this Agreement or otherwise),

Expenses which are the obligation of any other Party under the terms of this
Agreement, then such other Party shall promptly, but in any event within

Party, reimburse the Party which paid such Property Expenses, and (iii) if a
Party receives an invoice of Property Expenses which is owed by another Party,
such Party receiving the invoice shall promptly forward such invoice to the
Party obligated to pay the same. Except as set forth in _Section 9.3(c)_, the
Parties shall have no further obligations under this _Section 2.3(h)_ from

classes of assets into which the Assets properly belong consistent with
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder
(and any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law, as appropriate),
within ninety (90) days after the delivery of the Final Settlement Statement.
If the Parties reach an agreement with respect to such allocation (as agreed,
the " ** _Tax Allocation_** "), (i) the Parties shall update the Tax
Allocation in a manner consistent with the original Tax Allocation and Section
1060 of the Code following any adjustment to the Purchase Price or any other
items properly treated as consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes
pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) the Parties shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, report consistently with the Tax Allocation on all Tax returns,

Tax Allocation unless otherwise required by applicable Law; _provided,
however_ , that no Party shall be unreasonably impeded in its ability and
discretion to negotiate, compromise and/or settle any tax audit, claim or
similar proceedings in connection with such Tax Allocation or to comply with
any resolution of any such audit, claim or proceeding in connection with the
Tax Allocation. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this _Section
2.4_, the Parties agree that it will not be inconsistent with the Tax
Allocation for (a) Buyers cost to differ from the total amount allocated in
the Tax Allocation to reflect capitalized acquisition costs not included in
the total amount allocated pursuant to this _Section 2.4_, (b) the amount
realized by Seller to differ from the total amount allocated pursuant to this
_Section 2.4_ to reflect transaction costs that reduce the amount realized
for U.S. federal income Tax purposes and (c) Buyers and Sellers cost and
amount realized, respectively, to differ to take into account differences as
to any other payments to Seller treated as purchase price for the Assets for
income Tax purposes, and any adjustments to the foregoing hereunder.

3.1 _Due Diligence_. Upon execution of this Agreement, Seller will make the
Records available to Buyer and its representatives for inspection and review
to permit Buyer to perform its due diligence (" ** _Due Diligence Review_** ")
at the offices of Seller during Sellers normal business hours or as otherwise
reasonably requested by Buyer to complete its Due Diligence Review. Buyer
shall be entitled to conduct its Due Diligence Review until the Defect Notice
Date (" ** _Due Diligence Period_** "). All notices pertaining to the Due
Diligence Review and to be delivered pursuant to _Article 4_ or _Article 5_
must be received by Seller no later than 5:00 p.m., Central Time, on the 45th
day after the Execution Date (" ** _Defect Notice Date_** ").

representatives reasonable access to Assets operated by Seller during Sellers
normal business hours, for the purpose of conducting an on-site inspection of
the Assets, but only to the extent Seller has authority to grant such access
without breaching any restriction binding on Seller (provided that Seller will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek a waiver of any such
restrictions). All investigations and due diligence conducted by Buyer or any
Buyers representative shall be conducted at Buyers sole cost, risk and
expense and any conclusions made from any examination done by Buyer or any
Buyers representative shall result from Buyers own independent review and
judgment. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts (but without
incurring any out-of-pocket costs or expenses, liability or obligations to
Seller) to obtain permission for Buyer to gain access to Third Party operated
Assets to inspect the condition of the same. Seller or its designee shall have
the right to accompany Buyer and Buyers representatives whenever they are on
site on the Assets. Buyers investigation and review shall be conducted in a
manner that minimizes interference with the ownership or operation of the

 



      
 

 



 

Assets or the business of Seller or co-owners thereof. Buyers inspection
right with respect to the environmental condition of the Assets shall be
limited to conducting a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in accordance

Practice Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment
Process (Publication Designation: E1527-13) (" ** _Phase I_** "). Buyer shall
not be entitled to conduct any Phase II environmental assessments, any
invasive or intrusive testing, or sampling on or relating to the Assets
without the prior written consent of Seller, such consent to be granted,
conditioned or withheld at the sole discretion of Seller. Notwithstanding the
above, if following Buyers Phase I environmental assessment, in the
professional judgment of Buyers environmental consultant, a Phase II
environmental assessment is necessary to properly and accurately characterize
an Environmental Defect or associated Environmental Defect Amount, Buyer may
request Sellers consent to such Phase II environmental assessment by
furnishing Seller with a written description of the need for and proposed
scope of the Phase II environmental assessment to be conducted, including a
description of the activities proposed to be conducted and a description of
the approximate location and expected timing of such activities. Should Seller
withhold its consent to any such Phase II environmental assessment, Buyer
shall have the right, at its sole election, to exclude the Assets directly
affected by the alleged Environmental Defect from the Transaction and such
excluded Assets shall thereafter become Retained Assets for all purposes
hereunder. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the occurrence of Closing,
Buyer shall furnish to Seller, free of costs, a copy of any written final
reports and test results prepared for Buyer by Buyers environmental
consultants related to any such Phase I, and if permitted, Phase II or further
environmental assessment, intrusive testing or sampling on or relating to any
of the Assets as soon as reasonably possible after such report is prepared.
Seller shall have the right, at its option, to split with Buyer any samples
collected pursuant to approved invasive activities. If this Agreement
terminates prior to the occurrence of Closing, Buyer (i) shall promptly return
to Seller or certify to Seller that Buyer has destroyed all copies of the
Records in the possession or control of Buyer or any of Buyers
representatives, and (ii) shall keep and shall cause each Buyer representative
to keep, any and all information obtained by or on behalf of Buyer
confidential in accordance with terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

3.3 _Indemnification_. Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Seller Indemnified Parties and the other owners of interests in the Assets
from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, liabilities,
losses, costs and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys
fees) attributable to personal injury, death or damage to property arising out
of or relating to access to the Records, any offices of Seller, or the Assets
prior to the Closing by Buyer or any Buyers representatives, including
personal injury, death or damage to property, EVEN IF SUCH CLAIMS, DAMAGES,
LIABILITIES, LOSSES, COSTS AND EXPENSES ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE
NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER
LEGAL FAULT OF ANY MEMBER OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES (BUT EXCLUDING
GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT ON THE PART OF SELLER OR ANY OF THE
SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES).

 



 

3.4 _Disclaimer_. Except for the representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement, Seller makes no warranty or representation of any kind as to
the Records or any information contained therein. Buyer agrees that any
conclusions drawn from the Records shall be the result of its own independent
review and judgment.

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount shall be
the Title Defect Amount;

 



 

(ii) if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance which is undisputed and liquidated
in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount of the payment
necessary to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;

 



 

(iii) provided that such amount shall not be greater than the Allocated Value
of the Title Defect Property, if the Title Defect solely represents a decrease
in the actual Net Revenue Interest for any Hydrocarbon Well below the Net
Revenue Interest stated for a Hydrocarbon Well in _Exhibit B-1_, along with a
proportional decrease to the Working Interest for such Hydrocarbon Well, then
the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such
Well multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
stated for a Hydrocarbon Well in _Exhibit B-1_; _provided_ that if the Title
Defect is not effective or does not affect an individual Hydrocarbon Well
throughout the productive life of such Hydrocarbon Well, the Title Defect
Amount determined hereunder shall be reduced to take into account the
applicable time period only;

 



 

(iv) provided that such amount shall not be greater than the Allocated Value
of the Title Defect Property, if the Title Defect solely represents a decrease
in the actual Net Revenue Interest for any Lease Tract below the Net Revenue
Interest stated for a Lease Tract in _Exhibit A-1_, along with a proportional
decrease to the Working Interest for such Lease Tract, then the Title Defect
Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Lease Tract
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated for a
Lease Tract in _Exhibit A-1_; _provided_ that if the Title Defect is not
effective or does not affect an individual Lease, insofar as it covers a Lease
Tract, throughout the productive life of such Lease, insofar as it covers a
Lease Tract, the Title Defect Amount determined hereunder shall be reduced to
take into account the applicable time period only;

 



      
 

 



 

(v) if the Title Defect represents a decrease in the Net Mancos Acres for any
Lease Tract below the Net Mancos Acres stated in _Exhibit A-1_ for such Lease
Tract, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated
Value of such Lease Tract _multiplied by_ a fraction, the numerator of which
is the decrease in the Net Mancos Acres for said Lease Tract and the
denominator of which is the Net Mancos Acres for said Lease Tract stated in
_Exhibit A-1_; and

 



 

(vi) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, Encumbrance, burden or
other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described in
_subsections (i))_ through _(v)_ above, the Title Defect Amount shall be
determined by taking into account the following factors: (A) the Allocated
Value of the Title Defect Property; (B) the portion of the Title Defect
Property affected by the Title Defect; (C) the legal effect of the Title
Defect; (D) the potential economic effect of a Title Defect over the
productive life of the affected Hydrocarbon Well or the life of the applicable
Lease Tract with regard to Net Mancos Acres; (E) the values placed upon the
Title Defect by Buyer and Seller and (F) such other reasonable factors as are
necessary to make a proper evaluation.

 



 

(aa) " ** _Title Defect Deductible_** " means an amount equal to two percent
(2%) of the unadjusted Purchase Price.

 



 

(bb) " ** _Title Defect Property_** _"_ means the individual Hydrocarbon Well
or the individual Lease Tract affected by the Title Defect.

 



 

(cc) " ** _Working Interest_** " means, with respect to a Hydrocarbon Well,
the percentage of the costs and expenses for the maintenance, development,
operation and the production relating to such Hydrocarbon Well for the
productive life of such Hydrocarbon Well (provided that the underlying Leases
remain in full force and effect and included in the Unit for such Hydrocarbon
Well), and with respect to a Lease Tract, the life of the Lease Tract, in each
case, without regard to the effect of any Burdens.

 



 

4.2 _Seller s Title_.

 



 

(a) _Defensible Title; Limited Special Warranty of Title_. Except for the
limited special warranties of title (" ** _Special Warranty of Title_** ") as
set forth in the Assignment, Conveyance and Bill of Sale delivered at Closing
(which form of assignment is attached as _Exhibit I_ (the " ** _Assignment_**
")) and the Special Warranty of Title in the Special Warranty Deed delivered
at Closing (which form is attached as _Exhibit M_ (the " ** _Special Warranty
Deed_** ")), (i) Seller makes no warranty or representation, express, implied,
statutory or otherwise, with respect to Sellers title to the Assets and (ii)
Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Buyers sole remedies for any defect
of title, including any Title Defect with respect to an individual Hydrocarbon
Well or a Lease Tract, shall be Buyers right to adjust the Purchase Price to
the extent provided in this _Article 4_ (or, if applicable, to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Article 12_).

 



 

(b) _Exclusive Remedy_. _Section 4.4_ and the Special Warranty of Title set
forth in the Assignment and the Special Warranty Deed (including, if
applicable, Buyers right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article
12_) shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to Sellers
failure to have Defensible Title with respect to the Assets. Notwithstanding
anything herein provided to the contrary, if a Title Defect asserted by Buyer
under this _Article 4_ results from any matter which could also result in the
breach of any representation or warranty of Seller under _Article 7_ of this
Agreement, then Buyer shall only be entitled to assert such matter as a Title
Defect to the extent permitted by this _Article 4_ and Buyer shall be
precluded from also

 



      
 

 



 

asserting such matter as the basis of the breach of any such representation or
warranty under _Article 7_.

 



 

4.3 _Title Defects, Title Benefits and Notices_.

Seller for:

 



 

(i) any individual Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount does not
exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold; or

 



 

(ii) any Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount exceeds the Individual
Title Defect Threshold unless the Title Defect Amounts for all such Title
Defects, less any Title Benefit Amounts (excluding any Title Defects timely
cured by Seller), exceed the Title Defect Deductible, after which point Buyer
shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies
provided herein only with respect to such Title Defects in excess of the Title
Defect Deductible.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article 4_, the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any
Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of the Title Defect
Property.

 



 

(b) _Notice of Title Defects_. On or before the Defect Notice Date, Buyer
shall notify Seller of any Title Defects pursuant to a Notice of Title
Defects. Any Notice of Title Defects shall be in writing and shall contain the

Defect; and

 



 

(v) the Title Defect Amount that Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated Value
of such Title Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s) and
the computations and information upon which Buyers belief is based.

 



 

To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Title Defects,
Buyer agrees to give Seller, on or prior to the end of each calendar week
prior to the Defect Notice Date, written notice of all Title Defects
discovered by Buyer during the preceding calendar week that Buyer intends to
assert as Title Defects hereunder, which notice may be sent by electronic
mail, be preliminary in nature, and supplemented on or prior to the Defect
Notice Date; _provided_ that, Buyers failure to deliver any such notice shall
not waive or adversely affect Buyers right to notify Seller of Title Defects
pursuant to a Notice of Title Defects prior to the Defect Notice Date.

 



 

(c) _Notice of Title Benefits_. On or before the Defect Notice Date, Buyer
shall provide Seller (if Buyer has Knowledge of any Title Benefits) and Seller
shall have the right (but not the obligation) to provide Buyer with a Title
Benefit Notice. The Title Benefit Notice shall be in writing and contain the
following with respect to each Title Benefit:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) a description of the Title Benefit;

 



 

(ii) the Title Benefit Property;

 



 

(iii) the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property;

 



 

(iv) supporting documents reasonably evidencing the existence of any such
Title Benefit; and

 



 

(v) the Title Benefit Amount which a Party reasonably believes the Allocated
Value of such Title Benefit Property is increased by the Title Benefit, and

4.4 _Remedies for Title Defects and Title Benefits_.

 



 

(a) _Seller s Right to Cure_. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure or remove at any time before
five (5) days prior to the Closing (" ** _Curative Date_** "), any Title
Defects of which it has been advised by Buyer prior to or on the Defect Notice
Date.

 



 

(b) _Remedies for Title Defects_. If a Title Defect affecting a Title Defect
Property identified in a Notice of Title Defect is not cured on or before the
Curative Date, the Parties shall attempt in good faith to reach agreement
within five (5) days after the Curative Date on the existence of such Title
Defect and the Title Defect Amount. If the Parties reach agreement on the
existence of the Title Defect and the Title Defect Amount, the Purchase Price
shall be adjusted for such Title Defect Amount in accordance with _Section
2.3(d)(iv)_, subject to the Individual Title Defect Threshold and the Title
Defect Deductible. In the event that the Parties do not reach such an
agreement by the end of such five (5) day period, then the Parties shall
submit the existence of such Title Defect and the disputed Title Defect Amount
to binding expert determination pursuant to _Section 6.1_. _Article 6_ shall
apply to such unresolved Title Defects and disputed Title Defect Amounts, and
if as a result of such process it is determined that there is a valid Title
Defect, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Title Defect Amount for the
Title Defect Property, subject to the Individual Title Defect Threshold and
the Title Defect Deductible.

 



 

(c) _Remedies for Title Benefits_. The value of a Title Benefit and the
resulting Title Benefit Amount shall be determined by the Parties in good
faith taking into account all relevant factors. In the event the Parties
cannot agree on the Title Benefit Amount, the disagreement shall be submitted
to binding resolution pursuant to _Section 6.1_. There shall be no increase
to the Purchase Price as a result of a Title Benefit, and the aggregate Title
Benefit Amounts with respect to all Title Benefits shall only be offset
against the aggregate of all Title Defect Amounts.

 



 

4.5 _Consents and Preferential Rights_.

 



 

(a) _Consents_. No sooner than five Business Days but no later than ten
Business Days after the Execution Date, Seller shall give notices and request
consent from all holders of Consents (including all Required Consents). Prior
to Closing, Seller shall use reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents
(including all Required Consents) that are required to be obtained in
connection with the Transaction. If prior to Closing Seller fails to obtain a
Required Consent to assign an Affected Asset, then Seller shall retain the
Affected Asset as a Retained Asset and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by
the Allocated Value of the Affected Asset. Seller, with Buyers assistance,
shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain such Required Consent as promptly
as possible following Closing. If such Required Consent has been obtained as
of the Final Settlement Date, Seller shall convey

 



      
 

 



 

the Affected Asset to Buyer effective as of the Effective Time and Buyer shall
pay Seller the Allocated Value of the Affected Asset, less any proceeds from
the Affected Asset attributable to the period of time after the Effective Time
received and retained by Seller (net of any Property Expenses paid by Seller
attributable to such Affected Asset during such period). If such Required
Consent has not been obtained as of the Final Settlement Date, the Affected
Asset shall be excluded from the Transaction and permanently treated as a
Retained Asset. Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in obtaining any
Required Consent including providing assurances of reasonable financial
conditions, but Buyer shall not be required to expend funds or make any other
type of financial commitments a condition of obtaining such consent.

 



 

(b) _Preferential Rights_. No sooner than five Business Days but no later than
ten Business Days after the Execution Date, Seller shall give notices required
in connection with all (i) preferential purchase rights, rights of first
refusal or other similar rights and (ii) rights of first offer, tag-along
rights, drag-along rights or other similar rights, in each case of clause (i)
and (ii) above, that are applicable to the transfer of the Assets in
connection with the Transaction (collectively, " ** _Preferential Rights_**
"). If any Preferential Right is exercised prior to the Closing Date, then the
Affected Asset shall be excluded from the Assets transferred hereunder as a
Retained Asset and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by an amount
equal to the Allocated Value of such Affected Asset. If by Closing, either (A)
the time frame for the exercise of a Preferential Right has not expired and
Seller has not received notice of an intent not to exercise or a waiver of the
Preferential Rights, or (B) a Third Party exercises its Preferential Right,
but fails to consummate the purchase prior to the Closing, then Seller shall
retain the Affected Asset as a Retained Asset and the Purchase Price shall be
adjusted downward by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Affected
Asset. As to any Affected Assets retained by Seller hereunder, following
Closing and prior to the Final Settlement Date if a Preferential Right is not
consummated within the time frame specified in the Preferential Right, or if
the time frame for exercise of the Preferential Right expires without exercise
after the Closing, Seller shall promptly convey the Affected Asset to Buyer
effective as of the Effective Time, and Buyer shall pay to Seller the
Allocated Value thereof pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Tag-Along Rights_. In connection with consummating the Transaction, Buyer
shall comply with the tag-along and other similar rights of Third Parties
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the instruments described on _Schedule
4.5(c)_, and shall purchase all such interests that such Third Parties choose
to offer for sale to Buyer pursuant to the Tag-Along Agreements in accordance
with the terms of such Tag-Along Agreements.

9.3 _Covenants and Agreements of Buyer_. Buyer covenants and agrees with
Seller as follows:

 



 

(a) _Confidentiality_. All information obtained from Seller in connection with
the Transaction (" ** _Information_** ") is deemed by the Parties to be
confidential. " ** _Information_** " does not include information which (i) is
or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a
disclosure by Buyer or its representatives in breach hereof; (ii) was within
Buyers or its Affiliates or its or its Affiliates representatives
possession, prior to its being furnished to Buyer by Seller pursuant to this
Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_ that the source of such
information was not known by Buyer, to be bound by a contractual, legal or
fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to Seller; (iii) becomes available to
Buyer or its Affiliates or Buyers or its Affiliates representatives on a
non-confidential basis from a source other than the Seller or any of its
representatives, _provided_ that such source is not known by Buyer to be bound
by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the
Seller with respect to such information; or (iv) has been or is subsequently
independently conceived or developed by Buyer or its Affiliates or its or its
Affiliates representatives without use of or reference to the Information.
Until completion of the Closing, except as required by Law or stock exchange
rules, each Party and its directors, officers, agents, advisors and
representatives will hold in strict confidence the terms of this Agreement and
Buyer and its officers, agents and representatives will hold in strict
confidence the Information, and Buyer shall be responsible for any violation
of any obligations under this _Section 9.3(a)_ by any of its directors,
officers, agents, advisors and representatives. The Confidentiality Agreement
dated November 6, 2017, as amended on January 25, 2018 (the " **
_Confidentiality Agreement_** "), between Seller and Buyer shall be deemed to
terminate as of the Execution Date of this Agreement except that if the
Closing does not occur, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
govern and the obligation of this _Section 9.3(a)_ shall expire. If the
Closing should occur, from and after the Closing, for a period of two years
and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Seller shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates and

 



      
 

 



 

representatives not to, disclose, permit to be disclosed, use, permit to be
used, copy or permit to be copied, any trade secrets and or proprietary or
confidential information relating to the Assets, except for disclosures and
uses required by Law or stock exchange rules.

 



 

(b) _Non-Solicitation of Employees; Employee Matters_. For a period of one (1)
year after the Execution Date, Buyer will not solicit for employment any of
Sellers employees other than the individuals listed on _Schedule 9.3(b)_ ,
without obtaining the prior written consent of Seller, provided, however, that
such restrictions shall not apply with respect to (1) an employee of a Seller
or any of its Affiliates whose employment has been involuntarily terminated by
Seller or such Affiliate, (2) an employee of Seller or any of its Affiliates
who has voluntarily terminated employment or (3) any Person who responds to a
general solicitation that is not specifically directed at such Persons. With
respect to the individuals listed on _Schedule 9.3(b)_ (" ** _Permitted
Employees_** ") (which list of Permitted Employees on _Schedule 9.3(b)_ may
be amended to add individuals to _Schedule 9.3(b)_ as Permitted Employees by
Seller from time to time after the Execution Date, provided that the effect of
any change thereto shall only be prospective in nature), Buyer will notify and
coordinate with Seller prior to contacting any such individuals, and Seller
shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in making such Permitted Employees
available to Buyer for interviews. Buyer shall have the option to offer
employment to any Permitted Employee, which employment shall commence as of
the Closing. At least three days prior to Closing, Buyer shall provide Seller
lists of the Permitted Employees who accepted offers of employment from Buyer
as of the Closing, and Permitted Employees who were not offered employment
with Buyer or who have rejected such offers of employment with Buyer. On or
immediately prior to the Closing, Seller shall terminate the employment of
each Permitted Employee who has accepted employment with Buyer as of the
Closing.

 



 

(c) _Bonds_. Within ten (10) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide
replacement credit support or coverage for the bonds, guarantees, letters of
credit and other similar credit support instruments listed on _Schedule

similar credit support instruments cover or pertain to the Assets (" **
_Seller s Bonds_**"), and provide to Seller evidence of Buyers request for
the replacement of Sellers Bonds. Buyer shall use commercially reasonably
efforts to assist Seller in releasing Sellers Bonds to the extent the same
apply solely to the Assets. Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any cost incurred
by Seller following the date that is ninety (90) days after the Closing Date
with respect to Sellers renewal of any of the Sellers Bonds to the extent
attributable to Buyers failure to obtain any such replacement Sellers Bond.

 



 

9.4 _Covenants and Agreements of the Parties_.

 



 

(a) _Announcements_. Each Party shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates not
to) make any press release or other public announcement regarding the
existence of this Agreement, the contents hereof or the Transaction without
the prior written consent of the other Party; _provided, however_ , that the
foregoing shall in no way restrict the following: (i) any disclosure of the
existence of this Agreement and the Transaction by a Party pursuant to a press
release or other public announcement to the extent that the other Party is not
identified in such disclosure, (ii) disclosure to the extent necessary for a
Party to perform its obligations under this Agreement, (iii) disclosure to the
extent required by applicable securities or other Laws or regulations or the
applicable rules of any stock exchange having jurisdiction over the Parties or
their respective Affiliates, or (iv) disclosure to the extent, subject to this
_Section 9.4(a)_, such Party has given the other Party a reasonable
opportunity to review such disclosure prior to its release and no objection is
raised; and _provided, further_ , that, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii),
each Party shall use its reasonable efforts to consult with the other Party
regarding the contents of any such release or announcement prior to

 



      
 

 



 

making such release or announcement and, in the case of clause (iii) the Party
making any such disclosure shall not identify the other Party except as
required by Law or the applicable stock exchange rules. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except as required by Law or the
applicable stock exchange rules or as may be solicited or encouraged by the
applicable stock exchange administrative body, neither Party shall be
permitted to make any press release or other public announcement regarding the
existence of this Agreement, the contents hereof or the Transaction within
three Business Days after the Execution Date without the prior written consent
of the other Party, which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of
such other Party, regardless of any of the permitted disclosures contemplated
by this _Section 9.4(a)_.

 



 

(b) _Casualty Loss_. Prior to Closing, if a portion of the Assets is destroyed
by fire or other casualty or if a portion of the Assets is taken or threatened
to be taken in condemnation or under the right of eminent domain (" **
_Casualty Loss_** "), Buyer shall not be obligated to purchase such Assets. If
Buyer declines to purchase any such Asset, it will be considered a Retained
Asset and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such
Asset. If Buyer elects to purchase such Asset, the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the estimated cost to repair such Asset (with equipment of similar
utility) (or, if such Casualty Loss has resulted in a total loss to such
Asset, by the Allocated Value of such Asset), less all insurance proceeds
which shall be payable to Buyer, up to the Allocated Value thereof (the
reduction being the " ** _Net Casualty Loss_** "). Seller, at its sole option,
may elect to cure such Casualty Loss prior to the Closing and, in such event,
Seller shall be entitled to all insurance proceeds. If Seller elects to cure
such Casualty Loss prior to Closing, Seller may replace any personal property
that is the subject of a Casualty Loss with equipment of similar grade and
utility. If Seller elects to cure the Casualty Loss, and the Casualty Loss is
cured prior to Closing, Buyer shall purchase the affected Asset at Closing for
the Allocated Value thereof.

 



 

(c) _Prior Period Adjustments_. After Closing, Seller shall handle all joint
interest audits and other audits of Property Expenses covering only the period
prior to the Effective Time and Buyer shall handle all joint interest audits
and other audits of Property Expenses covering any other period; provided,
that Buyer shall not agree to a compromise of any audit claims to which Seller
would be entitled, without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Upon determination
that any adjustment to accounting or payments for the period prior to the
Effective Time should be made, Seller shall notify Buyer or Buyer shall notify
Seller, and within 60 days after notification, Buyer shall calculate the
required adjustments (including information regarding any adjustments to
suspense accounts) and any funds required for Buyer to make such payments, and
notify Seller of amounts due from Seller. Within 30 days after notification,
or 90 days after Seller first notifies Buyer of the final determination by
Seller that an adjustment to accounting or payments for the period prior to
the Effective Time should be made, whichever is later, Seller shall pay to
Buyer such amounts it owes, plus any interest due. Without limiting the
Parties rights under _Section 2.3(h)_, following such payment by Seller,
Seller shall have no further obligation or liability with respect to such
adjustments to accounting or payments for the period prior to the Effective
Time.

 



 

9.5 _HSR Act_. If applicable, no sooner than four Business Days but no later
than ten days after the Execution Date, Buyer and Seller will each prepare and
simultaneously file with the United States Department of Justice (" ** _DOJ_**
") and the United States Federal Trade Commission (" ** _FTC_** ") the
notification and report form required for the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 ("
** _HSR Act_** ") and request early termination of the waiting period
thereunder. Buyer and Seller agree to respond promptly to any inquiries from
the DOJ or the FTC concerning such filings and to comply in all material
respects with the filing requirements of the HSR Act. Buyer and Seller shall
cooperate with each other and shall promptly furnish all information to the
other

 



      
 

 



 

Party that is necessary in connection with Buyers and Sellers compliance
with the HSR Act. Buyer and Seller shall keep each other fully advised with
respect to any requests from or communications with the DOJ or FTC concerning
such filings and shall consult with each other with respect to all responses
thereto. Each of Seller and Buyer shall use its reasonable efforts to take all
actions reasonably necessary and appropriate in connection with any HSR Act
filing to consummate the transactions consummated hereby; provided, however,
that in no event will either Party be required to agree to any divestiture,
transfer or licensing of its properties, assets or businesses, or to the
imposition of any limitation on the ability of any of the foregoing to conduct
its businesses or to own or exercise control of its assets and properties. The
filing fees associated with any such HSR Act filing shall be borne 50% by each
of the Parties.

for, any Transfer Taxes required to be paid in connection with the sale or
transfer of the Assets pursuant to this Agreement. " ** _Transfer Taxes_** "

and at the time of such assertion of termination Buyer has no existing right
to assert termination under _Section 12.1(c)_ or _Section 12.1(d)_, and, in

receive the Performance Deposit (including all interest accrued thereto, if
any) as liquidated damages, as Sellers sole remedy at Law and in equity, and
the Parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver the Performance Deposit
to Seller. The Parties agree that the damages that would be suffered by Seller

of such damages and do not constitute a penalty.

 



 

(c) If this Agreement terminates for reasons other than those set forth in

Agent to deliver the Performance Deposit to Buyer, free of any claims by
Seller or any other Person with respect thereto, and each Party hereto shall

ARTICLE 14 
POST-CLOSING OBLIGATIONS

 



 

14.1 _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 



 

(a) _Final Settlement Statement_. As soon as practicable after the Closing,
but in no event later than one hundred twenty (120) days after Closing, or
thirty (30) days after resolution of all Disputed Defect Amounts, whichever is
later, Seller, with the assistance of Buyers staff and with access to such
records as reasonably necessary, will cause to be prepared in good faith and
delivered to Buyer, in accordance with customary industry accounting
practices, a final settlement statement (" ** _Final Settlement Statement_**
") setting forth each adjustment to the Purchase Price in final form in
accordance with _Section 2.3_ and showing the calculation of such adjustments
and the resulting final Purchase Price (" ** _Final Purchase Price_** "). As
soon as practicable after receipt of the Final Settlement Statement but in no
event later than on or before thirty (30) days after receipt of such
statement, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a written report containing any
changes that Buyer proposes to make to the Final Settlement Statement. Buyers
failure to deliver to Seller a written report detailing proposed changes to
the Final Settlement Statement by that date shall be deemed an acceptance by
Buyer of the Final Settlement Statement as submitted by Seller. Subject to
_Section 14.1(b)_, the Parties shall agree with respect to the changes
proposed by Buyer, if any, no later than thirty (30) days after Sellers
receipt of Buyers proposed changes to the Final Settlement Statement. The
date upon which such agreement is reached or upon which the Final Purchase
Price is established pursuant to _Section 14.1(b)_ in the case of a dispute
(as applicable) is the " ** _Final Settlement Date_**." If the Final Purchase
Price is more than the Closing Amount, Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of
such difference by wire transfer in immediately available funds no later than
five (5) Business Days after the Final Settlement Date. If the Final Purchase
Price is less than the Closing Amount, Seller shall pay the amount of such
difference to Buyer by wire transfer in immediately available funds no later
than five (5) Business Days after the Final Settlement Date.

 



 

(b) _Dispute Resolution_. If the Parties are unable to resolve a dispute as to
the Final Settlement Statement, within thirty (30) days after Sellers receipt
of Buyers proposed changes to the Final Settlement Statement, the Parties
shall submit the dispute to binding arbitration by an accounting firm to be
conducted in accordance with the provisions of _Schedule 14.1(b)_.

 



 

14.2 _Release of Defect Escrow Amounts; Assignment of Disputed Asset_. Upon
determination of a Disputed Defect Amount in accordance with _Section 6.1_,
Seller and Buyer shall direct the Escrow Agent to distribute the applicable
funds by wire transfer in immediately available funds, as follows:

 



 

(a) If the applicable Expert determines the actual defect amount for a
Disputed Asset is less than the Individual Title Defect Threshold, the
Allocated Value for the Disputed Asset shall be released to Seller.

 



 

(b) If the applicable Expert determines the actual defect amount for a
Disputed Asset is less than the Disputed Defect Amount, to the extent the
actual defect amount (together with all other Title Defect Amounts and
Environmental Defect Amounts as mutually agreed or determined by the
applicable Expert) exceeds the Title Defect Deductible or the Environmental
Defect Deductible, as applicable, the amount exceeding the Title Defect
Deductible or the Environmental Defect Deductible, as applicable, shall be
released to Buyer, and the remainder of the Allocated Value for the Disputed
Asset shall be released to Seller.

 



 

(c) If the applicable Expert determines the actual defect amount for a
Disputed Asset is equal to the Disputed Defect Amount, to the extent the
Disputed Defect Amount (together with

 



      
 

 



 

all other Title Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect Amounts as mutually
agreed or determined by the applicable Expert) exceeds the Title Defect
Deductible or the Environmental Defect Deductible, as applicable, the amount
exceeding the Title Defect Deductible or the Environmental Defect Deductible,
as applicable, shall be released to Buyer, and the remainder of the Allocated
Value for the Disputed Asset shall be released to Seller.

 



 

(d) If the applicable Expert determines that there is no Disputed Defect
Amount, the Allocated Value for the Disputed Asset shall be released to
Seller.

 



 

(e) If the Closing on the Disputed Assets does not occur and this Agreement is
terminated, the Allocated Values for the Disputed Assets held by the Escrow
Agent shall be released to Buyer.

 



 

14.3 _Records_. Seller shall provide electronic Records within five (5)
Business Days after Closing and shall make the Records available for pick-up
by Buyer within thirty (30) days after Closing. If Seller delivers the Records
to Buyer at Buyers expense, Seller may retain copies of the Records and
Seller shall have the right to review and copy the Records during standard
business hours upon reasonable notice for so long as Buyer retains the
Records. Buyer agrees that the Records will be maintained by Buyer or its
successors or assigns in compliance with all applicable Laws governing
document retention and that Buyer or its successors or assigns shall make
available to Seller (and its Affiliates and its and their representatives),
upon the reasonable request of Seller and during ordinary business hours, all
Records that relate to the Retained Liabilities for a period of seven (7)
years. Seller shall retain for a period of seven (7) years and shall make
available to Buyer (or its applicable successors or assigns and their
Affiliates and their representatives), upon the reasonable request of Buyer
and during ordinary business hours, any records retained by Seller that relate
to the Assets or the Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

14.4 _Assumption of Plugging Liabilities and Reclamation Obligation_. Upon
Closing, but subject and without prejudice to Buyers rights to
indemnification under _Article 15_, Buyer assumes hereby any and all plugging
and abandonment obligations of Seller associated with the Wells. In addition,
Buyer assumes hereby any and all reclamation obligations of Seller for the
Reclamation Wells identified in _Exhibit B-2_, regardless of when the
obligations arose. Plugging and abandonment obligations shall mean all usual
and normal prudent operations for the plugging, abandonment, surface
restoration, site clearance, and disposal of related waste materials,
including, without limitation, NORM and asbestos, and of all oil, gas,
injection, water or other wells, sumps, pits, ponds, tanks, impoundments,
foundations, pipelines, structures and equipment of any kind or description on
the Assets, in compliance with all applicable contractual obligations and
applicable rules and regulations of Governmental Authorities having
jurisdiction over the Assets. Reclamation obligations shall mean all usual and
normal surface restoration operations in accordance with the requirements of
any Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction over the Reclamation Wells.

 



 

14.5 _Suspense Funds_. At the Closing, Seller will provide to Buyer (a)
Sellers division of interest and all supporting documentation regarding those
royalty owners and working interest owners in the Leases for whom Seller
disburses proceeds of production and (b) information regarding all Suspense
Funds. Subject to Buyers rights to indemnification under _Article 15_ and
except for Retained Liabilities, Buyer agrees to take and apply the Suspense
Funds in a manner consistent with prudent oil and gas business practices and
the information supplied by Seller and to indemnify Seller against any claim
relating to the failure to pay such funds after the Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE 15 
ASSUMPTION AND RETENTION OF OBLIGATIONS AND INDEMNIFICATION; DISCLAIMERS

 



 

15.1 _Buyer s Assumption of Liabilities and Obligations_. Subject to Buyers
rights to indemnification under this _Article 15_ and except for Retained
Liabilities, upon Closing, Buyer shall assume and pay, perform, fulfill and
discharge all claims, costs, expenses, liabilities and obligations (" **
_Obligations_** ") relating to (a) the ownership and operation of the Assets
prior to and after the Effective Time including the owning, developing,
exploring, operating or maintaining the Assets or the producing, gathering,
transporting, treating, processing and marketing of Hydrocarbons from the
Assets, including the payment of Property Expenses (including any volumetric
payments, aid in construction payments, annual demand charges, and other
similar payments) and the payment of Burdens; (b) the obligation to plug and
abandon all Wells located on the Lands and reclaim all Well sites located on
the Lands (including the Reclamation Wells); (c) the obligation to restore,
remove and/or reclaim all Equipment, reservoirs, pits, ponds and other
structures and facilities related to the Assets; and (d) the Buyers
Environmental Liabilities (collectively, but excluding the Retained
Liabilities, the " ** _Assumed Liabilities_** "). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, there shall be no duplication among the
Assumed Liabilities, adjustments to the Purchase Price, the rights and
obligations of the Parties under _Section 2.3(h)_, and Buyers obligation to
indemnify Seller.

 



 

15.2 _Seller s Retention of Liabilities and Obligations_. Upon Closing,
Seller shall retain and pay, perform, fulfill and discharge all Obligations of
Seller relating to (i) any tax (including any tax imposed on Seller or
otherwise imposed on the Assets or with respect to the business of Seller),
including without limitation Obligations of Seller for the taxes of any other
person under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign Law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or
otherwise, but excluding any Asset Taxes or Property Taxes to the extent
allocated to Buyer pursuant to _Article 10_ (" ** _Seller Taxes_** "), (ii)
the Retained Assets, (iii) Subject to _Section 2.3(h)_, Property Expenses
related to the period prior to the Effective Time, (iv) the payment of Burdens
on production from or attributable to the Assets accruing prior to the
Effective Time, (v) personal injury, illness, death, or damage to personal
property attributable to the Assets operated by Seller to the extent arising
or accruing prior to the Closing, (vi) all litigation, actions, suits,
proceedings, claims and/or administrative proceedings set forth on _Schedule
7.6_ , and such matters that if not set forth on such schedule, cause Seller
to be in breach of its representation in _Section 7.6_, (vii) the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of Seller or any of its Affiliates in
connection with the use, ownership or operation of the Assets prior to the
Closing Date, (viii) Hazardous Substances related or attributable to the
Assets that, prior to the Closing, were disposed of by Seller or its designee
off-site of the Assets, or (ix) any civil or administrative fines or penalties
or criminal sanctions imposed on any Buyer Indemnified Party arising out of or
related to Sellers pre-Closing conduct (collectively, the " ** _Retained
Liabilities_** "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
there shall be no duplication among the Retained Liabilities, adjustments to
the Purchase Price, the rights and obligations of the Parties under _Section
2.3(h)_, and Sellers obligations to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties.

 



 

15.3 _Indemnification_. " ** _Losses_** " shall mean any actual losses, costs,
expenses (including court costs, reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys,
technical experts and expert witnesses and the cost of investigation),
liabilities, damages, demands, suits, claims, awards, judgments and sanctions
of every kind and character (including civil fines) arising from, related to
or reasonably incident to matters indemnified against; excluding however any
special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages except to the extent any
such Person suffers such damages (including costs of defense and reasonable
attorneys fees incurred in connection with the defense of such damages) to a
Third Party, which damages (including costs of defense and reasonable
attorneys fees incurred in connection with the defense of such damages) shall
not be excluded by this provision as to recovery hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

After the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall indemnify each other as follows:

 



 

(a) _Seller s Indemnification of Buyer_. Seller assumes all risk, liability,
obligation and Losses in connection with, and shall defend, indemnify, and
save and hold harmless, Buyer and its Affiliates, and their respective
officers, directors, employees and agents (collectively, the " ** _Buyer
Indemnified Parties_** "), from and against all Losses which arise directly or
indirectly from or in connection with (i) the Retained Liabilities, (ii) any
matter for which Seller has expressly agreed to indemnify Buyer under this
Agreement, (iii) any breach by Seller of any of Sellers representations,
warranties hereunder or under any Transaction Document, and (iv) any failure
of Seller to perform Sellers covenants hereunder.

 



 

(b) _Buyer s Indemnification of Seller_. Buyer assumes all risk, liability,
obligation and Losses in connection with, and shall defend, indemnify, and
save and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, employees and agents (collectively, the " ** _Seller
Indemnified Parties_** "), from and against all Losses which arise directly or
indirectly from or in connection with (i) the Assumed Liabilities, (ii) any
matter for which Buyer has agreed to indemnify Seller under this Agreement,
(iii) any breach by Buyer of any of Buyers representations, warranties
hereunder or under any Transaction Document, and (iv) any failure of Buyer to
perform Buyers covenants hereunder; but excepting, in each case, Losses with
respect to which Seller is required to indemnify the Buyer or its officers,
directors, employees and agents and Affiliates pursuant to _Article 15_ or
otherwise pursuant to this Agreement or any Transaction Document.

 



 

(c) The indemnities in _Section 15.3(a)_ and _Section 15.3(b)_ shall
terminate at the end of the Survival Period (as set forth in _Section 16.14_)
of each respective representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is
subject to indemnification thereunder, except in each case as to matters for
which a specific written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the
Indemnifying Party on or before such termination date.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall Seller have
any liability for indemnification under _Section 15.3(a)(iii)_: (a) for any
individual Claim that does not exceed Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($400,000)
in Losses (" ** _Individual Claim Threshold_** "); and (b) until and unless
the aggregate amount of the liability for Losses related to such Claims that
meet or exceed the Individual Claim Threshold exceeds one and a half percent
(1.5%) of the unadjusted Purchase Price (" ** _Aggregate Claim Deductible_**
"), and then only to the extent such Losses exceed the Aggregate Claim
Deductible. The maximum liability of Seller for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 15.3(a)(iii)_ with respect to Losses suffered by the Buyer shall not
exceed ten percent (10%) of the unadjusted Purchase Price (" **
_Indemnification Cap_** "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
nothing in this _Section 15.3(d)_ shall limit Sellers liability for
indemnification under _Section 15.3(a)(iii)_ for any breach of any
Fundamental Representation.

 



 

(e) The amount of any Losses for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnity under this _Article 15_ shall be reduced by the amount of insurance
proceeds realized by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates with respect to
such Losses (net of any collection costs, and excluding the proceeds of any
insurance policy issued or underwritten by the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates).

 



 

(f) In no event shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to duplicate
compensation with respect to the same Loss, liability, damage, cost, expense,
claim, under more than one provision of this Agreement and the various
documents delivered in connection with the Closing, or for which an
Indemnified Party received the benefits of an adjustment to the Purchase Price
pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

15.4 _Procedure_. The indemnifications contained in _Section 15.3_ shall be
implemented as follows:

 



 

(a) _Claim Notice_. The Seller Indemnified Party or Buyer Indemnified Party
seeking indemnification under the terms of this Agreement (" ** _Indemnified
Party_** ") shall submit a written " ** _Claim Notice_** " to the other Party
(" ** _Indemnifying Party_** ") which, to be effective, must be delivered
prior to the end of the Survival Period and must state: (i) to the extent
reasonably possible the amount of each payment claimed by an Indemnified Party
to be owing, (ii) to the extent reasonably possible the basis for such claim,
with supporting documentation, and (iii) a list identifying to the extent
reasonably possible each separate item of Loss for which payment is so
claimed. The amount claimed to the extent not reasonably expected to be
covered by insurance shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the extent
required herein within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim Notice, or
after the amount of such payment has been finally established as provided in
_Section 15.4(c)_, whichever last occurs.

 



 

(b) _Information_. Within thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party
receives notice of a claim or legal action by a Third Party that may result in
a Loss for which indemnification may be sought under this _Article 15_ (a "
** _Claim_** "), the Indemnified Party shall give written notice of such Claim
to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party or its counsel so
requests, the Indemnified Party shall furnish the Indemnifying Party with
copies of all pleadings and other information with respect to such Claim. At
the election of the Indemnifying Party, which must be made within sixty (60)
days after receipt of such notice and not thereafter, the Indemnified Party
shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume control of such Claim (to the
extent only that such Claim, legal action or other matter relates to a Loss
for which the Indemnifying Party is liable), including the determination of
all appropriate actions, the negotiation of settlements on behalf of the
Indemnified Party, and the conduct of litigation through attorneys of the
Indemnifying Partys choice; _provided, however_ , that no such settlement can
result in any liability or cost to the Indemnified Party for which it is not
entitled to be indemnified hereunder or impose any remedy other than damages
without its prior written consent. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume
control, (i) all reasonable expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the investigation or defense of the Claim, legal action or
other matter prior to the time the Indemnifying Party assumes control shall be
reimbursed and paid by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) any expenses incurred by
the Indemnified Party thereafter for investigation or defense of the matter
shall be borne by the Indemnified Party except for reasonable expenses
incurred in connection with providing information or assistance to the
Indemnifying Party as required by this _Section 15.4(b),_ and (iii) the
Indemnified Party shall give all reasonable information and assistance, other
than pecuniary, that the Indemnifying Party shall deem necessary to the proper
defense of such Claim, legal action, or other matter but shall be reimbursed
and paid for such expenses as provided for in this _Section 15.4(b)_. Before
such election is made or in the absence of such an election, the Indemnified
Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to defend any claim, legal action
or other matter and shall be reimbursed and paid by the Indemnifying Party for
all reasonable expenses incurred in such defense. Before such election is made
or in the absence of such election, the Indemnified Party may settle any
Claim, legal action or other matter for which notice has been provided as
required by _Section 15.4(a)_, but only with the consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. If such a Claim
requires immediate action, both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party will cooperate in good faith to take appropriate action so as not to
jeopardize defense of such Claim or either Partys position with respect to
such Claim.

 



 

(c) _Dispute_. If the existence of a valid Claim or amount to be paid by an
Indemnifying Party is in dispute, the provisions of _Section 16.9_ shall
apply.

 



      
 

 



 

15.5 _No Insurance; Subrogation_. The indemnifications provided in this
_Article 15_ shall not be construed as a form of insurance. Buyer and Seller
hereby waive for themselves, their successors or assigns, including any
insurers, any rights to subrogation for Losses for which each of them is
respectively liable or against which each respectively indemnifies the other,
and, if required by applicable policies, Buyer and Seller shall obtain waiver
of such subrogation from its respective insurers.

 



 

15.6 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification payments
made pursuant to this _Article 15_ shall be treated by the Parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by applicable Law.

 



 

15.7 _Reservation as to Non-Parties_. Nothing herein is intended to limit or
otherwise waive any recourse Buyer or Seller may have against any Person that
is not a Party for any obligations or liabilities that may be incurred with
respect to the Assets.

 



 

15.8 _Express Negligence_. THE INDEMNIFICATION, RELEASE, ASSUMED LIABILITIES,
WAIVER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVISIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT
SHALL BE APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT THE LIABILITIES, LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES
AND DAMAGES IN QUESTION AROSE OR RESULTED SOLELY OR IN PART FROM THE SOLE,
JOINT, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT, CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE,
STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY INDEMNIFIED
PARTY OR ANY OTHER PERSON, AND WHETHER ANY LIABILITY OR CLAIM IS IN TORT,
UNDER CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE AT LAW, BUT SHALL NOT BE APPLICABLE TO THE EXTENT
OF THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY. BUYER
AND SELLER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS STATEMENT COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS
NEGLIGENCE RULE AND IS CONSPICUOUS.

 



 

15.9 _Materiality_. For purposes of this _Article 15_, any claim of, and Loss
resulting from, any breach or inaccuracy in the representations and warranties
under this Agreement and the corresponding representations and warranties
given in the certificates to be delivered by Seller at Closing pursuant to
_Section 11.2(a)_ shall be determined without regard to any materiality
qualifiers in or affecting such representations or warranties.

unconditionally guarantees the full and prompt payment and performance of all
obligations of Seller under this Agreement and the other agreements entered
into with respect to the Transaction (the " ** _Guaranteed Obligations_** "),
regardless of the financial capability, insolvency or bankruptcy of Seller.
This is a guaranty of payment and not of performance or collection.

 



 

(b) WPXs obligations are primary obligations and not those of a mere surety.
Upon default by Seller with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations,

to proceed against Seller, and may proceed directly against WPX without
proceeding against Seller or any other Person or pursuing any other remedy.

 



 

(c) WPXs obligations hereunder shall not be affected by the commencement of
any proceedings by or against Seller under the Bankruptcy Code (U.S.C. Title
11) or any other liquidation, conservatorship, bankruptcy, moratorium,
rearrangement, receivership, insolvency, reorganization or similar debtor
relief Laws affecting the rights of creditors generally, any stay or ruling
thereunder, or the disallowance of any claim thereunder. If all or any part of
any payment to or for the benefit of Buyer in respect of the Guaranteed
Obligations shall be invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential,
set aside or required for any reason to be repaid or paid to a trustee,
receiver or other Third Party, then the Guaranteed Obligations which otherwise
would have been satisfied by that payment or partial payment shall be revived
and continue in full force and effect as if that payment had not been made.
WPX shall be fully and primarily liable for such Guaranteed Obligations and
indemnify Buyer accordingly.

 



 

(d) Buyer may, without notice to or consent of WPX (i) extend or alter,
together with Seller, the time, manner, place or terms of payment or
performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) waive, or, together with
Seller, amend any terms of this Agreement or any other agreement executed
pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) release Seller from any or all Guaranteed
Obligations, or (iv) release any other guarantee or security for the
Guaranteed Obligations, without in any way changing, releasing or discharging
WPX from liability hereunder. WPX hereby waives notice of the acceptance of
the guarantee provided by this _Section 16.20_, presentment, demand, protest,
and notices of protest, nonpayment, default or dishonor of the Guaranteed
Obligations, and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever
with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, as well as the benefits of Chapter
34 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code and Rule 31 of the Texas Rules of
Civil Procedures, and of any similar statutes. Nothing in this _Section
16.20_ shall limit or otherwise affect the rights of Seller under the terms of
this Agreement.

 



 

(e) WPX represents and warrants to Buyer that (i) WPX has received, or will
receive, direct or indirect benefit from the making of this undertaking; (ii)
WPX is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation; (iii) WPX has the
requisite corporate power to enter into this Agreement and to perform its
obligations under this _Section 16.20_; (iv) the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of WPX; and (v) this Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by WPX and constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of WPX, enforceable against WPX in accordance with its terms.

 



 

(f) Notices and other communications hereunder to WPX shall be delivered to
WPX Energy, Inc., Attention: Treasury Group, 3500 One Williams Center, Suite
2600, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74172, with a copy to the Attention: Legal Counsel, 3500
