<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties and
covenants contained herein, the VGPO and EPIC agree as follows:</P>

<P align="center">SECTION 1- THE MERGER</P>

Agreement, and in accordance with the Laws of the State of Florida ("FLCL") and
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("DGCL"), VGPO shall be
merged with and into EPIC (the "Merger"). The Merger shall occur at the

manner provided in Section 1.6.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective Time. As soon as practicable after satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the Merger, the parties shall cause a Certificate of Merger to be
filed in accordance with the DGCL and FLCL (the "Merger Certificate") and shall
take all such further actions as may be required by law to make the Merger
effective. The Merger shall be effective at such time as the Merger Certificate
shall have been filed by the Secretaries of State of Delaware and  Florida in
accordance with the DGCL and FLCL or at such later time as is specified in the
Merger Certificate (the "Effective Time"). Immediately prior to the filing of
the Merger Certificate, a closing (the "Closing") will be held at the offices of
Don A. Paradiso, P.A., 2072 South Military Trail, Suite 9, West Palm Beach,
Florida 33415 (or such other place as the parties may agree) for the purpose of
confirming satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the Merger. Subject to
satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions specified in Sections 6, 7 and
8 hereof, the Closing shall take place within three business days after the last
to occur of:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the day the Merger is approved by the stockholders of EPIC; or</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the day the issuance of the Merger Consideration (as defined below) is
approved by the stockholders of EPIC;</P>

<P>or on such other date as the parties may agree, but not later than January 31,
2002. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing
Date".</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
FLCL and the DGCL.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Certificate of Incorporation
of VGPO, including the Certificate of Designations and the Bylaws of VGPO, in
each case as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation, including the Certificate of Designations and
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time with
all references to Delaware or the DGCL changed to Florida and the FLCL, mutatis
mutandis, until duly amended in accordance with applicable law.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors and Officers. The directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the same as the
directors and officers of VGPO prior to the Effective Time).Norman R. Dobiesz
shall be appointed as interim Chief Executive Officer of EPIC. Each officer and
director shall hold office until his successor shall be duly appointed or
elected, as the case may be, and qualified or until his earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversion of Securities.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this Agreement, "Merger Consideration" means 36,500,000 common shares of stock, $0.001 par value per share, of EPIC ("EPIC Common
Stock"), 100,000 preferred shares of stock, $.001 par value per share, of EPIC
("EPIC Preferred Stock") and warrants, options and other rights to purchase
securities of EPIC ("EPIC Other Rights").</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of VGPO or EPIC:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All shares of Common Stock of VGPO, $0.0001 par value per share (the "VGPO Common Stock"), outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
converted into and become (subject to the payment of cash for fractional shares
as provided in Section 1.10) the like amount of shares of EPIC Common Stock,
subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 1.6(c).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All shares of Preferred Stock of VGPO, $0.0001 par value per share (the "VGPO Preferred Stock"), outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be converted into and become the like amount of shares of EPIC Preferred
Stock subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 1.6(c), and having the
same rights, privileges and designations in every respect as the VGPO Preferred
Stock.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All shares of EPIC Stock held at the Effective Time by EPIC as treasury stock shall be treated as authorized and issued shares.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All warrants, options and other rights to purchase securities of VGPO ("VGPO Other Rights") listed on the VGPO Disclosure Schedule (defined in Section 2) shall be converted into and become the like number of warrants, options and
other rights to purchase securities of EPIC, subject to adjustment in accordance
with Section 1.6(c).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The VGPO Common Stock, VGPO Preferred Stock and VGPO Other Rights shall be collectively referred to as the "VGPO Securities." The EPIC Common Stock, EPIC Preferred Stock and EPIC Other Rights shall be collectively referred to as the "EPIC Securities."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted in the event of any change in the VGPO Securities by reason of a stock split, stock recapitalization,
combination or subdivision of VGPO Securities, merger or other exchange of
shares by operation of law or the like occurring after the date of this
Agreement and before the Effective Time, such that, after the record date
therefor the Merger Consideration shall be equal to the number and class of
shares or other securities or property that would have been received in respect
of VGPO Securities, as the case may be, if the Effective Time had occurred
immediately prior to such record date.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closing of VGPO Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the securities
transfer books of VGPO shall be closed and no transfer of VGPO Securities shall
thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, certificates representing VGPO
Securities are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled
and exchanged for certificates representing EPIC Securities.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issuance of EPIC Certificates. Prior to the Effective Time, EPIC and VGPO
shall mutually agree upon one or more persons to act as Exchange Agent hereunder
(the "Exchange Agent") and shall deposit with or for the account of the Exchange
Agent certificates representing the number of shares of EPIC Securities
comprising the Merger Consideration. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, (i) VGPO shall deliver to EPIC a list of all record holders of VGPO
Securities immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Record Holders"),
setting forth each VGPO Securitiesholder's name, address and number of VGPO
Securities held prior to the Effective Time and such other information as may be
reasonably requested by the Exchange Agent (the "Securities List") and (ii) the
Exchange Agent shall be instructed to mail to each Record Holder a form of
letter of transmittal which shall specify instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of VGPO Securities certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon the Exchange Agent's receipt of the letter of transmittal
and any certificate representing outstanding shares of VGPO Securities held by a
Securitiesholder, each such Securitiesholder shall be entitled to receive a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of EPIC Securities into
which the shares of VGPO Securities as set forth on the Securitiesholder List
shall have been converted pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. The VGPO
Securities outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (and any
certificates representing such shares) shall be deemed converted as of the
Effective Time. EPIC Securities into which VGPO Securities shall be converted in
the Merger shall be deemed to have been issued at the Effective Time.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any EPIC Securities certificates are to be issued in a name other than
that in which the VGPO Securities were registered immediately prior to the
Effective Time, it shall be a condition of such issuance that the person
requesting such issuance shall deliver to the Exchange Agent all documents
necessary to evidence and effect such transfer and shall pay to the Exchange
Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of
certificates for such EPIC Securities in a name other than that of the
registered holder of the certificate so surrendered to establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. None of EPIC, VGPO or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any
Securitiesholder of VGPO for Securities or any cash in lieu of fractional
interests delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable escheat or
abandoned property laws.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Fractional Shares. No certificates representing fractional shares of
EPIC Securities shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of VGPO
Securities certificates. No fractional interest shall entitle the owner to vote
or to any rights of a security holder. In lieu of fractional Securities, each
Securitiesholder who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional
share of EPIC Security will receive from EPIC at Closing an amount in cash
(without interest) determined by multiplying such fraction by the fair market
value of a share of EPIC Securities. Such fair market value shall equal the mean
of the daily high and low sales prices of EPIC Common Stock on the Nasdaq OTC
Bulletin Board, as reported by Nasdaq, averaged over (10) consecutive trading
days, ending on the fifth trading day prior to the Closing Date.</P>

<P align="center">SECTION 2- REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF VGPO</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as set forth on the disclosure schedule (the "VGPO Disclosure Schedule")
delivered to EPIC on the date hereof, VGPO represents and warrants to EPIC as
set forth below:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organization and Qualification. VGPO is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Delaware and has full
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets, properties
and business and to carry on its business as now being and as heretofore
conducted. VGPO does not own any capital stock of any corporation or any
interest in any joint venture, partnership, association, trust or other entity.
VGPO is qualified, licensed or is otherwise authorized to transact business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction (in the United
States and outside of the United States) in which the failure to be so
qualified, licensed or otherwise authorized to transact business and in good
standing would have a material adverse effect on the business or financial
condition of VGPO (an "VGPO Material Adverse Effect"), all of which
jurisdictions are identified in the VGPO Disclosure Schedule.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capitalization.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outstanding Capital Stock. Immediately prior to Closing, VGPO's authorized
capital stock shall consist of 100 million shares of Common Stock, $.000l par
value per share, of which 36,500,000 shares will be issued and outstanding and
20,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $.001, of which 100,000 shares
will be issued and outstanding. VGPO is not aware of any record or beneficial
holder of more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of VGPO Stock
otherwise than as disclosed. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all
outstanding shares of VGPO Common Stock and VGPO Preferred Stock will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable and issued in
compliance with all charter documents of VGPO and all applicable federal and
state laws. There are no restrictions on the transfer of VGPO' s capital stock
other than those arising from securities laws. The VGPO Disclosure Schedule
contains a complete and accurate list of all record and beneficial holders of
VGPO Securities as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the
number of VGPO Securities held by each such holder.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Options or Other Rights. Except as set forth in the VGPO Disclosure
Schedule, no subscription, warrant, option, preemptive right, convertible
security or other right (contingent or otherwise) to purchase or acquire any
shares of capital stock or other security of VGPO issued by VGPO is authorized
or outstanding. Except as set forth in the VGPO Disclosure Schedule, there is no
commitment or offer by VGPO to issue or provide any such subscription, warrant,
option, preemptive right, convertible security or other right or to issue or
distribute to holders of any shares of its capital stock any evidences of
indebtedness or assets of VGPO. VGPO has no obligation (contingent or otherwise)
to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of its capital stock or any
interest therein or to pay any dividend or make any other distribution in
respect thereof. There are no voting trusts, proxies or other agreements,
instruments or understandings with respect to outstanding shares of VGPO's
capital stock to which VGPO is a party.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Authority to Execute and Perform Agreements. Subject to the requirement to obtain approval of its stockholders to consummate the Merger under the DGCL,
VGPO has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and each agreement, document and instrument contemplated by this
Agreement to which it is a party, to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby and to perform fully its obligations hereunder and
thereunder. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of VGPO. The Board
of Directors of VGPO has adopted a resolution approving this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, recommending approval of this Agreement and
the Merger contemplated hereby to the stockholders of VGPO and directing that
this Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of VGPO for their consideration.
This Agreement and each agreement, document and instrument to which it is a
party executed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement constitute, or when
executed and delivered will constitute, valid and binding obligations of VGPO,
enforceable in accordance with their respective terms.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsidiaries and Other Affiliates. VGPO does not have any subsidiary or
directly or indirectly own or have any investment in any of the capital stock
of, or any other interest in, any other entity.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, Books and Records. VGPO has
heretofore delivered or made available to EPIC true and complete copies of its
Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (certified by the Secretary of State of
Delaware) and Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof and corporate minute books.
VGPO is not in default in the performance, observation or fulfillment of either
its Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or Bylaws. The minute books of
VGPO contain true and complete records of all meetings and consents in lieu of
meetings of the Board of Directors and of the stockholders prior to the date
hereof, and accurately reflect all transactions referred to in such minutes and
consents in lieu of meetings.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial Statements. The financial statements (including any related
notes thereto) representing the financial condition of VGPO as of December 31,
2000 and December 31, 1999, respectively (the "VGPO Financials"), (x) were
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except
as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and (y) fairly present the financial
position of VGPO as at the respective dates thereof and the results of its
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the VGPO
Financials were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments
which were not, or are not expected to be, material in amount.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Except for matters reflected or
reserved against, VGPO had no and has not since such date incurred any material
liabilities (either individually or in the aggregate) of any nature, whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise (including without limitation,
liabilities as guarantor or otherwise with respect to obligations of others or
liabilities for taxes due or then accrued or to become due), except as and to
the extent incurred since December 31, 2000 in the ordinary course of business.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Material Adverse Change. Since December 31, 2000, there has not been:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any material adverse change in the assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise), results of operation, business or prospects of VGPO or any
occurrence or circumstance which reasonably could be expected to result in such
a material adverse change;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any material change in the method of operating the business of VGPO or in the manner of keeping the books, accounts or records of VGPO or in any
accounting method or practice of VGPO;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except for the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, any sale, lease, mortgage, pledge,
encumbrance, abandonment or disposition of, or agreement to sell, lease,
mortgage, pledge, encumber, abandon or dispose of, any material assets or
properties of VGPO other than in the ordinary course of business;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except for the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, any material transaction,
commitment, contract or agreement entered into by VGPO, or any relinquishment or
abandonment by VGPO of any material contract or right, or any modification,
waiver, amendment, release, recision, or termination of any material term,
condition or provision of any contract pertaining to VGPO (other than any
satisfaction by performance in accordance with the terms thereof) other than in
the ordinary course of business;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any adverse relationships or conditions with employees, suppliers, lenders or customers of VGPO or any adverse relationships by VGPO with governmental
agencies that could reasonably be anticipated to have an VGPO Material Adverse
Effect;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any acquisition by VGPO (other than property or interests therein acquired in the ordinary course of its business) of all or any part of the assets,
properties, capital stock or business of any other person or entity;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any redemption or other acquisition by VGPO of any of its capital stock or any declaration, setting aside, or payment of any dividend or distribution of
any kind with respect to shares of its capital stock;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(viii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any loan or advance by VGPO to any of its stockholders, officers, directors or consultants, or any other loan or advance other than in the
ordinary course of business; or</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ix)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except as set forth in the VGPO Disclosure Schedule, any new employment or consulting agreement, any increase in compensation, bonus or other benefits
payable or to become payable by VGPO to any of its directors, officers or
employees, other than regularly scheduled increases consistent with past
practice in the ordinary course of business, or any new grant of severance or
termination rights, or increase in rights or benefits payable under existing
severance or termination policies or agreements, to any director, officer or
employee of VGPO.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax Matters.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Taxes required to be paid by VGPO, whether or not shown on any Tax Return, have been paid or VGPO has adequately provided reserves (in accordance
with GAAP). VGPO is not currently the beneficiary of any extension of time
within which to file any Tax Return. No claim has ever been made by any taxing
authority in any jurisdiction that VGPO is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction. VGPO has never been a member of any group required to file any
affiliated, combined, consolidated, or unitary Tax Return.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no liens or other encumbrances with respect to Taxes upon any of the assets or properties of VGPO, other than with respect to Taxes not yet due
and payable.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No deficiency for any Taxes has been proposed in writing against VGPO, which deficiency has not been paid in full. There are not ongoing or, to the
knowledge of VGPO, threatened any audits, examinations, investigations or other
proceedings in respect of Taxes or Tax matters which could result in any tax
deficiency of VGPO for any taxable period ending on or before the date hereof,
and VGPO knows of no basis for the assertion of such a deficiency. To the
knowledge of VGPO, no issue relating to VGPO involving any Tax for which EPIC
might be liable has been resolved in favor of any taxing authority in any audit
or examination which, by application of the same principles applied in the
resolution of such issue, could reasonably be expected to result in a deficiency
for Taxes of EPIC for any period for which the applicable statute of limitations
has not expired.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no outstanding agreements, waivers or arrangements extending the statutory period of limitation applicable to any claim for, or the period for
the collection or assessment of, Taxes due from or with respect to VGPO for any
taxable period, and no power of attorney granted by or with respect to VGPO
relating to Taxes is currently in force.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December 31, 2000, the unpaid Taxes of VGPO did not exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes
established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth
on the face of the Balance Sheet in the VGPO Financials (rather than in any
notes thereof).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No consent to the application of section 341 (f)(2) of the Code (or any predecessor provision) has been made or filed by or with respect to VGPO or any
of its assets or properties. None of the assets or properties of VGPO are or
will be required to be treated as being (i) owned by any other person pursuant
to the provisions of section 1 68(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as
amended, and in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of
1986, or (ii) tax-exempt use property within the meaning of section 168(h)(1) of
the Code. VGPO has not agreed, nor is it required, to make any adjustment under
Section 48 1(a) of the Code by reason of a change in accounting method or
otherwise.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VGPO has not been and is not currently in violation (or, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would be in violation) of any applicable law or
regulation relating to the payment or withholding of Taxes, and all withholding
and payroll Tax requirements required to be complied with by VGPO up to and
including the date hereof have been satisfied.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VGPO is not and has never been a party to or bound by, nor does it have or has it ever had any obligation under, any Tax sharing agreement or similar
contract or arrangement.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no contract or agreement, plan, or arrangement by VGPO concerning any person that, individually or collectively, would reasonably be expected to
give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible by VGPO by
reason of Section 280G of the Code.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VGPO is not and has not been a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the
applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code. EPIC shall
have received (a) a certification from VGPO, dated no more than thirty (30) days
prior to the Effective Time and signed by a responsible corporate officer of
VGPO, that VGPO is not, and has not been at any time during the five years
preceding the date of such certification, a United States real property holding
company, as defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code, and (b) proof reasonably
satisfactory to EPIC that VGPO has provided notice of such certification to the
IRS in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1 .897-2(h)(2).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As used in this Agreement, (1) "Tax Return" means any return, declaration,
report, claim for refund, information return, or statement, and any schedule,
attachment, or amendment thereto, including without limitation any consolidated,
combined or unitary return or other document (including any related or
supporting information), filed or required to be filed by any taxing authority
in connection with the determination, assessment, collection, imposition,
payment, refund or credit of any federal, state, local or foreign Tax or the
administration of the laws relating to any Tax, and (ii) "Tax" or "Taxes" means
any and all taxes, charges, fees, levies, deficiencies or other assessments of
whatever kind or nature including, without limitation, all net income, gross
income, profits, gross receipts, excise, real or personal property, sales, ad
valorem, withholding, social security, retirement, excise, employment,
unemployment, minimum estimated, severance, stamp, property, occupation,
environmental, windfall profits, use, service, net worth, payroll, franchise,
license, gains, customs, transfer, recording and other taxes, customs, duty,
fees, assessments or charges of any kind whatsoever, imposed by any taxing
authority, including any liability therefor as a transferee under Section 6901
of the Code or any similar provision of applicable law, as a result of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of applicable law, or as a
result of any Tax sharing or similar agreement, together with any interest,
penalties or additions to tax relating thereto.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compliance with Laws.</P>

structures, any related capitalized items and other tangible property material
to the business of VGPO ("Tangible Property") other than (i) any statutory
Encumbrance arising in the ordinary course of business by operation of law with
respect to a liability that is not yet due or delinquent and (ii) any minor

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public Announcements and Confidentiality. Any press release or other
information to the press or any third party with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall require the prior approval of EPIC

party shall not be prevented from making such disclosure as it shall be advised

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EPIC SEC Filings. Until the Closing Date, EPIC shall furnish VGPO with a
copy of each periodic or current report filed by EPIC under the Securities

Securities Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax Matters. The following provisions shall govern the allocation between
the Surviving Corporation and the holders of the VGPO Securities and the EPIC
Securities prior to the Effective Time ("Securitiesholders") of responsibility
for certain tax matters following the Effective Time:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Surviving Corporation shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for EPIC and VGPO for all periods ending on
or prior to the Effective Time which are due after the Effective Time. Such Tax
Returns shall be provided to the Securitiesholders for the Securitiesholders'
review and comment not later than 30 days prior to the due date for filing such
Tax Returns (including extensions), and the Securitiesholders shall be entitled
to suggest to the Surviving Corporation any reasonable changes to such Tax
Returns. The Securitiesholders and the Surviving Corporation agree to consult
and to resolve in good faith any issue arising as a result of the review of such
Tax Returns and to mutually consent to the filing of such Tax Returns as
promptly as possible. In the event the parties are unable to resolve any dispute
within ten days following the delivery to the Securitiesholders of any such Tax
Return, the Securitiesholders and the Surviving Corporation shall jointly
request the Surviving Corporation's independent accounting firm, or if such firm
is not acceptable to either the Surviving Corporation or the Securitiesholders,
another independent accounting firm appointed by such firm (the "Independent
Accounting Firm") to resolve any issue at least five days before the due date of
such Tax Return, in order that such Tax Return may be timely filed. The party
whose position is farthest from the resolution reached by the Independent
Accounting Firm shall pay the Independent Accounting Firm's fees and expenses,
and the determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be binding on all
parties. The Securitiesholders shall reimburse the Surviving Corporation for
Taxes of VGPO with respect to such periods within fifteen (15) days after
payment by the Surviving Corporation of such Taxes.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Surviving Corporation shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns of VGPO and the Surviving Corporation for
Tax periods which begin before the Effective Time and end after the Effective
Time. The Securitiesholders shall pay to the Surviving Corporation within
fifteen (15) days after the date on which Taxes are paid with respect to such
periods an amount equal to the portion of such Taxes which relates to the
portion of such taxable period ending on the Effective Time. For purposes of
this section, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and
are payable for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on ) the
Effective Time, the portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such
taxable period ending on the Effective Time shall (x) in the case of Taxes other
than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period from the first
day of such taxable period through the Effective Time and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire taxable period, and (y) in the case of
any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed equal to the
amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the
Effective Time (that is, through a closing of the books of the corporation).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Surviving Corporation shall deliver to the Securitiesholders at least 30
days prior to the due date for filing any such Tax Return to which this Section
4.8 relates (including extensions) a statement setting forth the amount of Tax
allocated to the Securitiesholders pursuant to this section (the "Tax
Statement") for such Tax Returns and copies of such Tax Returns. The
Securitiesholders have the right to review such Tax Returns and the Tax
Statement prior to the filing of such Tax Returns and to suggest to the
Surviving Corporation any reasonable changes to such Tax Returns. If the
Securitiesholders agree with the Tax Statement the Securitiesholders shall
promptly pay the amount shown thereon to the Surviving Corporation in accordance
with the above provisions of this Section 5.2 1(b). If the Securitiesholders
disagree with the Tax Statement, the Securitiesholders and the Surviving
Corporation agree to consult and to resolve in good faith any issue arising as a
result of the review of such Tax Returns and the Tax Statement and to mutually
consent to the filing of such Tax Returns as promptly as possible. In the event
the parties are unable to resolve any dispute within ten days following the
delivery to the Securitiesholders of such Tax Returns and the Tax Statement, the
Securitiesholders and the Surviving Corporation shall jointly request the
Independent Accounting Firm then representing the Surviving Corporation to
resolve any issue in dispute as promptly as possible. If the Independent
Accounting Firm is unable to make a determination with respect to any disputed
issue within five business days prior to the due date (including extensions) for
the filing of the Tax Return in question, then the Surviving Corporation may
file such Tax Return on the due date (including extensions) therefor without
such determination having been made and without the Securitiesholders' consent.
Notwithstanding the filing of such Tax Return, the Independent Accounting Firm
shall make a determination with respect to any disputed issue, and the amount of
Taxes that are allocated to the Securitiesholders pursuant to this Section 4.8
shall be as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses
of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid by the party whose position is
farthest from the determination reached by the Independent Accounting Firm.
Nothing in this section shall excuse the Securitiesholders from their
responsibility for their share, as determined in accordance with this Section
4.8, of any such Taxes if the amount of Taxes as ultimately determined (on audit
or otherwise) for the periods covered by such Tax Returns exceeds the amount
determined under this Section.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Surviving Corporation shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by any other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this Section and any audit, litigation, or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes of VGPO. Such cooperation shall include the retention (to
the extent applicable) and (upon the other party's request) the provision of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to the preparation of any
such Tax Return or to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding. The
Securitiesholders agree (a) to retain all books and records, if any, in their
possession with respect to Tax matters pertinent to VGPO relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Effective Time until the expiration of the statute
of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Surviving Corporation, any
extension thereof) of the applicable taxable periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (b) to give the
Surviving Corporation reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the Surviving
Corporation so requests, the Securitiesholders shall allow the Surviving
Corporation to take possession of such books and records.</P>
