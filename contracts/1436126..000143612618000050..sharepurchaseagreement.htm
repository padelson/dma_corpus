applicable, the other members of the Group, that portion of the Indebtedness
payable to the Paid-Out Creditor thereof (which amount shall be the amount set
forth in the applicable Pay-Out Letter) in immediately available funds in such
manner as directed by such Paid-Out Creditor and, subsequent to Closing, the
Corporation shall, as consideration, issue shares in the capital of the
Corporation to the Purchaser equal to the fair market value of such payments
immediately following the acquisition of the Purchased Securities hereunder; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

The Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, as per Vendors' Delegate
instructions, on behalf of the Vendors, the Transaction Bonuses to the account
of the Corporation in accordance with those wire transfer instructions
provided by the Vendors' Delegate, and, in turn, the Corporation shall pay or

applicable amount payable to such Tax Authority in satisfaction of the

certainty, all such amounts so paid shall under this Section 2.5.3(c) shall be
included in Transaction Expenses or purposes of calculating the Aggregate
Purchase Price under Section 2.2 hereof). 

| 
---|--- 

2.6

|

Closing Date Financial Statements 

| 
---|--- 

2.6.1

|

No later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
deliver to the Vendors' Delegate (i) the Closing Date Financial Statements
prepared in accordance with ASPE and the methodology set forth in Schedule 2.2
at the expense of the Major Vendors, and (ii) the calculation of the Closing
Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Transaction Expenses and the Closing
Working Capital based on such Closing Date Financial Statements and the
calculation of the Purchase Price (collectively, the "Closing Calculation").
The Purchaser and the Vendors shall be permitted access to the audit and
related working papers of the Auditors in respect of the Closing Date
Financial Statements in accordance with customary protocols regarding such
access. 

| 
---|--- 

2.6.2

|

The Major Vendors may object to the Closing Calculation by written notice from
the Vendors' Delegate to the Purchaser within sixty (60) days following
receipt thereof, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail those items
or amounts as to which the Vendor objects (the "Objection Notice") and the
Parties shall be deemed to have agreed upon all other items and amounts
contained in such Closing Calculation which are not impacted by items or
amounts objected to in the Objection Notice. If no Objection Notice is made
within the period and in the manner specified in the preceding sentence, or if
the Purchaser and the Vendors' Delegate confirm in writing that they accept
the Closing Calculation prior to the end of such sixty (60) days period, then
the Closing Calculation shall be conclusive, final and binding on all the
Parties without possibility of amendment or appeal and shall constitute the
final Closing Calculation. 

| 
---|--- 

2.6.3

|

If an Objection Notice is delivered in the manner and within the sixty (60)
period specified in the preceding paragraph, the Parties shall in good faith
attempt to resolve any matters in dispute with respect to the Closing
Calculation as promptly as practicable. If the Purchaser and the Vendors'
Delegate are unable to resolve all such items in dispute within thirty (30)
days after the receipt of the Objection Notice giving rise to such dispute,
then those items or calculations in dispute shall be submitted for resolution
within five (5) Business Days following such thirty (30) days period to
Deloitte and Touche LLP or, if they are unwilling or unable to accept the
mandate to resolve the dispute, to such other independent firm of chartered
accountants as the Purchaser and the Vendors' Delegate may agree in writing
or, failing agreement, as appointed by the court (howsoever selected, the
"Independent Firm"). The Independent Firm, acting as an expert and not as
arbitrator, will limit its review only to the specific items or calculations
in dispute (except to the extent that ASPE requires adjustments to other items
as a result thereof). The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Independent Firm to submit its determination or opinion in a written
statement delivered to the Purchaser and the Vendors' Delegate as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) Business Days of the
appointment of such Independent Firm, and such determination or opinion,
together with those items accepted by the Purchaser and the Vendors' Delegate
in respect of the Closing Calculation or otherwise resolved between the
Purchaser and the Vendors' Delegate, shall be conclusive, final and binding on
all the Parties without possibility of amendment or appeal and shall
constitute the final Closing Calculation. 

| 
---|--- 

2.6.4

|

The Parties shall cooperate fully in the preparation of the Closing
Calculation. While the Independent Firm is making its determination hereunder,
the Parties (which for this subsection 2.6.4 shall include the Vendors'
Delegate) shall not communicate with the Independent Firm on the subject
matter of its review, except by joint conference call, joint meeting or letter
with copy simultaneously delivered to the other Parties. 

| 
---|--- 

2.6.5

|

The Parties will bear their respective fees and expenses (including those of
their respective advisors) in preparing, auditing or reviewing, as the case
may be, the Closing Calculation. The fees and expenses of the Independent Firm
will be allocated between the Vendors and the Purchaser as determined (and as
set forth in the final determination) by the Independent Firm based upon the
relative success (in terms of percentages) of each of the Purchaser's claim,
on the one hand, and the Vendors' claim, on the other hand. For example, if
the final determination reflects a sixty-forty (60-40) compromise of the
Parties' claims being determined by the Independent Firm, the Independent Firm
would allocate expenses forty percent (40%) to the Party (i.e. either the
Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Vendors, on the other hand) whose claims
were determined to be sixty percent (60%) successful and sixty percent (60%)
to the Party (i.e. either the Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Vendors, on
the other hand) whose claims were determined to be forty percent (40%)
successful. Vendors shall be liable for fees and expenses owed by the Vendors
to the Independent Firm in accordance with their Common Equity Designated
Percentage. The accounting and audit procedures provided for by this Section
2.6 shall be the exclusive and conclusive methodology for determination of the
matters covered thereby and shall be binding upon the Parties and shall not be
contested by any of them other than as provided for in this Section 2.6. 

| 
---|--- 

2.7

|

Aggregate Purchase Price Adjustments 

| 
---|--- 

2.7.1

|

If the Aggregate Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.6,
is less than the Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price (such difference,
represented by a positive number, being the "Over Payment"), then, within five
(5) Business Days following such final determination, Purchaser and Vendor's
Delegate, shall give joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

to release from the Adjustment Holdback an amount equal to the Over Payment
(or the entire Adjustment Holdback, to the extent the Over Payment is not less
than the Adjustment Holdback amount) by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account specified by Purchaser; and 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

to release the remaining Adjustment Holdback, if any, to the Major Vendors in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement and their Common Equity Designated
Percentage. 

| 
---|--- 

2.7.2

|

If the Over Payment exceeds the Adjustment Holdback, then the Major Vendors
shall, within five (5) Business Days following the final determination, make
payment by wire transfer to Purchaser in immediately available funds of such
excess. 

| 
---|--- 

2.7.3

|

If the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.6, is
greater than the Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price (such difference,
represented by a positive number, being the "Under Payment"), then, within
five (5) Business Days following such final determination, 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Purchaser shall make payment by wire transfer to Vendors' Delegate for the
benefit of the Major Vendors, in immediately available funds, of an amount
equal to the Under Payment (and which amount shall subsequently be distributed
by Vendors' Delegate to the Major Vendors based on their respective Common
Equity Designated Percentages or as otherwise agreed by the Major Vendors) ;
and 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Purchaser and Vendors' Delegate, shall give written instructions to the Escrow
Agent to release the Adjustment Holdback to Major Vendors, in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement and their Common Equity Designated Percentage of such
amount. 

| 
---|--- 

2.8

|

Withholding 

Each of Purchaser, its Affiliates, Escrow Agent and, effective upon the
Closing, the Company, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
each of Purchaser, its Affiliates, the Escrow Agent and, effective upon the
Closing, the Company, respectively, is required to deduct and withhold under
the Tax Act, Code, or any Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment.
Before making any such deduction or withholding, Purchaser, its Affiliates
(including, from and after the Closing, the Corporation), the Escrow Agent or
their agents, as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
notify Vendors of the intention to make such deduction or withholding. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

Disclosure 

Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule hereto referenced by or to a
particular Article or Section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been
disclosed with respect to every other Article or Section in this Agreement to
the extent (but only to the extent) that it is readily apparent on its face
that such fact or item is relevant as disclosure to such other Article or
Section. The specification of any dollar amount in the representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item

or lower amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are not
material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or

3.4

|

Survival of Representations and Warranties 

| 
---|--- 

3.4.1

|

Major Vendors and Corporation. All representations and warranties made by the
Vendors and the Corporation in this Agreement shall survive the Closing as
follows: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1.1 (a), 3.1.1 (b),
3.1.1 (c) (i) (1), 3.1.1 (c) (i) (2), 3.1.1 (c) (ii), 3.1.3, 3.1.4, 3.1.8 (a),
3.1.9, 3.1.13 (a), 3.1.13 (b), and 3.2.7 of Schedule 3.1 (the "Fundamental
Representations") shall survive the Closing without time limit; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the Tax Representations shall survive the Closing and continue in full force
and effect until forty-five (45) days following the expiration of the statute
of limitations or prescription applicable to the matters covered thereby; 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.1.32 (Environmental
Matters) of Schedule 3.1 shall survive the Closing and continue in full force
and effect until the date of the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Closing Date; 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1.35 (Employee
Plans) and 3.1.37 (Intellectual Property Rights) of Schedule 3.1 shall survive
the Closing and continue in full force and effect until the date of the second
(2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date; 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

all of the other representations and warranties of the Major Vendors and of
the Corporation in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and continue for a
period ending thirty (30) days after completion of the audited consolidated
financial statements of the Corporation as of and for the period ending
December 31, 2019; provided, however, that such survival period will under no
circumstances extend beyond the date that is eighteen (18) months after the
Closing Date. 

After the expiry of the applicable survival period, the Major Vendors shall
have no further liability hereunder with respect to the applicable
representations and warranties, except with respect to Claims for
indemnification made within such survival period in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, in which case any representation or warranty that is the
subject of such claim shall survive, to the extent of such claim only, until
such claim is resolved, whether or not the amount of Loss resulting from such
claimed breach has been finally determined at the time notice is given. For
the avoidance of doubt, notification of a Claim for indemnification shall be
sufficient to cause any such representation or warranty to continue to survive
for purposes of resolving the Claim at issue. The Indemnified Party shall not
be required to file a lawsuit, begin an arbitration or commence another formal
or informal proceeding in order to cause such representation or warranty to
continue to survive.

of any Breach by a Party of any representation or warranty involving Fraud,
there shall be no time limitation on the right of the other Party to bring any
Claim in respect of such Breach or failure and to be indemnified in respect
thereof. 

| 
---|--- 

3.4.4

|

Covenants. None of the covenants or other agreements contained herein shall
survive the Closing Date other than those which by their terms contemplate
performance in whole or in part after the Closing Date, and each such
surviving covenant and agreement shall survive the Closing for the period
explicitly specified herein (or, if no date or period is specified, then such
covenants and agreements shall survive until fully performed).

a period of at least three (3) years, insurance against all liability for any
Third Party Claims regarding defective products or services manufactured,
sold, provided or performed by or on behalf of any member of the Group on or
prior to the Closing, such insurance to be for at least the same amount and on
the same terms and conditions as the Corporation represented to the Purchaser
were applicable immediately prior to the Closing and with insurers or insurers
with a Standard and Poor's financial strength rating of at least A; provided,
however, that the Purchaser may satisfy the requirements of the foregoing

Closing Date. So long as such Books and Records and such other documents,
information and files are retained by the Purchaser, the Major Vendors or
their authorized representatives shall have reasonable access thereto but the
Purchaser shall not be responsible or liable to the Major Vendors for or as a
result of any loss or destruction of or damage to any such books, or records
or such other documents, information and files. In addition, the Major Vendors
may also retain any copy of the Books and Records which they reasonably deem
to be necessary as prior owners of the Corporation, but in all instances
subject to confidentiality agreements appropriately protective of the
Corporation and Purchaser. Privileged communications and documents related to
the transaction contemplated herein or in any Ancillary Agreement or Closing
Document remain the property of the Major Vendors, are not meant to be
delivered at Closing even if they are inadvertently disclosed when information
systems and records are handed over on Closing.

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

The Corporation, Major Vendors and Purchaser will cooperate fully with each

litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes and will preserve that
data and other information until the expiration of any applicable limitation
period for maintaining books and records under any applicable Tax Law with
respect to the Tax Returns. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Party's

retention agreements entered into with any Tax Authority. 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

Except to the extent required by any applicable Law, as otherwise expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, or with the prior written consent of Vendors'
Delegate (which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or
withheld), the Purchaser covenants that it will not, and it will not cause or
permit the Group to (i) take any action out of the Ordinary Course of Business
on the Closing Date (except as expressly contemplated in this Agreement), (ii)
make any election or deemed election or make or change any Tax election (other
than a Section 338(g) Election contemplated by Section 4.7.5), (iii) amend any
Tax Return or take any position on any Tax Return, in each case that results
in any increased Tax liability or reduction of any deduction, credit or loss
carry-over of any such entity in respect of any period ending on or before or
which includes the Closing Date. In the event that the Purchaser contemplates
any actions, elections or amendments associated with, or related to, any Tax
Returns in the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence, the

before the date at which the Purchaser anticipates to make such actions or
file to such election or amendments and the Purchaser will (i) consider in
good faith any reasonable comments to such actions, elections or amendments
contemplated to be made by the Purchaser or the Group and (ii) make any
reasonable changes to such actions, elections or amendments, in each case,
that are received in writing by the Purchaser no later than ten (10) days
prior to such action or filing date; provided that such changes are not
contrary to applicable Laws and are consistent with the past practices of the
Group. The Purchaser agrees that the Major Vendors are to have no liability
for any Tax (including any related interest and penalties) resulting from any
action referred to in the two preceding sentences in the event that the
Purchaser or Group set aside or disregarded requests, suggestion or comments
made by the Vendors' Delegate as provided above.

(h)

|

Major Vendors and Purchaser agree, upon request, to use reasonable best

4.7.1

|

Pre-Closing Taxes. 

Upon the filing of any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Major
Vendors shall, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, severally (and not
jointly and severally) and promptly pay to Purchaser but in any event within
five (5) days of a written demand thereof, pro rata on the basis of their
Common Equity Designated Percentages, an amount equal to the Taxes, if any,
payable with respect thereto in excess of any such Taxes taken into account as
a Current Liability in the calculation of Closing Working Capital, as finally
determined. Upon the filing of any Tax Return for a Straddle Period (if any),
the Major Vendors shall, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, severally
(and not jointly and severally) and promptly pay to Purchaser but in any event
within fifteen (15) days of a written demand thereof, pro rata on the basis of
their Common Equity Designated Percentages, an amount equal to the portion of
the Taxes, if any, payable with respect thereto in excess of any such Taxes
taken into account in the calculation of the Purchase Price and as a Current
Liability in the calculation of Closing Working Capital, as finally
determined, determined as follows: the amount of any Taxes based on or
measured by income, receipts or payments (including withholding) of the Group
for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (the "Pre-
Closing Straddle Period") shall be determined based on an interim closing of
the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date and as if the
relevant member of the Group had a taxation year ending on the Closing Date,
and the amount of other Taxes that are calculated on a periodic basis (e.g.
real and personal property taxes) of the Group for the Pre-Closing Straddle
Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable
period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in such Straddle Period. In preparing any income Tax
Returns for the Group for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or in computing the
amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of the Group
for the Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period, the Purchaser shall to
the extent allowable under applicable Law claim, deduct or otherwise utilize
any available loss carry forwards, deductions or tax credits generated in the
Pre-Closing Tax Period or otherwise generated in the Pre-Closing Straddle
Period (whether refundable or not) (including, but not limited to, any
Scientific Research and Experimental Development refundable tax credits or
similar investment tax credits).

Without duplication of any other payments or adjustments made pursuant hereto,
upon payment by any Tax Authority to any member of the Group of any Tax refund
and other proceeds paid to any member of the Group in respect of any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or in respect of a Pre-Closing Straddle Period (as
determined in accordance with the principles set out in Section 4.7.20),
including, but not limited to, the payment of any refundable tax credits
(including, but not limited to, any Scientific Research and Experimental
Development refundable tax credits or similar investment tax credits)
associated with or attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Pre-Closing
Straddle Period; the proceeds of such payments in excess of any such Taxes
taken into account in the calculation of the Purchase Price and as a Current
Asset in the calculation of Closing Working Capital, as finally determined,
shall, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, promptly be remitted to the
Vendors' Delegate, on behalf of the Major Vendors, but in any event within
fifteen (15) days of the date of receipt of any such payment. For certainty,
no payment shall be made under this Section 0 in respect of any refund or
credit that has been applied to reduce the amount of Taxes payable by the
Major Vendors in respect of a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Pre-Closing Straddle
Period under Section 0

| 
---|--- 

4.7.2

|

Post-Closing Taxes. The Purchaser and the Group shall be fully responsible for
any Taxes associated with any period after the Closing Date at the complete
exoneration of the Major Vendors, including, but not limited to, any income
Taxes for a Straddle Period to be paid in connection with any period after the
Closing Date as determined in accordance with the principles set out in
Section 0. 

| 
---|--- 

4.7.3

|

Tax Assessments or Claims associated with any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period. Upon any Tax Authority issuing a Tax assessment or a draft
Tax assessment with respect to any member of the Group or making a Claim in
respect of Taxes of any member of the Group associated with or in respect of
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period for which the Major Vendors
are liable to indemnify Purchaser pursuant to the provisions of Article 6, or
threatening orally or in writing to make any such Claim (a "Tax Claim"), the
Purchaser shall promptly notify the Vendors' Delegate in writing of the
foregoing together with all details in connection with same and the copy of
all relevant Tax assessments, draft Tax assessments, proceedings, letters or
correspondence with the applicable Tax Authority, as applicable, and in any
event, within thirty (30) days that the Purchaser or the Corporation receives
notice of any such Tax Claim. The Vendors' Delegate may participate (at Major
Vendors' own expense) in the defence of any Tax Claim by giving written notice
to that effect to the Purchaser not later than ten (10) days after receiving
notice of that Tax Claim. The Purchaser shall not settle any Tax Claim that
could give rise to a claim for indemnification under Article 6 without the
written consent of the Vendors' Delegate (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the extent, and for so long as, the
Vendors' Delegate participates in the defence of a Tax Claim. 

|

4.7.4

|

Certain U.S. Tax Elections. At the sole election of Purchaser, Purchaser may
make or cause to be made an election under Section 338(g) of the Code (and any

the Tax Act, upon request by the Purchaser, the Major Vendors shall concur
with an election under subsection 185.1(2) of the Tax Act (and the equivalent

the Major Vendors shall concur with an election under subsection 184(3) of the
Tax Act and the equivalent provisions of any applicable provincial tax statute
to treat such dividend as two distinct dividends, namely: (i) a "capital
dividend" equal to the balance of the capital dividend account of such member
of the Group immediately before such dividend became payable, and (ii) a
"taxable dividend" for any excess. The Major Vendors shall execute and
deliver, make or cause to be made all such further acts, deeds, assurances and

In the case of (1) Breaches of Fundamental Representations, (2) Breaches of
Tax Representations, or (3) Fraud, if Losses related to Claims for
indemnification made by any Purchaser Indemnitee against the Major Vendors
pursuant to Section 6.1 exceed the sum of the Threshold and the First Source
Amount and, if applicable and to the extent covered, the amount of the limit
of liability of the RandW Insurance Provider under the RandW Insurance Policy, any
Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification from the Major
Vendors for the amount of the unsatisfied portion of the Losses which are in
excess of the aggregate of such amounts subject to the Caps. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

In the case of Losses resulting from or otherwise associated with the
indemnification obligations under Section 6.1.2(c) ("Qualified Losses"): 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

if such Qualified Losses result from (1) a Breach of a Tax Representation, or
(2) is otherwise covered by the RandW Insurance Policy (a "Covered Tax
Liability"), Purchaser Indemnitees shall pursue indemnification as follows: 

| 
---|--- 

(I)

|

First, the Major Vendors shall be responsible for such portion of such
Qualified Losses for an amount up to the Threshold; 

| 
---|--- 

(II)

|

Second, if the amount of such Qualified Losses exceeds the Threshold, then (x)
provided such Qualified Loss is a Covered Tax Liability, then the Purchaser
Indemnitees shall seek indemnification for such excess amount against the
General Indemnity Holdback and (y) otherwise, the Major Vendors shall be
responsible for such excess up to the "Retention" as this term is defined in
the RandW Insurance Policy; 

| 
---|--- 

(III)

|

Third, in the event that the sum of the amount set out in subsection I and the
amount actually disbursed under subsection II in connection with such
Qualified Losses is lower than the "Retention" as this term is defined in the
RandW Insurance Policy, the Major Vendors shall be responsible for such
shortfall subject to the Purchase Price Cap; 

| 
---|--- 

(IV)

|

Fourth, 

| 
---|--- 

a.

|

Purchaser Indemnitees shall then actively pursue coverage and payment under
the RandW Insurance Policy for the actual amount of such Qualified Losses, up to
the policy limit of the RandW Insurance Policy and, in order to do so, shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain payment and compensation under the
RandW Insurance Policy; provided however, it being understood and agreed that
the actions to be undertaken by Purchaser Indemnitees under this subsection
(IV)(a) shall consist solely of filing an insurance claim and reasonable
follow up discussions and correspondence with the RandW Insurance Provider, but
shall specifically not include or be deemed to require the filing of any
lawsuit or otherwise instituting any legal proceedings (whether arbitrational,
judicial or otherwise); 

| 
---|--- 

b.

|

in the event that coverage is denied by the RandW Insurance Provider
notwithstanding the efforts of Purchaser Indemnitees referred to in subsection
(IV)(a) above, the Major Vendors shall be responsible for any such Qualified
Losses which exceed the sum of the amounts set out in subsections (I) through
(III) above, subject to the Purchase Price Cap; 

| 
---|--- 

c.

|

in the event that RandW Insurance Provider honours the RandW Insurance Policy and
makes payments under the RandW Insurance Policy, such payments from the RandW
Insurance Provider shall be the fourth source of indemnification of the
Purchaser Indemnitees hereunder; 

| 
---|--- 

(V)

|

Fifth, in the event that coverage is provided by the RandW Insurance Provider
and that such Qualified Losses exceed the sum of the amounts set out in
subsections (I) through (III) above together with the payments made under
subsection (IV)(c) above, the Major Vendors shall be responsible for any
excess amount, subject to the Purchase Price Cap; 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

with respect to Qualified Losses which are not a Covered Tax Liability, any
Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification from the Major
Vendors from dollar one up to the Purchase Price Cap; 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

notwithstanding any provisions hereof, no Major Vendor shall support, or
indemnify any Purchaser Indemnitees with respect to any reduction in value or
consequential, indirect, special or punitive losses (but not for the remainder
of such Losses) on any income taxes that are included in any such Qualified
Losses or any liability identified in Schedule 6.1.2(d). 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

The maximum aggregate liability of a Major Vendor associated with (i) Breaches
of Sections 6.1.1(b) or 6.1.2(b), (ii) Liabilities associated with the
indemnification obligations under Section 6.1.2(c) or (iii) Liabilities
identified in Schedule 6.1.2(d), shall not exceed its Common Equity Designated
Percentage of the Purchase Price Cap (after deducting the Preferred Equity
Purchase Price), and, in the case of a Preferred Shareholder, such amount
plus, the Preferred Equity Purchase Price. 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

In the event that Losses related to any Claim for indemnification made by any
Purchaser Indemnitee against the Major Vendors pursuant to Section 6.1.2(d)
exceed the amount of Special Indemnity Holdback corresponding to any matter
set forth on Schedule 6.1.2(d) (i.e., such amount has been distributed or
otherwise is being held for pending claims by a Purchaser Indemnitee), then
the General Indemnity Holdback shall be the second source of satisfaction of
any unsatisfied Loss in excess of the applicable Special Indemnity Holdback
(only to the extent that such unsatisfied Loss exceeds the Threshold, together
with all other Losses that have been applied to the Threshold, collectively
exceed the Threshold, but not subject to any Mini-Basket). 

| 
---|--- 

(h)

|

In the event that any Purchaser Indemnitee seeks recourse to the Escrow Amount
for matters that a Major Vendor is severally (and not jointly and severally)
liable for, the full amount of funds remaining in the Escrow Amount shall be
available to the Purchaser Indemnitee for recourse (and the Purchaser
Indemnitee's recourse shall not be limited to such Major Vendor's Common
Equity Designated Percentage of the Escrow Amount). 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

No Party hereto shall be obligated to indemnify any other Person with respect
to any Losses with respect to any matter if such matter was included in the
calculation of the adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

| 
---|--- 

6.3.2

Losses which exceed the Threshold may be recovered by the Major Vendors,
subject to the limitations hereof. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

The maximum aggregate liability of the Purchaser and Parent with respect to
indemnification by the Purchaser or Parent pursuant to Section 6.2 shall not

with respect to any such Breach of representation or warranty or Breach of
covenant or agreement, any qualification or limitation based on materiality

agreement, and the amount of any Losses with respect to any such Breach of
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall be determined as if

thereof and an opportunity to contest such Third Party Claim.

other special damages. 

|

|

Tax Benefits. The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided

actually realized in the year of the Loss or the following taxable year by the
Indemnified Party (and, if the Indemnified Party is the Purchaser, the
Corporation) arising from the occurrence or payment of that Loss, to the
extent necessary to ensure that the Indemnified Party receives a net amount
which, taking into account any such net Tax benefit, is sufficient to fully
compensate for the Loss, but results in no net gain to the Indemnified Party,
such amount of net Tax benefit to be determined by the Indemnified Party in
its sole discretion, which shall be final and conclusive if made in good
faith. 

| 
---|--- 

6.4.6

| 
---|--- 

6.4.7

|

Recovery Once. With respect to any Loss suffered by the Indemnified Party, no
liability shall attach to the Indemnifier to the extent that the same Loss has
been recovered by the Indemnified Party under any other representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement or any other document referred to herein
and, accordingly, the Indemnified Party may only recover once in respect of
the same Loss. 

| 
---|---

the time period so required (but in no event to exceed 30 days). 

| 
---|--- 

6.4.12

| 
---|--- 

6.5

|

Direct Claims 

Any Direct Claim shall be asserted by giving the Indemnifier reasonably prompt
written notice thereof, but in any event not later than twenty (20) days after
the Indemnified Party becomes aware of acts, omissions or facts that may give
rise to such Direct Claim (or such shorter period as may be necessary to give
the Indemnifier reasonable time to timely respond in any applicable
proceeding, in the event of a litigated matter). Such notice to the
Indemnifier shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail and shall
indicate, if reasonably practicable, the estimated amount of the Loss that has
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifier shall then
have a period of thirty (30) days within which to respond in writing to such
Direct Claim (the "Response Period"). If the Indemnifier does not so respond
within the Response Period, the Indemnifier shall be deemed to have rejected
such Claim, and in such event the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue
such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party (including those
provided for in the Escrow Agreement, if applicable). If the Indemnifier
agrees prior to the expiration of the Response Period as to the validity of
the Direct Claim (or of any portion thereof), the Indemnifier shall promptly
pay, or the Parties shall direct the Escrow Agent to pay, to the extent
applicable, to the Indemnified Party the amount of such Direct Claim (or
portion thereof as to which the Indemnifier agreed was valid) forthwith upon
such amount being quantified. If the Parties fail to agree as to the validity
of all or any portion of the Direct Claim or its amount, any Party may
exercise all remedies as may be available to such Party with respect to all or
such portion of the Direct Claim as to which there is disagreement, as
applicable. If the Indemnified Party is a Purchaser Indemnitee, such Purchaser
Indemnitee shall be authorized to notify the Escrow Agent and the RandW
Insurance Provider of the Direct Claim (or portion thereof as to which there
is disagreement). To the extent the applicable Claim seeks payment from the
Indemnity Holdback, the payment of the applicable Loss (or portion thereof)
shall also proceed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Escrow
Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

6.6

|

Notice of Third Party Claims 

If an Indemnified Party receives notice of the commencement or assertion of
any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifier
reasonably prompt notice thereof, but in any event no later than twenty (20)
days after receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim (or such shorter
period as may be necessary to give the Indemnifier reasonable time to timely
respond in any applicable proceeding, in the event of a litigated matter).
Such notice to the Indemnifier shall describe the Third Party Claim in
reasonable detail and shall indicate, if reasonably practicable, the estimated
amount of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party.
If the Indemnified Party is a Purchaser Indemnitee, such Purchaser Indemnitee
shall be authorized to notify the Escrow Agent and the RandW Insurance Provider
of the Third Party Claim. To the extent the applicable Claim seeks payment
from the Indemnity Holdback, the payment of the applicable Loss (or portion
thereof) shall also proceed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Escrow Agreement.

6.7

|

Defence of Third Party Claims 

| 
---|--- 

6.7.1

|

Assumption of Defence. The Indemnifier may participate in or assume the
defence of any Third Party Claim by giving notice to that effect to the
Indemnified Party not later than thirty (30) days after receiving notice of
that Third Party Claim (the "Notice Period"), but only if (i) it acknowledges
in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party against any and
all Losses that may result from such Third-Party Claim in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and (ii) such Third-Party Claim is exclusively for
civil monetary damages at law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifier
shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim for
equitable or injunctive relief or any claim that would impose criminal
liability or damages, and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
defend, at the expense of the Indemnifier, any such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnifier's right to so participate in or assume the defence of such Third
Party Claim, shall be subject to the rights of any insurer or other party who
has potential liability in respect of that Third Party Claim. The Indemnifier
agrees to pay all of its own expenses of participating in or assuming such
defence. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in the defence of
each Third Party Claim, even if the defence has been assumed by the
Indemnifier, and may participate in such defence assisted by counsel of its
own choice at its cost and expense, provided that, subject to the satisfaction
of (i) and (ii) above, the Indemnifier and its legal counsel shall lead the
defence unless the interests of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifier
cannot, in the view of counsel for the Indemnified Party, be properly
represented by the same counsel, then the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to have its own counsel defend it and the expenses of such separate
counsel for the Indemnified Party shall be borne by the Indemnifier. If the
Indemnified Party has not received the notice within the Notice Period that
the Indemnifier has elected to assume the defence of such Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party may, at its option, elect to settle or compromise the
Third Party Claim or assume such defence, assisted by counsel of its own
choosing and the Indemnifier shall be liable for all reasonable costs and
expenses paid or incurred in connection therewith and any Loss suffered or
incurred by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

6.7.2

|

Settlement. The Indemnifier shall not settle, compromise or offer to settle or
compromise any Third Party Claim without the written consent of the
Indemnified Party, unless: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

the terms of the compromise and settlement require only the payment of money
and do not require the Indemnified Party to admit any wrongdoing or take or
refrain from taking any action; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the Indemnified Party receives, as part of the compromise and settlement, an
unconditional release, which is in form and substance satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, acting reasonably, from any and all obligations or
liabilities it may have with respect to the Third Party Claim; and 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

such settlement is on a basis that would not result in (i) the imposition of a
consent order, injunction or decree that would restrict the future activity or
conduct of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (ii) a finding or
admission of a violation of Law, wrongdoing or violation of the rights of any
Person by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or (iii) equitable
remedies or any obligation of the Indemnified Party other than the payment of
money damages for which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified hereunder. 

| 
---|--- 

6.8

|

Assistance for Third Party Claims 

The Indemnifier and the Indemnified Party shall use all reasonable efforts to
make available to the Party which is undertaking and controlling the defence
of any Third Party Claim (the "Defending Party"):

| 
---|--- 

6.8.1

|

those employees whose assistance, testimony or presence is necessary to assist
the Defending Party in evaluating and in defending any Third Party Claim; and 

| 
---|--- 

6.8.2

|

all documents, records and other materials in the possession of such Party
reasonably required by the Defending Party for its use in defending any Third
Party Claim. 

Each of them shall otherwise cooperate with the Defending Party. The
Indemnifier shall be responsible for all expenses associated with making such
documents, records and materials available.

| 
---|--- 

6.9

|

Duty to Mitigate 

Nothing in this Agreement shall in any way restrict or limit the general
obligation at law of an Indemnified Party to mitigate any Loss which it may
suffer or incur by reason of the Breach by an Indemnifier of any
representation or warranty or the Breach of any covenant of the Indemnifier
hereunder. If any Loss can be reduced by any recovery, settlement or otherwise
under or pursuant to any insurance coverage, or pursuant to any Claim against,
recovery from, settlement with or payment by any other Person, the Indemnified
Party shall use its reasonable good faith efforts to take the appropriate
steps to attempt to enforce such Claim, recovery, settlement or payment.

| 
---|--- 

6.10

|

Exclusivity of Remedy 

Except for claims for Fraud and as provided in this Section 6.10, the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Indemnitees and the Major Vendors (in law,
under applicable law or otherwise) for any Breach by the other of its
representations, warranties or covenants in this Agreement or arising from the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be a claim for indemnification pursuant
to this Article 6\. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the limitations and
restrictions (including time for asserting Claims) on indemnification set
forth in this Article 6 shall affect the rights of the Purchaser Indemnitees
to make Claims against the RandW Insurance Provider under the RandW Insurance
Policy, which rights shall be governed solely by the terms and conditions of
the RandW Insurance Policy.

| 
---|--- 

6.11

|

Purchase Price Adjustment 

Any indemnification payment made under this Article 6 shall be treated by the
Purchaser and the Major Vendors as an adjustment to the Aggregate Purchase
Price. Such adjustment shall be allocated to the holders of the Class A and
the Class B shares of the Corporation, pro rata in accordance with their
interests.

Guarantee

Scope of Guarantee. The Parent hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees to the Major Vendors, jointly and severally with the Purchaser, the
prompt and full performance and payment of all obligations of the Purchaser
under this Agreement (the "Purchaser Obligations"). The guarantee under this
Article 7 may be enforced by the Major Vendors without the necessity at any
time of resorting to or exhausting any other remedy or without the necessity
at any time of having recourse to this Agreement. The Parent agrees that
nothing contained herein shall prevent the Major Vendors from exercising any
and all rights or remedies under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or
Closing Document if any of the Purchaser or the Parent fail to timely perform
the Purchaser Obligations, and the exercise of any of the aforesaid rights and
the completion of any actions or proceedings related thereto shall not
constitute a discharge of any of the obligations of the Parent hereunder, it
being the express purpose and intent of the Parent that the Parent's
obligations hereunder shall be absolute, independent and unconditional under
any and all circumstances. 

| 
---|--- 

7.1.2

|

Survival of Guarantee. The obligation of the Parent to perform the Purchaser
Obligations will not be limited or reduced as a result of the termination,
invalidity or unenforceability of any right of the Major Vendors against the
Purchaser due to any incapacity, disability or lack or limitation of status or
of the power of the Purchaser or as a result of bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar proceeding involving the Purchaser or for any other circumstance or
reason whatsoever (other than the fulfillment of the Purchaser Obligations). 

| 
---|--- 

7.1.3

|

Reinstatement. The terms of this Article 7 shall continue to be effective, or
be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment (in whole or in
part) of any of the Purchaser Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be
returned or restored by the Major Vendors by reason of bankruptcy, insolvency
or reorganization of the Purchaser, all as though such obligation had not been
fulfilled. 

| 
---|--- 

7.1.4

|

Costs and Expenses. If at any time hereafter the Major Vendors retain counsel
to pursue collection, to sue for enforcement of the terms hereof, or to file a
Claim in any suit or proceeding related to the guarantee set forth in this
Article 7, then each such event where the Major Vendors prevail, all of the
reasonable legal fees, including extra-judicial fees and costs, related
thereto shall be an additional liability of the Parent to the Major Vendors,
payable on demand.

Affiliates or Representatives shall disclose to any third party this
Agreement, the subject matter or terms hereof, or any Confidential Information
concerning the business or affairs of any other Party which it may have

investors, financing sources, accountants, consultants and others (so long as
in each case in the foregoing clauses (ii), (iii) or (v), such disclosure has
a valid business purpose, is consistent with prior practice of Novacap, the
recipients are bound by customary confidentiality provisions, and Novacap is
responsible for any and all breaches of any such Person(s)).

All public notices to third parties and all other announcements,
communications, press releases and publicity concerning the Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement, if prior to the Closing, must be

8.12

|

Post-Acquisition Attorney-Client Issues 

| 
---|--- 

8.12.1

|

Vendors Post-Acquisition Use of Law Firms. Each of the Parties acknowledges
that (i) one or more Vendors and the Group have retained the Law Firms to act
as their counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as well as other past and ongoing matters; (ii) except for the
Vendors and the Group, the Law Firms have not acted as counsel for any other
Person in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and
(iii) no Person other than the Vendors and the Group has the status of client
of the Law Firms for conflict of interest or any other purpose as a result
thereof. The Purchaser (x) waives and will not assert, and will cause each of
its Affiliates to waive and not assert, any conflict of interest relating to
the Law Firms' representation after the Closing of any Vendor, member of the
Group or their respective Affiliates in any matter involving the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and (y) consents to, and will cause each of
its Affiliates to consent to, any such representation, even though, in each
case, (A) the interests of such Vendor, and or such Vendor's Affiliate may be
directly adverse to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates; or (B) the Law
Firms may have represented the Group or any of their Affiliates in a
substantially related matter. 

| 
---|--- 

8.12.2

|

Purchaser's Non-Access to the Group's Legal Records Regarding the Transaction.
The Purchaser agrees that, after the Closing, neither the Purchaser nor any of
its Affiliates will have any right to access or control any of the Law Firms'
records relating to or affecting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, which will be the property of (and controlled by) the Vendors. In
addition, all communications between the Vendors and Group, on the one hand,
and the Law Firms, on the other hand, related to this or any other proposed
sale of the Purchased Shares, the Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to
the Vendors and their respective Affiliates (and not the Group) (the "Vendors
Pre-Closing Communications"). Accordingly, neither the members of the Group
nor the Purchaser shall have access to any such Vendors Pre-Closing
Communications or to the files of the Law Firms relating to such engagement
from and after the Closing, and all books, records and other materials of the
Group in any medium (including electronic copies) containing or reflecting any
of the Vendors Pre-Closing Communications or the work product of legal counsel
with respect thereto, including any related summaries, drafts or analyses, and
all rights with respect to any of the foregoing, are hereby retained by,
assigned and transferred to the Vendors effective as of the Closing. Such
material and information shall be excluded from the transfer contemplated by
this Agreement and shall be delivered to the Vendors immediately prior to the
Closing with no copies thereof retained by the members of the Group, the
Purchaser or any of the Purchaser's Affiliates or Representatives. From and
after the Closing, the Purchaser and the members of the Group shall maintain
the confidentiality of all such material and information. From and after the
Closing, none of the Purchaser, the members of the Group, Affiliates and
Representatives shall access or in any way, directly or indirectly, use or
rely upon any such materials or information. To the extent that any such
materials or information are not delivered to the Vendors prior to the
Closing, they will be held for the benefit of the Vendors, and the Purchaser,
the members of the Group and their respective Affiliates will deliver all such
material and information to the Vendors promptly upon discovery thereof,
without using or retaining copies thereof. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, from and after the Closing, (a) the Vendors and their
respective Affiliates (and not the members of the Group) shall be the sole
holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement and
the Vendors Pre-Closing Communications, and none of the members of the Group
shall be a holder thereof, (b) to the extent that files of Vendors' Counsel in
respect of such engagement and with respect to the Vendors Pre-Closing
Communications constitute property of the client, only the Vendors and their
respective Affiliates (and not the members of the Group) shall hold such
property rights and (c) Vendors' Counsel shall not have any duty whatsoever to
reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications, files or the
Vendors Pre-Closing Communications to the members of the Group by reason of
any attorney-client relationship between Vendors' Counsel and the members of
the Group or otherwise. As to Vendors Pre-Closing Communications, the
Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the members of the
Group) and the Vendors, together with any of their respective Affiliates,
successors or assigns, agree that no such party may use or rely on any of the
Vendors Pre-Closing Communications in any action or claim against or involving
any of the Parties hereto after the Closing. 

| 
---|--- 

8.12.3

|

Vendors' Retention of Attorney-Client Privilege with respect to Sell-Side
Legal Representation. The Purchaser agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of
its Affiliates, that from and after the Closing, (i) the attorney-client
privilege, all other evidentiary privileges, and the expectation of client
confidence as to all Vendors Pre-Closing Communications belong to the Vendors
and will not pass to or be claimed by the Purchaser, the members of the Group
or any of their respective Affiliates; and (ii) the Vendors will have the
exclusive right to control, assert, or waive attorney-client privilege, any
other evidentiary privilege, and the expectation of client confidence with
respect to such Vendors Pre-Closing Communications. Accordingly, the Purchaser
will not, and will cause each of its Affiliates not to, (x) assert any
attorney-client privilege, other evidentiary privilege, or expectation of
client confidence with respect to any Vendors Pre-Closing Communications,
except in the event of a post-Closing dispute with a Person that is not a
Vendor or one of their respective Affiliates; or (y) take any action that
could cause any Vendors Pre-Closing Communications to cease being a
confidential communication or to otherwise lose protection under the attorney-
client privilege or any other evidentiary privilege including waiving such
protection in any dispute with a Person that is not a Vendor or one of their
respective Affiliates. Furthermore, each of the Purchaser and the Vendors
agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of each of its Affiliates, that in the
event of a dispute between any Vendor or one of their respective Affiliates,
on the one hand, and any member of the Group, on the other hand, arising out
of or relating to any matter in which the Law Firms jointly represented both
parties, neither the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client
confidence, nor any right to any other evidentiary privilege will protect from
disclosure to such members of the Group or Affiliate thereof, any information
or documents developed or shared during the course of the Law Firms' joint
representation.
