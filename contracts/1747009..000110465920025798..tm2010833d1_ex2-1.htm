of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that (a) either party has an
adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity (it
being understood that nothing in this sentence shall prohibit the parties hereto from raising other defenses to a claim for specific
