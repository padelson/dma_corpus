THE MERGER

  

  

Section 2.01 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or
written waiver (where permissible under applicable Law) of the conditions set
forth in Article VIII, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Spinco.
As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease and Spinco shall continue as the surviving corporation of the
Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

  

  

Section 2.02 Closing; Effective Time. As promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than the third (3rd) Business Day (unless another date is agreed
to in writing by TDCC and Parent), after the satisfaction or written waiver
(where permissible under applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in
Article VIII (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or written waiver
(where permissible under applicable Law) of those conditions at the Closing),
the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, in such form as is required by, and executed
in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of
such filing of the Certificate of Merger (or such later time as may be agreed
by each of the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger)
being the "Effective Time"). Immediately prior to such filing of the
Certificate of Merger, a closing (the "Closing") shall be held at the offices
of Shearman and Sterling LLP, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022, or
such other place as the parties shall agree, for the purpose of confirming the
satisfaction or waiver, as the case may be, of the conditions set forth in
Article VIII.

  

  

Section 2.03 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

  

  

Section 2.04 Conversion of Securities. (a) Conversion of Spinco Common Stock.
At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, Spinco or the holders of the Spinco Common Stock,
each share of Spinco Common Stock (all shares of Spinco Common Stock being
collectively, the "Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Shares to be cancelled or converted pursuant to
Section 2.04(b)) shall be converted automatically into the right to receive a
number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the Exchange Ratio, subject to adjustment in accordance with Sections 2.04(d)
and 3.01(f) (the "Merger Consideration"), and each holder of certificates or
book-entry shares which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
such Shares shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect thereto
except (i) the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or
other distributions pursuant to Section 3.01(c) and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 3.01(e), in each case to be
issued or paid, without interest, in consideration therefor; and (ii) as
provided by Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(b) Cancellation of Certain Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Spinco or the
holders of the Spinco Common Stock, each Share held in the treasury of Spinco
shall automatically be cancelled without any conversion thereof and no payment
or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

  

  

(c) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Spinco or the
holders of the Spinco Common Stock, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(d) Exchange Ratio True-Up. If the condition set forth in Section 8.03(b)
would be unable to be satisfied because immediately after the Effective Time,
the percentage of outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by
the former holders of Spinco Common Stock with respect to Qualified Spinco
Common Stock would be less than 50.5% (the "Threshold Percentage") of all the
stock of Parent (including (i) any instruments that are treated as stock for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes; and (ii) any stock that may be issued after
the Effective Time, pursuant to the exercise or settlement of an option or
other contract acquired or entered into on or before the Effective Time that
may be regarded as having been acquired or entered into before the Effective
Time as part of a "plan" of which the Distribution is a part within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code, but excluding (A) for purposes of
clause (i), any employee stock option that, at the time of grant, was not in-
the-money and, unless an election has been made under Section 83(b) of the
Code with respect thereto, any stock or stock rights granted as compensation
before the Effective Time that is not vested at the Effective Time; and (B)
for purposes of clause (ii), any stock that may be issued after the Effective
Time, pursuant to the exercise or settlement of any rights pursuant to a
Parent Stock Plan), determined without regard to any adjustment pursuant to
this Section 2.04(d)), then the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common
Stock into which the shares of Spinco Common Stock are converted pursuant to
Section 2.04(a) shall be increased such that the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock to be received by the former holders of Spinco Common Stock with
respect to Qualified Spinco Common Stock equals the Threshold Percentage. If
any such increase is required solely by reason of any actions taken by TDCC or
its Affiliates pursuant to the plan (or series of related transactions) which
includes the Distribution (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code)
or failure by TDCC or its Affiliates to take any commercially reasonable
action to prevent such increase, then the Above Basis Amount shall be
decreased by an amount equal to the product of $29.00 multiplied by the number
of additional shares of Parent Common Stock required to be issued pursuant to
the true-up set forth in this Section 2.04(d) solely by reason of such actions
taken by TDCC or its Affiliates.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 2.05 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws. (a) The certificate of
incorporation of Spinco shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Spinco or the holders of the Spinco Common
Stock, be amended and restated in its entirety to read as set forth in Annex A
and, as so amended and restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter duly amended in accordance with
such certificate of incorporation, this Agreement and applicable Law.

  

  

(b) The bylaws of Spinco shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Spinco or the holders of the Spinco Common
Stock, be amended and restated in their entirety to read as set forth in Annex
B and, as so amended and restated, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter duly amended in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, such bylaws, this Agreement and
applicable Law.

  

  

Section 2.06 Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of
Spinco immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers
of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified or until such officer's earlier death,
resignation or removal.

  

  

Section 2.07 Board of Directors of Parent. The Parent Board shall take all
such action as may be necessary (a) to cause the number of directors
comprising the Parent Board as of the Effective Time to be increased by three
(3) directors to twelve (12) directors; and (b) to cause three (3) individuals
designated by TDCC to be appointed to the Parent Board as of the Effective
Time to serve until the next annual election of directors of Parent; provided,
that if any of such TDCC designees is unable or unwilling to serve, then TDCC
shall select a reasonable replacement for such TDCC designee. In connection
with the next annual election of directors of Parent, the Parent Board shall
take all such action as may be necessary to include each of the TDCC designees
as nominees for the Parent Board recommended by the Parent Board for election
by Parent's stockholders.

  

  

Section 2.08 Transaction Structure. If, prior to the date on which Parent
commences solicitation of proxies for use at the Parent Stockholders' Meeting,
the IRS notifies TDCC that the IRS will not issue one or more of the requested
rulings, then, during the sixty (60) day period starting from the date of such
IRS notification, the parties hereto shall collaborate reasonably and in good
faith in order to determine a possible alternative structure for the
transactions contemplated hereby that the parties hereto determine, with the
assistance of their respective tax advisors, will either make likely the
receipt from the IRS of the ruling at issue or eliminate the necessity for the
rulings, in either case, without (a) increasing in any material respect the
costs to any party hereto or any of their respective Affiliates; (b) causing
the performance of the covenants and agreements of any party hereto to become
more burdensome in any material respect; (c) expanding in any material respect
the scope of consents and approvals required to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby; (d) decreasing in any material respect the expected
benefits of the transactions contemplated hereby to any party hereto or any of
their respective Affiliates; or (e) otherwise resulting in any substantial
impediment to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. In the
event the parties hereto reasonably, and in good faith, agree upon such an
alternative transaction structure, they shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, modify the covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents accordingly to reflect the change in
transaction structure referenced in the immediately preceding sentence. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each of the parties hereto shall take all action
reasonably necessary to modify the ruling request to reflect the transactions
as so modified and effectuate the change in transaction structure contemplated
by this Section 2.08, and each party hereto shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the transactions contemplated hereby, as so modified, to be
consummated as soon as practicable thereafter and in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 2.09 Ethylene Payment. At the Closing, Parent shall cause the payments
to be made that are required to be made on the Closing Date pursuant to the
Ethylene Sales Contract (North America) to be entered into pursuant to Section
6.10 of the Separation Agreement, a term sheet of which is attached as Exhibit
II to the Separation Agreement.

  

  

ARTICLE III

  

  

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

  

  

Section 3.01 Exchange Fund. (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time,
TDCC shall designate a nationally-recognized commercial bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to Parent to act as agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the
benefit of the holders of Shares who exchange their Shares in accordance with
this Article III. Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, for exchange in
accordance with this Article III promptly after the Effective Time, book-entry
shares representing the Merger Consideration issuable to holders of Shares as
of the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.04(a) (such book-entry shares for
shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto pursuant to Section 3.01(c) and other amounts payable in
accordance with Section 3.01(e), the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions from Parent, deliver the Merger
Consideration out of the Exchange Fund. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund
shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent. Any interest or
other income from such investments shall be paid to and become income of
Parent. Except as contemplated by Section 3.01(g), the Exchange Fund shall not
be used for any purpose other than as specified in this Section 3.01(a).

  

  

(b) Exchange Procedures.

  

  

(i) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to distribute the shares of Parent Common Stock into which
the shares of Spinco Common Stock that were distributed in the Distribution
have been converted pursuant to the Merger, which shares shall be distributed
on the same basis as the shares of Spinco Common Stock were distributed in the
Distribution and to the Persons who received Spinco Common Stock in the
Distribution. Each Person entitled to receive Spinco Common Stock in the
Distribution shall be entitled to receive in respect of the shares of Spinco
Common Stock distributed to such Person a book-entry authorization
representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Section 3.01(b) (and cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, as contemplated by Section
3.01(e)) (and any dividends or distributions and other amounts pursuant to
Section 3.01(c)). The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise
any rights of ownership with respect to Parent Common Stock held by it from
time to time hereunder, except as contemplated by Section 3.01(c).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of TDCC Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of Spinco, cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 3.01(e) and any dividends or other distributions such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(c) may be issued to a transferee
who should have received Shares if the certificate or book-entry shares
representing such TDCC Common Stock are presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Upon
exchange as contemplated by this Section 3.01, each Share shall be deemed at
all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender, without interest, the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of
any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that the holder of such Share is
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(e) and any dividends or other
distributions such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(c).

  

  

(c) Distributions with Respect to Undistributed Shares of Parent Common Stock.
No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with
respect to Parent Common Stock shall be paid with respect to any shares of
Parent Common Stock that are not able to be distributed by the Exchange Agent
promptly after the Effective Time, whether due to a legal impediment to such
distribution or otherwise. Subject to the effect of abandoned property,
escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws, following the distribution of any such
previously undistributed shares of Parent Common Stock, there shall be paid to
the record holder of such shares of Parent Common Stock, without interest, (i)
at the time of the distribution, the amount of cash payable in lieu of a
fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.01(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock; and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to the distribution of such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock and a payment date subsequent to the distribution of such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

  

  

(d) No Further Rights in Spinco Common Stock. All shares of Parent Common
Stock issued upon the exchange of Spinco Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of this Article III (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 3.01(c)
or Section 3.01(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued or paid, as the case
may be, in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Spinco
Common Stock.

  

  

(e) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Spinco Common Stock, and such fractional
share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote, or to any other
rights of a stockholder of Parent. All fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock that a holder of shares of Spinco Common Stock would otherwise be
entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated by the
Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall cause the whole shares obtained
thereby to be sold on behalf of such holders of shares of Spinco Common Stock
that would otherwise be entitled to receive such fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock in the Merger, in the open market or otherwise, in each case at
then-prevailing market prices, and in no case later than five (5) Business
Days after the time of the Distribution. The Exchange Agent shall make
available the net proceeds thereof, subject to the deduction of the amount of
any withholding Taxes as contemplated in Section 3.01(i) and brokerage
charges, commissions and Conveyance Taxes, on a pro rata basis, without
interest, as soon as practicable to the holders of Spinco Common Stock that
would otherwise be entitled to receive such fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock in the Merger.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to
reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Parent Common Stock or Spinco Common Stock), extraordinary
cash dividends, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Parent
Common Stock or Spinco Common Stock with a record date occurring on or after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, other than the issuance of
stock by Spinco in the Separation, the Special Payment, or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Separation Agreement;
provided that nothing in this Section 3.01(f) shall be construed to permit
Spinco, Parent or Merger Sub to take any action with respect to its securities
that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

  

  

(g) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
proceeds of any investment thereof) that remains undistributed to the former
holders of Shares on the date that is nine (9) months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any former holders of Shares
who have not theretofore received shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance
with this Article III shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger
Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.04(a), any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled
pursuant to Section 3.01(e) and any dividends or other distributions with
respect to the Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to
Section 3.01(c) (subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law).

  

  

(h) No Liability. None of the Parent, TDCC, Spinco, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person for any Merger
Consideration from the Exchange Fund (or dividends or distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock) or other cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(i) Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent,
Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amount as it is

any notes thereto) contained (or incorporated by reference) in the Parent SEC
Documents (i) present fairly, in all material respects, the combined financial
position of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the

(b) Parent has delivered to TDCC true, complete and fully executed copies of
(i) an executed bridge commitment letter and (ii) an executed commitment
letter (in each case, including (A) all exhibits, schedules, annexes and

(B) any associated fee letter in redacted form, which redacted fee information
does not relate to the amounts or conditionality of, or contain any conditions
precedent to, the funding of the Financing (as defined below)) (together, the
"Spinco Commitment Letter") from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
(together with all additional lenders and financing sources added to the
Spinco Commitment Letter or any Alternative Spinco Commitment Letter, the
"Lenders"), pursuant to which, among other things, the Lenders have committed
to Parent to provide Spinco and Parent with debt financing in an aggregate
amount of $3,769,500,000 (the bank and/or bond financings, together with the

Letter, being referred to as the "Financing"). Prior to the date of this
Agreement, (x) the Spinco Commitment Letter has not been amended, waived or
modified; and (y) the respective commitments contained in the Spinco
Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any
respect. Except for the Spinco Commitment Letter, there are no side letters or

(c) The Spinco Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is in full force
and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the
knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto. As of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred and on the Closing Date, no event shall have
occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent under any term or
condition of the Spinco Commitment Letter. Parent has fully paid any and all
commitment fees, any other fees or any other amounts required by the Spinco
Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement and
Parent represents that any other fees or other amounts that are due under the
Spinco Commitment Letter or any related fee letters are, in each case,
required to be paid no earlier than the Closing. The Financing will provide
financing sufficient to finance the New Debt and the Additional Debt and to
pay all related fees and expenses associated therewith. Other than as set
forth in the Spinco Commitment Letter, there are no conditions precedent to
the funding of the full amount of the Financing. Parent has no reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied on a
timely basis or that the Financing will not be available to Spinco immediately
prior to the Distribution Date. The parties hereto agree that it shall not be
a condition to the Closing for Parent to obtain the Financing or the
Alternative Financing.

  

  

(d) Upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents, (i) Parent will not be insolvent; (ii)
Parent will not be left with unreasonably small capital; (iii) Parent will not

Subsidiaries pending or, to the Parent's Knowledge, threatened in writing
before any Governmental Authority that would have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect or would prevent or materially delay the consummation by Parent or
Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents.

extent such filings are required by applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (i) TDCC, Spinco, Parent and
Merger Sub shall jointly prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC, a proxy
statement relating to the Parent Stockholder Approval (the "Proxy Statement")
and a registration statement on Form S-4 to register under the Securities Act
the Parent Share Issuance (the "Parent Registration Statement"); (ii) TDCC,
Spinco, Parent and Merger Sub shall jointly prepare, and Spinco shall file
with the SEC, a registration statement on Form S-1 (if the Distribution is
effected in whole as a pro rata dividend) or on Form S-4 (if the Distribution
is effected in whole or in part as an exchange offer) to register under the
Securities Act the Spinco Common Stock to be distributed in the Distribution
(the "Spinco Registration Statement" and, together with the Parent
Registration Statement, the "Registration Statements"); and (iii) if the
Distribution is effected in whole or in part as an exchange offer, TDCC shall
prepare and file with the SEC, when and as required, a Schedule TO and other
filings pursuant to Rule 13e-4 under the Exchange Act (collectively, the
"Schedule TO"). Each of TDCC, Spinco, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statements declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to the holders of Parent Common Stock as promptly as practicable
following the date on which the SEC clears (whether orally or in writing) the
Proxy Statement and, if required by the SEC as a condition to the mailing of
the Proxy Statement, the Parent Registration Statement is declared effective.
Each of Parent and TDCC shall also take any action (other than qualifying to
do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified) required
to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with, in
the case of Parent, the Parent Share Issuance and, in the case of TDCC, the
issuance of the Spinco Common Stock in the Distribution and, if applicable,
the exchange of Spinco Common Stock pursuant to an exchange offer. The parties
hereto shall cooperate in preparing and filing with the SEC the Proxy
Statement, the Registration Statements, the Schedule TO and any necessary
amendments or supplements thereto. Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish all
information concerning Parent and the Parent Entities, and TDCC and Spinco
shall furnish all information concerning TDCC, the Business, the Transferred
Subsidiaries and the JV Entity, as may be reasonably requested by the other
parties hereto in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of
the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statements, the Schedule TO and any
necessary amendments or supplements thereto. None of the Proxy Statement, the
Registration Statements, the Schedule TO nor any amendment or supplement
thereto shall be filed or mailed to stockholders without the written consent
of all of the parties hereto (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Proxy Statement shall (i) state that the Parent Board has approved
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, adopted the Parent
Charter Amendment and approved the Parent Share Issuance; and (ii) include the
Parent Recommendation (except to the extent that Parent effects a Change in
the Parent Recommendation in accordance with Section 7.03(d)).

  

  

(c) No amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, a Registration
Statement or the Schedule TO shall be made without the prior consent of the
other parties hereto (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Parent and TDCC, as applicable, shall advise the other promptly
after receiving oral or written notice of (i) the time when a Registration
Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement or a Registration Statement has been filed; (ii) the issuance of any
stop order; (iii) the suspension of the qualification for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger or the Spinco Common Stock issuable in connection with the

the Proxy Statement, a Registration Statement or the Schedule TO or SEC
comments thereon or requests by the SEC for additional information. Parent and
TDCC shall promptly provide each other with copies of any written
communication from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, the
Registration Statements or the Schedule TO and shall cooperate to prepare
appropriate responses thereto (and will provide each other with copies of any
such responses given to the SEC) and make such modifications to the Proxy
Statement, the Registration Statements and the Schedule TO as shall be
reasonably appropriate.

  

  

(d) If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance
shall be discovered by a party hereto that should be set forth in an amendment
or a supplement to a Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement or the
Schedule TO so that any such document would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or fail to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, such party shall promptly inform the other parties hereto and
the parties hereto shall cause an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information to be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, disseminated to stockholders.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) In connection with the filing of the Registration Statements and other SEC
filings contemplated hereby, TDCC shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate with Parent to prepare pro forma financial statements that comply
with the rules and regulations of the SEC to the extent required for SEC
filings, including the requirements of Regulation S-X; and (ii) provide and
make reasonably available upon reasonable notice the senior management
employees of TDCC to discuss the materials prepared and delivered pursuant to
this Section 7.01(e).

  

  

Section 7.02 Parent Stockholders' Meeting. Parent shall take all lawful action
to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the
"Parent Stockholders' Meeting") as promptly as practicable following the date
on which the SEC clears (whether orally or in writing) the Proxy Statement
and, if required by the SEC as a condition to the mailing of the Proxy
Statement, the Parent Registration Statement is declared effective, for the
purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval. Parent agrees that the
obligation of Parent to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting shall not be limited or otherwise affected by (a) the
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to Parent or its
stockholders of any Competing Parent Transaction; or (b) any Change in the
Parent Recommendation. Subject to Section 7.03(d), Parent shall solicit from
its stockholders proxies in favor of the Parent Stockholder Approval and shall
take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the Parent
Stockholder Approval. Parent agrees that it shall not submit to a vote of the
stockholders of Parent any Competing Parent Transaction or Competing Parent
Transaction Agreement (in either case, whether or not a Superior Proposal)
prior to the vote of Parent's stockholders to obtain the Parent Stockholder
Approval.

  

  

Section 7.03 No Solicitation of Transactions.

  

  

(a) Parent agrees that neither it nor any of its Representatives shall, and
that it shall cause each of its Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing nonpublic information), or take any other action to facilitate, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer (including any proposal or
offer to Parent's stockholders), with respect to any Competing Parent
Transaction; (ii) enter into, maintain, continue or otherwise engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person or entity in
furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain a proposal or offer with respect to
a Competing Parent Transaction; (iii) agree to, approve, endorse, recommend or
consummate any Competing Parent Transaction; (iv) enter into any Competing
Parent Transaction Agreement; (v) take any action to approve a third party
becoming an "interested shareholder", or to approve any transaction, for
purposes of Section 13.1-725 of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act; or (vi)
resolve, propose or agree, or authorize or permit any Representative, to do
any of the foregoing. Parent acknowledges and agrees that the doing of any of
the foregoing by Parent or any of its Representatives shall be deemed to be a
breach by Parent of this Section 7.03(a). Parent shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than TDCC and its
Affiliates) conducted prior to the execution of this Agreement by Parent or
any of its Representatives with respect to a Competing Parent Transaction.
Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Representatives to, release
any third party from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to which it or one of its Affiliates is a party in
connection with a Competing Parent Transaction. Parent shall promptly request
each Person (other than TDCC and its Affiliates) that has heretofore executed
a confidentiality agreement with Parent in connection with such Person's
consideration of a Competing Parent Transaction (whether by merger,
acquisition of stock or assets or otherwise), to return (or if permitted by
the applicable confidentiality agreement, destroy) all information required to
be returned (or, if applicable, destroyed) by such Person under the terms of
the applicable confidentiality agreement and, if requested by Parent, to
enforce such Person's obligation to do so.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Parent shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after Parent
attains knowledge thereof) notify TDCC, orally and in writing, after the
receipt by Parent or any of its Representatives of any proposal, inquiry,
offer or request (or any amendment thereto) with respect to a Competing Parent
Transaction, including any request for discussions or negotiations and any
request for information relating to Parent or any of its Affiliates or for
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of Parent or any
of its Affiliates. Such notice shall indicate the identity of the Person
making such proposal, inquiry, offer or request and a description of such
proposal, inquiry, offer or request, including the terms and conditions (if
any) of such proposed Competing Parent Transaction, and Parent shall promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours after receipt by Parent) provide to TDCC
copies of any written materials received by Parent in connection with any of
the foregoing. Parent agrees that it shall keep TDCC reasonably informed of
the status and material details of (including discussions with respect to or
amendments or proposed amendments to) (i) any such proposal, inquiry, offer or
request; and (ii) any information requested of or provided by Parent pursuant
to Section 7.03(c). Parent shall provide TDCC with at least 48 hours prior
notice of any meeting of the Parent Board at which the Parent Board is
reasonably expected to consider any proposal, inquiry, offer or request with
respect thereto (or any lesser advance notice otherwise provided to members of
the Parent Board in respect of such meeting). Parent agrees that it shall
substantially simultaneously provide to TDCC any nonpublic information
concerning Parent that may be made available pursuant to Section 7.03(c) to
any other Person in response to any such proposal, inquiry, offer or request
(or any amendment thereto) unless such information has previously been
provided or made available by Parent to TDCC.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.03, at any time
prior to the receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval, Parent may furnish
information to, and enter into discussions and negotiations with, a Person who
has made an unsolicited, written, bona fide proposal or offer with respect to
a Competing Parent Transaction that did not arise or result from any breach of
this Section 7.03 if, prior to furnishing such information and entering into
such discussions, the Parent Board has (i) determined, in its good faith
judgment (after consulting with a financial advisor of internationally
recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) that (A) such proposal or
offer constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal;
and (B) the failure to furnish such information to, or enter into such
discussions with, the Person who made such proposal or offer would be
inconsistent with the Parent Board's fiduciary duties to Parent and its
stockholders under applicable Law; (ii) provided written notice to TDCC of its
intent to furnish information or enter into discussions with such Person at
least three (3) Business Days prior to taking the first of any such action
with respect to any given Person; and (iii) obtained from such Person an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement and any related agreements shall not include any
provision granting such Person exclusive rights to negotiate with Parent or
having the effect of prohibiting Parent from satisfying its obligations under
this Agreement) and, immediately upon its execution, delivered to TDCC a copy
of such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Except as set forth in this Section 7.03(d), neither the Parent Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify, modify, amend or fail to
make, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify, modify or amend the Parent
Recommendation; (ii) make any public statement or take any action inconsistent
with the Parent Recommendation; or (iii) approve or adopt, or recommend the
approval or adoption of, or publicly propose to approve or adopt, any
Competing Parent Transaction (any of the actions described in (i), (ii) or
(iii), a "Change in the Parent Recommendation"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if at any time prior to the receipt of the Parent Stockholder
Approval and in response to the receipt of an offer or proposal with respect
to a Competing Parent Transaction that did not arise or result from any breach
of this Section 7.03, the Parent Board determines in its good faith judgment
(after consulting with a financial advisor of internationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel), that such offer or proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal and that the failure by the Parent Board to make a Change
in the Parent Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Parent and its stockholders under
applicable Law, the Parent Board may, with respect to such Superior Proposal,
make a Change in the Parent Recommendation; provided, however, that the Parent
Board shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Change in the
Parent Recommendation pursuant to this Section 7.03(d) unless:

  

  

(1) Parent has provided written notice to TDCC (a "Notice of Superior
Proposal") advising TDCC that the Parent Board has received a Superior
Proposal promptly after the Parent Board determines it has received a Superior
Proposal, stating that the Parent Board intends to make a Change in the Parent
Recommendation describing the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal;
and

  

  

(2) TDCC does not, within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the Notice of
Superior Proposal (the "Notice Period"), make an offer or proposal to revise
the terms of this Agreement (any such offer, a "Revised Transaction Proposal")
in a manner that the Parent Board determines in its good faith judgment, after
consulting with a financial advisor of internationally recognized reputation
and outside legal counsel, to be at least as favorable to Parent's
stockholders as such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that, during the
Notice Period, Parent shall negotiate in good faith with TDCC (to the extent
TDCC desires to negotiate) regarding any Revised Transaction Proposal;
provided, further, that any amendment to the terms of such Superior Proposal
during the Notice Period shall require a new written notice of the terms of
such amended Superior Proposal from Parent and an additional five (5) Business
Day Notice Period that satisfies this Section 7.03(d)(2), including with
respect to Parent's obligations to negotiate in good faith with TDCC.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Any disclosure that the Parent Board may be compelled to make with respect
to the receipt of a proposal or offer with respect to a Competing Parent
Transaction or otherwise consistent with its fiduciary duties to Parent and
its stockholders under applicable Law or Rule 14d-9 or with Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act will not constitute a violation of this
Section 7.03; provided, however, that neither the Parent Board nor any
committee thereof shall make a Change in the Parent Recommendation in
connection with such disclosure (it being understood that any "stop, look and
listen" communication by or on behalf of Parent pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
shall not be considered a Change in the Parent Recommendation) unless
permitted by Section 7.03(d). Any Change in the Parent Recommendation shall
not change the approval of the Parent Board for purposes of causing any state
takeover statute or other state Law to be inapplicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(f) TDCC agrees that neither it nor any of its Representatives shall, and that
it shall cause each of its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
nonpublic information), or take any other action to facilitate, any inquiries
or the making of any proposal or offer (including any proposal or offer to
Parent's stockholders), with respect to any Competing Spinco Transaction; (ii)
enter into, maintain, continue or otherwise engage or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person or entity in furtherance of such
inquiries or to obtain a proposal or offer with respect to a Competing Spinco
Transaction; (iii) agree to, approve, endorse, recommend or consummate any
Competing Spinco Transaction; or (iv) enter into any Competing Spinco
Transaction Agreement. TDCC acknowledges and agrees that the doing of any of
the foregoing by TDCC or any of its Representatives shall be deemed to be a
breach by TDCC of this Section 7.03(f). TDCC shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Parent and its
Affiliates) conducted prior to the execution of this Agreement by TDCC or any
of its Representatives with respect to a Competing Spinco Transaction. TDCC
shall not, and shall not permit any of its Representatives to, release any
third party from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill
agreement to which it or one of its Affiliates is a party in connection with a
Competing Spinco Transaction. TDCC shall promptly request each Person (other
than Parent and its Affiliates) that has heretofore executed a confidentiality
agreement with TDCC in connection with such Person's consideration of a
Competing Spinco Transaction (whether by merger, acquisition of stock or
assets or otherwise), to return (or if permitted by the applicable
confidentiality agreement, destroy) all information required to be returned
(or, if applicable, destroyed) by such Person under the terms of the
applicable confidentiality agreement and, if requested by TDCC, to enforce
such Person's obligation to do so. TDCC shall promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours after TDCC attains knowledge thereof) notify Parent, orally
and in writing, after the receipt by TDCC or any of its Representatives of any
proposal, inquiry, offer or request (or any amendment thereto) with respect to
a Competing Spinco Transaction, including any request for discussions or
negotiations and any request for information relating to TDCC or any of its
Affiliates with respect to the Business, or for access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of TDCC or any of its Affiliates with
respect to the Business.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 7.04 Access to Information.

  

  

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, upon reasonable notice,
TDCC shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) afford Parent and its
authorized Representatives reasonable access to the offices, properties and
books and records of the Business; and (ii) furnish to the authorized
Representatives of Parent such additional available information regarding the
Business (or copies thereof), as Parent may from time to time reasonably
request; provided, that (x) any such access or furnishing of information shall
be conducted at Parent's expense, during normal business hours, under the
supervision of Dow's personnel and in such a manner as not to interfere with
the normal operations of the Business; (y) all requests for access pursuant to
this Section 7.04(a) shall be made in writing and shall be directed to and
coordinated with a person or persons designated by TDCC in writing; and (z)
Parent shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, contact any of
the employees, customers, distributors or suppliers of any Dow Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, whether in person or by telephone, mail, or other means
of communication, without the specific prior written authorization of TDCC.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, TDCC shall not be
required to provide any access or disclose any information to Parent or its
Representatives if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to (A)
jeopardize, or result in a loss or waiver of, any attorney-client or other
legal privilege; (B) contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or
agreement; or (C) result in the loss of protection of any proprietary
information or Trade Secrets of any Dow Entity. When accessing any of Dow's

expense, during normal business hours, under the supervision of the personnel
of Parent or its Subsidiaries and in such a manner as not to interfere with
the normal operations of the businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries; (y)
all requests for access pursuant to this Section 7.04(b) shall be made in
writing and shall be directed to and coordinated with a person or persons
designated by Parent in writing; and (z) TDCC shall not, and shall cause its
Representatives not to, contact any of the employees, customers, distributors
or suppliers of any Parent Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, whether in
person or by telephone, mail, or other means of communication, without the
specific prior written authorization of Parent. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall not be required to provide any
access or disclose any information to TDCC or its Representatives if such
disclosure could reasonably be expected to (A) jeopardize, or result in a loss
or waiver of, any attorney-client or other legal privilege; (B) contravene any
applicable Law, fiduciary duty or agreement; or (C) result in the loss of
protection of any proprietary information or Trade Secrets of any Parent
Entity. When accessing any of the properties of Parent or its Affiliates, TDCC

any of its Representatives shall be allowed to sample or analyze any soil or
groundwater or other environmental media, or any building material, without
the prior written consent of Parent, which consent may be withheld in the sole
discretion of Parent.

respect to employee matters.

  

  

Section 7.05 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification.

  

  

(a) The bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification than are set forth in the bylaws of
Spinco, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the
Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of
Spinco, unless such modification shall be required by Law.

  

  

(b) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger;
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
or at Parent's option, Parent, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 7.05.

  

  

Section 7.06 Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents.

  

  

(a) Each party hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable
best efforts to (i) promptly obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and
approvals of all Governmental Authorities that may be or become necessary for
its execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant
to, this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents; (ii) cooperate fully
with the other parties in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations,
consents, orders and approvals; and (iii) provide such other information to

any additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act. Each party hereto agrees to, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates to, make as promptly as practicable its respective
filings and notifications, if any, under any other applicable antitrust,
competition or trade regulation Law and to supply as promptly as practicable
to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the applicable
antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law. Parent shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, pay all filing or notice fees in connection with the
foregoing antitrust, competition and trade regulation Law filings and
notifications.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the parties' undertakings pursuant to
Section 7.06(a), and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, take any
and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any
antitrust or competition Governmental Authority or any other party so as to
enable the parties hereto to close the transactions contemplated hereby and by
the other Transaction Documents as promptly as practicable, and in any event
prior to the Termination Date, including proposing, negotiating, committing to
and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of its assets, properties or businesses or of the

entrance into such other arrangements, as are necessary or advisable in order
to avoid the entry of, and the commencement of litigation seeking the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining
order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the
effect of materially delaying or preventing the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Transaction Documents;
provided that the effectiveness of such sale, divestiture or disposition or
entry into such other arrangement shall be contingent on the consummation of
the Merger. In addition, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
defend through litigation on the merits any Action by any party in order to
avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or
judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the
Closing prior to the Termination Date; provided, however, that the obligation
of Parent set forth in this sentence shall in no way limit the obligation of
Parent to take any and all steps necessary to eliminate each and every
impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law to close
the transactions contemplated hereby prior to the Termination Date. To assist
Parent in complying with its obligations under this Section 7.06(b), TDCC
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, enter into agreements or
arrangements requested by Parent to be entered into by any of them prior to
the Closing with respect to any matters contemplated by this Section 7.06(b);
provided, however, that (i) this Section 7.06(b) shall not require TDCC or any
of its Affiliates to agree to any sale, divestiture, disposition or other
arrangement with respect to any businesses or assets other than the Business
and (ii) the effectiveness of any sale, divestiture or disposition or entry
into such other arrangements shall be contingent on the consummation of the
Merger.

  

  

(c) Each party hereto shall promptly notify the other parties hereto of any
communication it or any of its Representatives receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and
permit the other parties to review in advance any proposed communication by
such party to any Governmental Authority. None of the parties hereto shall
agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect
of any filings, investigation (including any settlement of an investigation),
litigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other parties in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the
other parties the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Each
party hereto shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, coordinate and
cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as the other parties hereto may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act. The parties
acknowledge that Parent shall have the principal responsibility for
coordinating any meetings with or communications to Governmental Authorities,
in consultation with TDCC, in connection with obtaining the consents and
approvals of Governmental Authorities contemplated by this Section 7.06. Each
party hereto shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, provide each other
with copies of all correspondence, filings or communications between them or
any of their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this

Transaction Documents; provided, however, that materials may be redacted (i)
to remove references concerning the valuation of the Business; (ii) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements or applicable Law; and (iii)
as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or
confidentiality concerns. This Section 7.06(c) shall not apply with respect to

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Each party hereto agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
not to, enter into any transaction, or any agreement to effect any transaction
(including any merger or acquisition) that might reasonably be expected to
make it more difficult, or to increase the time required, to (i) obtain the
expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, or any
other applicable antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law, applicable to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents; (ii) avoid the entry of, the commencement of litigation seeking the

and approvals of Governmental Authorities necessary for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.07 Release from Credit Support Instruments.

  

  

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (collectively, the "Parent
Group") to use reasonable best efforts to secure the unconditional release of
each Retained Dow Entity from the Dow Credit Support Instruments identified in
Section 7.07 of the TDCC Disclosure Letter at or prior to the Closing Date,
including effecting such release by providing guarantees or other credit
support and causing a member of the Parent Group to be substituted in all
respects for each Retained Dow Entity that is party to such Dow Credit Support
Instruments, so that the applicable member of the Parent Group shall be solely
responsible for the obligations of such Dow Credit Support Instruments;
provided, however, that any such release or substitution must be effected
pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to
TDCC. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall not permit any member of
the Parent Group to (i) renew or extend the term of; or (ii) increase its
obligations under, or transfer to a third party, any loan, contract or other
obligation for which a Retained Dow Entity is or could reasonably be expected
to be liable under any Dow Credit Support Instrument. To the extent that a
Retained Dow Entity has performance obligations under any Dow Credit Support
Instrument from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause a
member of the Parent Group to, (x) if requested by TDCC, perform such
obligations on behalf of Dow; and (y) otherwise take such action as requested
by TDCC so as to put TDCC or the applicable Retained Dow Entity in the same
position as if Parent, or such member of the Parent Group, and not such
Retained Dow Entity, had performed or was performing such obligations. All
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the release or substitution of
such Dow Credit Support Instruments shall be borne by Parent.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause each Parent Entity to, use reasonable best
efforts to secure the unconditional release of TDCC from each of its and its
Subsidiaries' obligations arising under, or in connection with, the JV
Guarantees (the "JV Guarantee Release"). Any such release must be effected
pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to
TDCC. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with the release or
substitution of the JV Guarantees shall be borne by Parent. From and after the
Closing, Parent shall indemnify TDCC and its Representatives for any and all
Losses to the extent arising from, or relating to, the JV Guarantees.

  

  

Section 7.08 Financing. (a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
use reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and consummate the Financing as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement on terms and
conditions no less favorable in the aggregate than the terms and conditions
described in the Spinco Commitment Letter. Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, (i) use reasonable best efforts to comply with and maintain the
Spinco Commitment Letter and negotiate and execute definitive agreements with
respect thereto, on the terms and conditions contained therein, which terms
and conditions shall not expand upon the conditions to Closing or other
contingencies to the funding on the closing date of the Financing as set forth
in the Spinco Commitment Letter (the "Financing Agreements") and shall deliver
to TDCC a copy thereof as promptly as practicable (and no later than one (1)
Business Day after such execution); (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions in the Spinco Commitment Letter and the Financing Agreements that
are within its control; (iii) fully enforce its rights under the Spinco
Commitment Letter and the Financing Agreements including, at the request of
TDCC, by commencing litigation proceedings against the Lenders; and (iv) use
reasonable best efforts to draw upon and consummate the Financing at or prior
to the Distribution. In the event any funds in the amounts set forth in the
Spinco Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements, or any portion thereof,
become unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Spinco
Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements, or it becomes reasonably likely
that such funds may become unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth
therein, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to arrange to obtain promptly any such portion from alternative
sources, including, subject to Section 7.08(b), on terms that shall not expand
the conditions or other contingencies to the funding, from those set forth in
the Spinco Commitment Letter, in an amount sufficient, when added to the
portion of the Financing that is available, to finance the New Debt and the
Additional Debt (the "Alternative Financing") and to obtain, and, when
obtained, to provide promptly to TDCC a copy of, a new financing commitment
that provides for financing in an amount that is sufficient, when added to the
portion of the Financing that is available, to finance the New Debt and the
Additional Debt (the "Alternative Spinco Commitment Letter"). For the
avoidance of doubt, if the Financing or the Alternative Financing, as
applicable, is available and all conditions to Closing set forth in Article
VIII have been satisfied or waived or will be satisfied or waived at the
Closing, Parent shall take all actions necessary to allow Spinco to incur the
indebtedness provided under the Financing or the Alternative Financing, as
applicable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) To the extent applicable, Parent shall take (or cause to be taken) all
actions necessary, proper or advisable in order to arrange and consummate the
Alternative Financing as soon as reasonably practicable on the terms and
conditions described in the Alternative Spinco Commitment Letter, which
actions shall include (i) using reasonable best efforts to comply with and
maintain the Alternative Spinco Commitment Letter and negotiate and execute
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contained therein, which terms and conditions shall not expand upon the
conditions to Closing or other contingencies to the funding on the closing
date of the Alternative Financing as set forth in the Alternative Spinco
Commitment Letter (the "Alternative Financing Agreements") and shall deliver
to TDCC a copy of such definitive agreements as promptly as practicable (and
no later than one (1) Business Day after such execution); (ii) satisfying on a
timely basis all conditions in the Alternative Financing Agreements within its
control; (iii) fully enforce its rights under the Alternative Spinco
Commitment Letter and the Alternative Financing Agreements including, at the
request of TDCC, by commencing litigation proceedings against the Lenders; and
(iv) using reasonable best efforts to draw upon and consummate the Alternative
Financing at or prior to the Closing. Neither the Alternative Spinco
Commitment Letter nor the Alternative Financing Agreements shall (A) expand
upon the conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding on the closing
date of the Financing as set forth in the Spinco Commitment Letter as in
effect on the date of this Agreement or the Financing Agreements; or (B)
prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. Parent
shall give TDCC prompt written notice (v) of any material breach (or
threatened material breach) or default (or any event or circumstance that,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to
give rise to any material breach or default) by any party to the Spinco
Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements and, if applicable, the
Alternative Spinco Commitment Letter or the Alternative Financing Agreements;
(w) of any actual or threatened withdrawal, repudiation or termination of the
Financing by any of the Lenders; (x) of any material dispute or disagreement
between or among any of the parties to the Spinco Commitment Letter or the
Financing Agreements and, if applicable, the Alternative Spinco Commitment
Letter or the Alternative Financing Agreements; (y) of any amendment or
modification of, or waiver under, the Spinco Commitment Letter or the
Financing Agreements and, if applicable, the Alternative Spinco Commitment
Letter or the Alternative Financing Agreements or any related fee letters; or
(z) if for any reason Parent believes in good faith that it will not be able
to timely obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms and in the
manner or from the sources contemplated by the Spinco Commitment Letter or the
Financing Agreements and, if applicable, the Alternative Spinco Commitment
Letter or the Alternative Financing Agreements. Parent shall keep TDCC
informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Financing and, if applicable, the Alternative
Financing, including by providing copies of all definitive agreements. Parent
shall not, without the prior written consent of TDCC, amend, modify,
supplement, restate, substitute, replace, terminate, assign or agree to any
waiver under the Spinco Commitment Letter, any Alternative Spinco Commitment
Letter, any Financing Agreement or any Alternative Financing Agreement in a
manner that expands on the conditions precedent or contingencies to the
funding on the closing date of the Financing or, if applicable, the
Alternative Financing, as set forth in such agreements or that could otherwise
prevent, impair or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents; provided,
that additional lenders and financing sources may be added to the Spinco
Commitment Letter or any Alternative Spinco Commitment Letter after the date
hereof or thereof with a concomitant reduction in the commitment of the
lenders party thereto on the date hereof or thereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Prior to the Closing, TDCC shall provide, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its Representatives (and use reasonable best efforts to
cause external auditors) to provide, at the sole expense of Parent, all
reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Financing as
may be reasonably requested by Parent and that is customary in connection with
efforts to obtain financing of the type of the Financing or, if applicable,
the Alternative Financing (provided, that such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Business), including
(i) participation in meetings, drafting sessions, rating agency and roadshow
presentations and due diligence sessions; (ii) furnishing Parent and its
financing sources with (A) pertinent information regarding the Business as is

notes (with the exception of a consolidating footnote to the financial
statements for guarantors' and non-guarantors' financial information, as such
information may be expressed in the body of the relevant disclosure document
with disclosure customary for a Rule 144A offering); (x) financial information
of the Business necessary for Parent to prepare a pro forma consolidated
balance sheet and related pro forma consolidated statement of income as of and

the Securities Act, prepared after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Separation Agreement and the Financing
Agreements to be consummated on the Closing Date as if such transactions had
occurred as of such date (in the case of such balance sheet) or at the
beginning of such period (in the case of such income statements), which need
not include adjustments for purchase accounting (including adjustments of the
type contemplated by Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards
Codification 805, Business Combinations (formerly SFAS 141R)); (y) unaudited
consolidated balance sheets and related statements of income, stockholders'
equity and cash flows of the Business for each fiscal quarter ended after

periods for the prior fiscal year) (in each case within 45 days following the
end of such fiscal quarter) and, if the Closing Date shall not have occurred
prior to February 15, 2016, audited financial statements of the Business for
the fiscal year 2015; and (z) a reconciliation of the consolidated EBITDA of

Alternative Financing; (iv) taking customary corporate actions, subject to the
occurrence of the Effective Time, reasonably requested by Parent that are
necessary to permit the consummation of the Financing or, if applicable, the
Alternative Financing; (v) providing customary authorization and management

by Parent and Spinco in connection with the Exchange Offer by TDCC.

  

  

Section 7.09 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the income Tax regulations promulgated
under the Code and the parties hereto hereby adopt it as such. From and after
the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each party hereto
shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure the Tax-Free Status of the
External Transactions, including causing each of the Separation and the Merger
to qualify, and will not knowingly take any action, cause or permit any action
to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken,
which action or failure to act could prevent the Tax-Free Status of the
External Transactions, including preventing the Separation or the Merger from
qualifying, as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. Following the Effective Time, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent
nor any of their Affiliates shall knowingly take any action, cause or permit
any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to
be taken, which action or failure to act could cause either then Separation or
the Merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code or otherwise prevent the parties from achieving the
Tax-Free Status of the External Transactions.

(b) Parent and TDCC shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best
efforts in order for (i) Parent to obtain the opinion of Cravath, Swaine and
Moore LLP, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, dated as of
the Closing Date to the effect that, on the basis of the facts and customary
representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion and
the Tax Representation Letters and on the assumption that the conclusion in
clause (ii)(A) of this Section 7.09(b) is correct, for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and that each of Parent, Merger Sub and Spinco will
be a party to the reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the
Code ("Parent Merger Tax Opinion"); and (ii) TDCC to obtain the opinion of
Shearman and Sterling LLP ("TDCC Tax Counsel"), in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to TDCC, dated as of the Closing Date, on the basis of the facts,
the Private Letter Ruling and customary representations and assumptions set
forth or referred to in such opinion and the Tax Representation Letters, as to
the Tax-Free Status of the External Transactions, including that for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes, (A) the Separation will constitute a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that
each of TDCC and Spinco will be a party to the reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code; (B) TDCC will not recognize gain or
loss for U.S. federal income Tax purposes in connection with the receipt of
the Spinco Securities pursuant to the Separation Agreement and the exchange of
the Spinco Securities for debt of TDCC (the "Debt Exchange"); and (C) the
Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code and that each of Parent, Merger Sub and Spinco will be a party to
the reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code ("TDCC RMT
Tax Opinion"). As a condition precedent to the rendering of the Parent Merger
Tax Opinion and the TDCC RMT Tax Opinion, Parent, TDCC and Spinco, and others,
if required, shall, as of the Closing Date, execute and deliver to TDCC Tax
Counsel and Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP the Tax Representation Letters.
Parent, TDCC and Spinco, and others, if required, shall, as of the date for
filing the Registration Statement, execute and deliver to TDCC Tax Counsel and
Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP the Tax Representation Letters, dated and executed
as of the applicable filing date.

  

  

(c) As of the date hereof, neither TDCC nor Spinco knows of any reason (i) why
it would not be able to deliver the Tax Representation Letters at the
applicable times set forth in Section 7.09(b); or (ii) why TDCC would not be
able to obtain the opinion contemplated by Section 8.03(b).

not be able to deliver the Tax Representation Letters at the applicable times

in Section 7.06) to execute and deliver the Transaction Documents and such
other documents and other papers as may be required to carry out the
provisions of this Agreement and to consummate and make effective the

waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in the
Separation Agreement, in each case without the prior written consent of

obtaining any necessary third-party consents or approvals of Governmental
Authorities, and shall consult with Parent regarding the terms of any
arrangements established pursuant to Section 2.01(d)(iii) or Section 2.02 of

approval is not obtained from the Louisiana Public Service Commission prior to
the Distribution Date with respect to the electricity supply under the Lease
of Electric Generation, Distribution and Interconnection Facilities attached

indirectly, solicit or offer to hire or hire any of the Business Employees, or
otherwise cause or seek to cause any Business Employee to leave the employ of
a Parent Entity, or enter into a consulting agreement with any Business
Employee; provided, however, that (a) the placement of any general mass
solicitation or advertising that is not targeted at Business Employees shall
not be considered a violation of the non-solicitation restriction of this
Section 7.16; and (b) this Section 7.16 shall not preclude TDCC or its
Subsidiaries from soliciting, offering to hire, hiring, or entering into a
consulting agreement with, any Business Employee whose employment with a

the terms and conditions of the Debt Exchange and the parties thereof. TDCC
will be permitted to reasonably direct and control the negotiations and
arrangements in connection with the issuance of the Spinco Securities (and
shall keep Parent informed of all developments with respect thereto) and
financial, legal, accounting and other advisors for TDCC, and Parent and
Spinco shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be
done, all other things necessary to facilitate the Debt Exchange as reasonably
directed by TDCC in good faith (to the extent applicable, Section 3.04 of the
Separation Agreement is incorporated into this Section 7.17 by reference and
shall apply mutatis mutandis with respect to the actions of TDCC and Spinco in
connection with the consummation of the Debt Exchange). TDCC shall provide
Parent with an opportunity to participate in any material discussions with the
ultimate investors, investment banks, managers or other third parties relating
to the terms and conditions of the Spinco Securities and shall in good faith
take into account Parent's comments with respect thereto. Each party hereto
shall cooperate in connection with the preparation of all documents and the
making of all filings required in connection with the issuance of the Spinco
Securities and the consummation of the Debt Exchange. TDCC and Parent shall
coordinate their activities with respect to the Debt Exchange and the other
components of the Financing or the Alternative Financing, as applicable, with
the intent of optimizing the marketing and execution thereof.

Agreement on the part of any party hereto or their respective Representatives;
provided, that nothing in this Section 9.02 or Section 9.03 shall relieve any
party from liability for fraud committed prior to such termination or for any
breach prior to such termination of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in the Transaction Documents; provided,
further, that Section 7.14, Section 9.02, Section 9.03 and Article X shall

then, on the earlier of the date Parent enters into a Competing Parent
Transaction Agreement or consummates any Competing Parent Transaction, Parent
shall pay to TDCC the Termination Fee in cash in immediately available funds,
less the amount of any Expenses reimbursed by Parent pursuant to Section

on behalf of TDCC and Spinco (including fees and expenses of counsel) in
connection with the collection under and enforcement of this Section 9.03,
together with interest on such unpaid Termination Fee or Expenses, commencing
on the date that the Termination Fee or such Expenses became due, at a rate of
interest equal to the Interest Rate. Payment of the fees and expenses
described in this Section 9.03 shall not be in lieu of any damages incurred in

Section 10.03 Public Announcements. None of the parties to this Agreement
shall make, or cause to be made, any press release or public announcement in
respect of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby or otherwise communicate with any news media
regarding this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto, unless such press release or public announcement is required
by Law or applicable stock exchange regulation, in which case the parties to
this Agreement shall, to the extent practicable, consult with each other as to
the timing and contents of any such press release, public announcement or
communication; provided, however, that the prior written consent of the other
parties shall not be required hereunder with respect to any press release,
public announcement or communication that is substantially similar to a press
release, public announcement or communication previously issued with the prior
written consent of the other parties.

  

  

Section 10.04 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is declared invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any
Governmental Authority, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect for so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  

  

Section 10.05 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Disclosure Letters, the
Separation Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements
and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

  

  

Section 10.06 Assignment. This Agreement and the rights and obligations
hereunder may not be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise without the
express written consent of TDCC and Parent (which consent may be granted or
withheld in the sole discretion of TDCC or Parent), as the case may be, and
any attempted assignment that is not in accordance with this Section 10.06
shall be null and void.

  

  

Section 10.07 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except
(a) by an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, each party hereto
that expressly references the Section of this Agreement to be amended; or (b)
by a waiver in accordance with Section 10.08; provided that any amendments or
modifications of this Section 10.07 or Sections 10.09, 10.11, 10.12 or 10.14,
to the extent adversely affecting any of Parent's financing sources, may not
be amended without the prior written consent of each of Parent's financing
sources.

  

  

Section 10.08 Waiver. Any party to this Agreement may (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties;
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
parties contained herein or in any document delivered by the other parties
pursuant to this Agreement; or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements
of the other parties or conditions to such obligations contained herein. Any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise of any other right
hereunder. Any waiver of any term or condition hereof shall not be construed
as a waiver of any subsequent breach or as a subsequent waiver of the same
term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this
Agreement.

Section 10.09 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, only the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and
nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to, or shall confer upon, any
other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including
any rights of employment for any specified period, under or by reason of this
Agreement, other than Section 7.05 (which is intended to be for the benefit of
the Persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such Persons) and Section
10.14 (which is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby
and may be enforced by such Persons).

  

  

Section 10.10 Specific Performance. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the parties hereto would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions
of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
are otherwise breached and that any non-performance or breach of this
Agreement by any party hereto could not be adequately compensated by monetary
damages alone and that the parties hereto would not have any adequate remedy
at law. Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to which any
party hereto may be entitled, at law or in equity (including monetary
damages), such party shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this
Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to temporary, preliminary
and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of
any of the provisions of this Agreement, without posting any bond or other
undertaking. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties
hereto agree that each party shall be entitled to enforce specifically the
other parties' obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the obligation to consummate the Closing and the Parent
Share Issuance and the obligations with respect to the Financing), if the
conditions set forth in Article VIII have been satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) or waived
(where permissible under applicable Law). The parties hereto agree that they
will not contest the appropriateness of specific performance as a remedy.

  

  

Section 10.11 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware. Except with
respect to Actions arising under another Transaction Document that does not
incorporate the dispute resolution provisions contained in this Agreement, all
Actions that, directly or indirectly, arise out of or relate to this Agreement
shall be heard and determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware; provided, however, that if such court does not have
jurisdiction over such Action, such Action shall be heard and determined
exclusively in any Delaware state court or United States federal court sitting
in the State of Delaware. Consistent with the preceding sentence, each of the
parties hereto hereby (a) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal
or state court sitting in the State of Delaware for the purpose of any Action
brought by any party hereto that, directly or indirectly, arises out of or
relates to this Agreement; (b) agrees that service of process in such Action
will be validly effected by sending notice in accordance with Section 10.02;
(c) irrevocably waives and releases, and agrees not to assert by way of
motion, defense, or otherwise, in or with respect to any such Action, any
claim that (A) such Action is not subject to the subject matter jurisdiction
of at least one of the above-named courts; (B) its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution in the State of Delaware; (C) such Action
is brought in an inconvenient forum; (D) that the venue of such Action is
improper; or (E) this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts; and (d)
agrees not to move to transfer any such Action to a court other than any of
the above-named courts.

Section 10.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT
IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION OR LIABILITY,
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE
PARTIES HERETO HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR LIABILITY, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER; AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.12.

  

  

Section 10.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or other means of electronic transmission, such as by
electronic mail in "pdf" form) in two or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

  

  

Section 10.14 Non-Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, it is hereby agreed and acknowledged that this Agreement may only
be enforced against, and any claims of action that may be based upon, arise
out of, or relate to, this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, may only be made against the parties hereto,
and no former, current or future Affiliates, officers, directors, managers,
employees, equityholders, lenders, financing sources, managers, members,
partners, agents or representatives of any party, in each case, who is not a
party to this Agreement, shall have any liability for any obligations of the
parties hereto or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby. Such Persons who are not parties hereto are
third party beneficiaries of Section 10.07, Section 10.11, Section 10.12 and
this Section 10.14. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 10.14 shall not
affect (a) the rights of the Persons party to the Spinco Commitment Letter to
enforce the Spinco Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms; or (b) the
rights and obligations of the parties hereto set forth in Section 7.08.
