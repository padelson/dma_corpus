This STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT, dated as of August 16, 2011 is made and entered
into by and between Ameriprise Financial, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), and Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc., a Florida

herein have the meanings set forth in Section 9.01 hereof.

  

  

WHEREAS, Parent owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock,
$0.01 par value per share (the "Shares"), of Securities America Financial
Corporation, a Nebraska corporation (the "Company");

  

  

WHEREAS, the Company owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of (i)
common stock of Securities America, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("SAI"), par
value $1.00 per share, (ii) common stock of Securities America Advisors, Inc.,
a Nebraska corporation ("SAA"), par value $1.00 per share, and (iii) common
stock of Brecek and Young Advisors, Inc., a California corporation ("Brecek"),
par value $0.001 per share, and preferred stock of Brecek, par value $0.001
per share (SAI, SAA and Brecek, collectively, the "Company Subsidiaries", and
together with the Company, the "Acquired Companies");

  

  

WHEREAS, in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, the
Acquired Companies and Purchaser have entered into an agreement with
Ameriprise Bank, FSB relating to the continuation of the cash sweep
arrangement post-Closing, and Purchaser or the Acquired Companies, as
applicable, have entered into employment agreements with each of Jim Nagengast
and those persons named on Schedule A, which agreements, in accordance with
their respective terms, shall become effective only upon Closing; and

  

  

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Parent proposes to sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser desires to
purchase from Parent, the Shares.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

  

PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES AND CLOSING

  

  

1.01 Purchase and Sale of Shares. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Purchaser shall purchase from
Parent, and Parent shall sell, assign, transfer and deliver to Purchaser, the
Shares, free and clear of Encumbrances other than those arising from any acts
of Purchaser or its Affiliates. At the Closing, in consideration for the sale
and transfer of the Shares by Parent to Purchaser, Purchaser shall pay to
Parent an aggregate amount in cash equal to $150,000,000 (the "Closing Date
Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment as provided in Section 1.03 herein as
it relates to Net Working Capital and in Section 1.04 herein with respect to
the Earn-out.

   
 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

   
 

1.02 Closing.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
the purchase and sale of the Shares (the "Closing") shall take place at the
offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 155 N. Wacker Drive,
Chicago, Illinois 60606 or at such other place as Purchaser and Parent
mutually agree in writing, at 10:00 A.M. local time, on the third (3rd)
Business Day following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted, waiver,
of each of the conditions set forth in Article VI (excluding conditions that,
by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but the Closing shall
be subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) or at such other
time or date as Purchaser and Parent may mutually agree in writing (the date
of such satisfaction or waiver or as Purchaser and Parent may mutually agree
in writing being the "Preparedness Date"); provided, however, that if the
Preparedness Date occurs prior to December 31, 2011 and, as of the
Preparedness Date, (i) Purchaser shall not have obtained the EandO Coverage and
(ii) Parent shall not have obtained the required regulatory approvals in order
to maintain the Acquired Companies' existing EandO coverage through December 31,
2011 at Purchaser's expense pursuant to Section 4.07(b), then Purchaser shall
not be required to close earlier than December 31, 2011 (the date on which the
Closing occurs pursuant to this Section 1.02, the "Closing Date"). Unless the
parties agree otherwise, the Closing shall be deemed to have occurred at the
close of business local time in each applicable jurisdiction on the Closing
Date.

  

  

(b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, (A) to
Parent, the Closing Date Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, free and clear of any withholdings or deductions, to one or
more accounts as Parent may direct by written notice delivered to Purchaser by
Parent at least two (2) Business Days before the Closing Date, (B) the
certificate described in Section 6.02(a), (C) the release described in Section
4.16(b) and set forth on Exhibit D and (D) all other previously undelivered
certificates and other documents required hereunder to be delivered by
Purchaser at or prior to the Closing in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

  

(c) At the Closing, Parent shall deliver to Purchaser (A) stock certificates
evidencing the Shares duly endorsed in blank, or accompanied by stock powers
duly executed in blank, (B) written resignations from each director of the
Acquired Companies, effective as of the Closing, (C) the certificate described
in Section 6.01(a), (D) certificates evidencing all Subsidiary Shares and (E)
all other previously undelivered certificates and other documents required
hereunder to be delivered by Parent at or prior to the Closing in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

1.03 Purchase Price Adjustment.

  

  

(a) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare
and deliver to Purchaser a statement setting forth the Net Working Capital of
the Acquired Companies (determined in accordance with Section 1.03(b)),
including in reasonable detail the basis for the computation thereof, as of
the close of business on the Closing Date (the "Closing Statement"). During
such ninety (90) day period and the period of any dispute with respect to the
application of this Section 1.03, Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with
Parent in the preparation of the Closing Statement and the investigation of
any disputed item, including by providing Parent and its Representatives with
full access during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to
the books, records and personnel of Purchaser and the Acquired Companies that
are necessary and/or relevant to such preparation or investigation.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Net Working Capital" shall be calculated
in the manner set forth on Schedule 1.03(b).

  

  

(c) Purchaser shall have forty-five (45) days after delivery of the Closing
Statement by Parent to review the same and to deliver to Parent a written
statement thereon (the "Protest Notice"). The Protest Notice shall list those
items included in the Closing Statement, if any, to which Purchaser takes
exception and Purchaser's proposed adjustment, including in reasonable detail
the basis for the computation thereof. The failure of Purchaser to deliver
such Protest Notice within such forty-five (45) day period following delivery
of the Closing Statement will constitute Purchaser's acceptance of the Closing
Statement as prepared by Parent. If Purchaser timely delivers a Protest Notice
to Parent and Parent does not give Purchaser notice of its objections to such
Protest Notice within forty-five (45) days following receipt of such Protest
Notice, Parent shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Statement as
adjusted by Purchaser in the Protest Notice. If Parent objects to the Protest
Notice within said forty-five (45) day period following delivery to Parent of
the Protest Notice (the adjustments to which Parent objects being referred to
herein as the "Contested Adjustments"), Parent and Purchaser shall attempt to
resolve the dispute regarding the Contested Adjustments. If a final resolution
thereof is not reached within ten (10) Business Days of Purchaser's receipt of
Parent's objections thereto, either Parent or Purchaser shall thereafter be
entitled to refer any remaining Contested Adjustments to an independent
accounting firm acceptable to Parent and Purchaser (the "Independent
Accounting Firm") or, in the absence of agreement on the Independent
Accounting Firm within five (5) days of notice by either Parent or Purchaser
of intent to initiate such a referral, to KPMG, LLP (who will thereafter be
considered the Independent Accounting Firm). If there is such a referral to an
Independent Accounting Firm, each of Parent and Purchaser agree, if requested
by the Independent Accounting Firm, to execute a reasonable engagement letter
and shall submit to the Independent Accounting Firm not later than ten (10)
Business Days after its appointment, a written statement summarizing its
position on the Contested Adjustments, together with such supporting
documentation as it deems necessary. The Independent Accounting Firm shall act
as an arbitrator to determine, based solely on the materials submitted and
presentations by Parent and Purchaser, and not by independent review, only the
Contested Adjustments that have not been settled by negotiation and shall be
instructed to render its decision within forty-five (45) days of its
appointment or as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable. The decision
of the Independent Accounting Firm as to the Contested Adjustments shall be
final and binding on, and shall not be subject to appeal by, Parent or
Purchaser and may be entered and enforced by any court having jurisdiction.
The Closing Statement shall be revised as necessary to reflect the decision of
the Independent Accounting Firm and the other modifications thereto previously
agreed by Parent and Purchaser. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall bear its
own expenses incurred in connection with the resolution of the Closing
Statement, and the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall
be shared equally by Parent, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other
hand. The term "Final Closing Statement," as used in this Agreement, shall
mean the definitive Closing Statement accepted by Purchaser or agreed to by
Purchaser and Parent or the definitive Closing Statement resulting from the
determinations made by the Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with this
Section 1.03(c) (in addition to those items theretofore accepted by Purchaser
or agreed to by Purchaser and Parent).

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(d) Within fifteen (15) days of the determination of the Final Closing
Statement:

  

  

(i) if the Net Working Capital set forth on the Final Closing Statement (the
"Final Net Working Capital") is greater than Target Working Capital, Purchaser
shall pay to Parent the amount of such excess; or

  

  

(ii) if the Final Net Working Capital is less than Target Working Capital,
Parent shall pay to Purchaser the amount of such shortfall.

  

  

(e) Any payments pursuant to this Section 1.03 shall be made by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by Parent
or Purchaser, as applicable.

  

  

1.04 Earn-Out.

  

  

(a) In addition to the Closing Date Purchase Price, and as additional
consideration for the purchase of the Shares, Purchaser shall pay to Parent
contingent payments (the "Earn-Out Payments") as follows: (i) an amount equal
to the sum of the 2012 Cash Spread Earn-Out plus the 2012 GRLCS Earn-Out for
the 2012 Earn-Out Period; and (ii) an amount equal to the sum of the 2013 Cash
Spread Earn-Out plus the 2013 GRLCS Earn-Out for the 2013 Earn-Out Period.
Purchaser shall calculate the amount of each Earn-Out Payment, which
calculation shall be subject to the provisions contained in Section 1.04(e).

  

  

(b) For purposes of this Section 1.04:

  

  

(i) "Earn-Out Period" shall mean the period commencing on January 1 and ending
on December 31 of the relevant year.

  

  

(ii) "2012 Cash Spread Earn-Out" means an amount equal to the amount of the
Cash Spread for the 2012 Earn-Out Period in excess of $4,500,000 multiplied by
0.90.

  

  

(iii) "2012 GRLCS Earn-Out means an aggregate amount equal to (A) the amount
of GRLCS for the 2012 Earn-Out Period that exceeds $440,000,000 but is less
than $520,000,000 multiplied by 0.215, plus (B) the amount of the GRLCS for
the 2012 Earn-Out Period from and in excess of $520,000,000 multiplied by
0.18.

  

  

(iv) "2013 Cash Spread Earn-Out" means an amount equal to the amount of the
Cash Spread for the 2013 Earn-Out Period in excess of $6,500,000 multiplied by
0.90.

  

  

(v) "2013 GRLCS Earn-Out means an aggregate amount equal to (A) the amount of
GRLCS for the 2013 Earn-Out Period that exceeds $475,000,000 but is less than
$555,000,000 multiplied by 0.215, plus (B) the amount of the GRLCS for the
2013 Earn-Out Period from and in excess of $555,000,000 multiplied by 0.18.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(c) In no event shall Purchaser be required to pay, nor shall Parent be
entitled to receive, Earn-Out Payments exceeding $70,000,000 (the "Earn-Out
Cap") individually, in respect of the 2012 Earn-Out Payment, or in the
aggregate. For the sake of clarity: (A) if the Earn-Out Payment for the 2012
Earn-Out Period calculated pursuant to this Section 1.04 exceeds the Earn-Out
Cap, then such Earn-Out Payment shall be reduced to an amount equal to the
Earn-Out Cap, and Purchaser shall not have any obligation to pay to Parent any
Earn-Out Payment in respect of the 2013 Earn-Out Period; and (B) if the Earn-
Out Payment for the 2012 Earn-Out Period is less than the Earn-Out Cap, then
the 2013 Earn-Out Payment shall be reduced, if necessary, such that the 2013
Earn-Out Payment does not exceed an amount equal to the Earn-Out Cap minus the
2012 Earn-Out Payment.

  

  

(d) Purchaser will pay to Parent the Earn-Out Payment with respect to a
specific Earn-Out Period, if any Earn-Out Payment is owed, no later than March
31st next succeeding such Earn-Out Period. If Parent delivers an Earn-Out
Protest Notice pursuant to Section 1.04(e) and it is ultimately determined
pursuant to Section 1.04(e) that an additional amount for a particular Earn-
Out Period is payable to Parent, then Purchaser shall, within three (3)
Business Days after the parties agree to the determination of the Final
Earnout Calculation Statement or the Independent Accounting Firm's
determination is delivered to Purchaser and Parent, as applicable, pay such
additional amount in accordance with the Final Earn-Out Calculation Statement.
Purchaser shall pay each Earn-Out Payment, if any, in cash in immediately
available funds.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(e) On or prior to March 31st of each calendar year immediately following the
expiration of each Earn-Out Period, Purchaser will calculate the Earn-Out
Payment, if any, for such period and provide Parent with Purchaser's
calculation of the Earn-Out Payment (the "Earn-Out Calculation Statement") and
a copy of the Acquired Companies' financial statements for such Earn-Out
Period on which such calculation is based. Parent shall have forty-five (45)
days after delivery of the Earn-Out Calculation Statement by Purchaser to
review the same and to deliver to Purchaser a written statement thereon (an
"Earn-Out Protest Notice"). During such forty-five (45) day period and the
period of any dispute with respect to the application of this Section 1.04,
Purchaser shall cooperate reasonably with Parent in connection with Parent's
review of the Earn-Out Calculation Statement and financial statements and the
investigation of any disputed items, including by providing Parent and its
Representatives with reasonable access to the books, records and personnel of
the Acquired Companies and, solely to the extent relevant to such review and
investigation, the books, records and personnel of Purchaser. The Earn-Out
Protest Notice shall list those items included in the Earn-Out Calculation
Statement, if any, to which Parent takes exception and Parent's proposed
adjustment, including in reasonable detail the basis for the computation
thereof. The failure of Parent to deliver such Earn-Out Protest Notice within
such forty-five (45) day period following delivery of the Earn-Out Calculation
Statement will constitute Parent's acceptance of the Earn-Out Calculation
Statement as prepared by Purchaser. If Parent timely delivers an Earn-Out
Protest Notice to Purchaser and Purchaser does not give Parent notice of its
objections to such Earn-Out Protest Notice within thirty (30) days following
receipt of such Earn-Out Protest Notice, then Purchaser shall be deemed to
have accepted the Earn-Out Calculation Statement as adjusted by Parent in the
Earn-Out Protest Notice. If Purchaser objects to the Earn-Out Protest Notice
within said thirty (30) day period following delivery to Purchaser of the
Earn-Out Protest Notice (the adjustments to which Purchaser objects being
referred to herein as the "Contested Earn-Out Adjustments"), then Parent and
Purchaser shall attempt to resolve the dispute regarding the Contested Earn-
Out Adjustments. If a final resolution thereof is not reached within ten (10)
Business Days of Parent's receipt of Purchaser's objections thereto, either
Parent or Purchaser shall thereafter be entitled to refer any remaining
Contested Earn-Out Adjustments to the Independent Accounting Firm. If there is
such a referral to an Independent Accounting Firm, each of Parent and
Purchaser agree, if requested by the Independent Accounting Firm, to execute a
reasonable engagement letter and shall submit to the Independent Accounting
Firm not later than ten (10) Business Days after its appointment, a written
statement summarizing its position on the Contested Earn-Out Adjustments,
together with such supporting documentation as it deems necessary. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based
solely on the materials submitted and presentations by Parent and Purchaser,
and not by independent review, only the Contested Earn-Out Adjustments that
have not been settled by negotiation and shall be instructed to render its
decision within forty-five (45) days of its appointment or as soon thereafter
as is reasonably practicable. The decision of the Independent Accounting Firm
as to the Contested Earn-Out Adjustments shall be final and binding on, and
shall not be subject to appeal by, Parent or Purchaser and may be entered and
enforced by any court having jurisdiction. The Earn-Out Calculation Statement
shall be revised as necessary to reflect the decision of the Independent
Accounting Firm and the other modifications thereto previously agreed by
Parent and Purchaser. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall bear its own expenses
incurred in connection with the resolution of the Earn-Out Calculation
Statement, and the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall
be shared equally by Parent, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other
hand. The term "Final Earn-Out Calculation Statement," as used in this
Agreement, shall mean the definitive Earn-Out Calculation Statement accepted
by Parent or agreed to by Purchaser and Parent or the definitive Earn-Out
Calculation Statement resulting from the determinations made by the
Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with this Section 1.04(e) (in
addition to those items theretofore accepted by Parent or agreed to by
Purchaser and Parent).

(f) Following the Closing Date, Purchaser will continue to operate the
Acquired Companies during the period for which Parent is entitled to Earn-Out
Payments in all material respects as previously operated, as one or more
separate entities that continue to own and conduct their respective existing
businesses, subject to this Section 1.04(f) and the business requirements of
Purchaser and its Affiliates taken as a whole. Purchaser will be permitted,
following the Closing Date, to make changes in its reasonable discretion to
the operations, corporate organization, personnel, accounting practices and
other aspects of the Acquired Companies and their respective businesses so
long as (i) such changes are made in good faith, in the best interests of the
Acquired Companies, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates or to conform to
standard practices applicable generally to other Purchaser Affiliates and (ii)
Purchaser shall, and after the Closing Date, shall cause each Acquired Company
to, take or not take, as applicable, those actions set forth on Schedule
1.04(f); provided, however, that nothing herein shall create a fiduciary duty
on the part of Purchaser or, after the Closing Date, any Acquired Company in
respect of any Earn-Out Payment. Parent agrees and acknowledges that the Earn-
Out Payments may be subject to a variety of contingencies, both foreseeable
and unforeseeable, over which Purchaser and, after the Closing Date, the
Acquired Companies, may have no control, including without limitation, the
state of the economy generally and the industry in which the Acquired
Companies operate, changes in interest rates, regulatory changes, the
continuation of existing business relationships and the development of new
relationships. Accordingly, no assurances can be given, nor are any such
assurances given, as to any amount, if any, of any Earn-Out Payments that may
be paid, and Purchaser has not promised Parent any specific amount. Parent
further agrees and acknowledges that (i) Purchaser and its Affiliates are
engaged in activities similar to the respective businesses of the Acquired
Companies, which activities are separate and apart from the respective
businesses of the Acquired Companies, and the results of operations of Parent
and its Affiliates other than, after the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies,
shall have no bearing on, or relationship to, the calculation of any Earn-Out
Payments hereunder, and (ii) the impact of any assets or businesses acquired
by Purchaser after the Closing Date that are merged with or otherwise
contributed to any Acquired Company shall not be considered and shall have no
bearing on the calculation of any Earn-Out Payments hereunder. Parent further
agrees and acknowledges that Purchaser, subject to this Section 1.04(f), shall
have full authority to operate, and allocate resources among, its various
Affiliates and businesses in accordance with its reasonable business judgment.

  

  

(g) Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, cause any of
the Acquired Companies to consolidate with or merge into, or sell, assign or
transfer all or substantially all of the assets, or any portion of the stock
or business of the Acquired Companies in a single transaction or series of
related transactions, to, any other Person unless the Person with whom the
Acquired Companies consolidates, or merges with or into, or to whom such
portion of the Acquired Companies' stock, assets or business is transferred,
assumes all of the obligations of the Purchaser hereunder.

  

  

ARTICLE II

  

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT

  

  

Parent represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows:

  

  

2.01 Organization, Authority and Qualification.

  

  

(a) The Company is a corporation, duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the State of Nebraska. The Company has all
necessary corporate power and authority to own, operate or lease the
properties and assets now owned, operated or leased by it and to carry on its
business as conducted at the date of this Agreement. The Company is duly
licensed or qualified to do business and, in jurisdictions where such concept
is recognized, is in good standing (or its local equivalent) in each
jurisdiction in which the properties owned or leased by it or the operations
of its business make such licensing or qualification necessary under
applicable Law, except to the extent that the failure to be so licensed,
qualified or in good standing individually or in the aggregate would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. A correct and
complete copy of the Organizational Documents of the Acquired Companies, as
amended to the date of the Agreement, has been made available to Purchaser,
and each such Organizational Document is in full force and effect.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) Parent is a corporation, duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Parent has all necessary
corporate power and authority to enter into, execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on
the part of Parent. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Parent and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Purchaser,
this Agreement is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
conveyance and other similar Laws of general application affecting enforcement
of creditors' rights generally.

  

  

2.02 Capitalization; Title to Shares. The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 3,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 948,503.332
shares were issued and outstanding as of the date of this Agreement. The
Shares are the only outstanding Equity Securities of the Company. All of the
issued and outstanding Shares are legally and beneficially owned by Parent,
free and clear of Encumbrances. The Shares are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable, are not subject to any right of first
refusal and were not issued in violation of any Organizational Documents of
the Company. The Company has no outstanding options, warrants, rights,
commitments, preemptive rights or agreements of any kind to which the Company
is a party or by which the Company is bound which would obligate the Company
to issue, deliver, purchase or sell any additional shares of capital stock or
other Equity Securities of any kind in the Company. Upon delivery to Purchaser
at the Closing of the certificates representing the Shares, duly endorsed by
Parent in blank or accompanied by stock powers duly endorsed by Parent in
blank in proper form for transfer, Purchaser will have good and valid title to
the Shares, free and clear of any Encumbrances, and neither Parent nor any
Person other than Purchaser will have any right, title or interest in or to
the Shares. Other than the Shares, there are no bonds, debentures, notes or
other debt or Equity Securities with voting rights on any matters on which
shareholders of the Company may vote with respect to the Company.

10,000 shares are designated as Series A Preferred Stock, 10,000 shares of
which were issued and outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, (2) 15,000
shares are designated as Series B Preferred Stock, 15,000 shares of which were

are designated as Series C Preferred Stock, 15,000 shares of which were issued
and outstanding as of the date of this Agreement (the capital stock referred
to in the immediately preceding clauses (A), (B) and (C), the "Subsidiary
Shares"). Except as set forth on Schedule 2.03, the Company owns all of the
Subsidiary Shares free and clear of all Encumbrances, and the Subsidiary
Shares are the only outstanding Equity Securities of the Company Subsidiaries.
All Subsidiary Shares are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable, are not subject to any right of first refusal and were not issued
in violation of any Organizational Documents of the applicable Company
Subsidiary. The Company Subsidiaries have no outstanding options, warrants,
rights, commitments, preemptive rights or agreements of any kind to which the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them
is bound which would obligate any of them to issue, deliver, purchase or sell
any additional shares of capital stock or other Equity Securities of any kind
in any of the Company Subsidiaries. Other than the Subsidiary Shares, there
are no bonds, debentures, notes or other debt or Equity Securities of the
Company Subsidiaries with voting rights on any matters on which shareholders
of any of the Company Subsidiaries may vote with respect to the Company
Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.03, each Company Subsidiary
(a) is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation; (b) has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate or lease the
properties and assets now owned, operated or leased by it and to carry on its
business as conducted at the date of this Agreement; and (c) is duly licensed
or qualified to do business and, in jurisdictions where such concept is
recognized, is in good standing (or its local equivalent) in each jurisdiction
in which the properties owned or leased by it or the operations of its
business make such licensing or qualification necessary under applicable Law,
except, in each case set forth in this clause (c), where the failure to be so
existing and in good standing, to have such power and authority or to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Other
than with respect to the Company Subsidiaries and except as set forth on
Schedule 2.03, the Acquired Companies do not own, directly or indirectly, any
capital stock, limited liability company or partnership interest, joint
venture interest or other equity interest in any other Person.

  

  

2.04 No Conflicts. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.04, the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby do not and shall not (i) violate, conflict
with or result in the breach of the Organizational Documents of Parent or any
of the Acquired Companies or (ii) assuming that all Consents contemplated by
Section 2.05 have been obtained, and except as may result from any facts or
circumstances relating to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, (a) conflict
with or violate any Law or Governmental Order applicable to Parent or any of
the Acquired Companies, as applicable, (b) result in the creation of, or give
any third party the right to create, any Encumbrance upon the assets of any of
the Acquired Companies, (c) terminate or modify, or give any third party the
right to terminate or modify, the provisions or terms of any Contract to which
any of the Acquired Companies is a party, (d) result in any suspension,
revocation, forfeiture or nonrenewal of any permit, license, qualification,
authorization or approval applicable to any of the Acquired Companies or (e)
violate, conflict with or result in a breach of or default under (with or
without due notice or lapse of time or both) any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any Contract to which Parent or any of the Acquired Companies is
a party or by which Parent or any of the Acquired Companies or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, except, in the case of clause
(ii), as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

   
 

2.05 Governmental Consents and Approvals. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and shall not require any Consent of any
Governmental Authority or Self-Regulatory Organization, except: (a) filings of
applications and notices with, and receipt of approvals or non-objections
from, FINRA (the "Company Required Regulatory Approvals"); (b) pursuant to the
requirements of the HSR Act or under the antitrust or competition Laws of
applicable foreign jurisdictions; (c) Consents set forth on Schedule 2.05; (d)
as may be necessary as a result of any facts or circumstances relating to
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates; or (e) such Consents the failure of which
to obtain, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Statements are derived from the books and records of the Acquired Companies
and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied
throughout the periods indicated (except as set forth in the notes attached
thereto), and present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the Acquired Companies as of the dates thereof and the
results of operations and cash flows of the Acquired Companies for the periods
covered thereby, except that the unaudited financial statements contained in
the Financial Statements omit footnotes and are subject to normal, recurring
year-end adjustments and accruals.

  

  

(b) The books of account and other similar financial books and records of the
Acquired Companies have been maintained, in all material respects, in

statements of such Acquired Company in conformity with GAAP and to maintain
asset accountability, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance

10  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(d) Since January 1, 2009, to the Knowledge of Parent, no director, officer,
employee, registered representative, auditor, accountant or representative of
any Acquired Company has received or otherwise had or obtained Knowledge of
any written complaint, allegation, assertion or claim regarding the accounting
or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of such Acquired
Company or its internal accounting controls, including any complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that such Acquired Company has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices. Since January 1, 2009, there
have been no internal investigations outside the course of customary review
processes and procedures regarding the accounting or revenue recognition
practices of any Acquired Company.

  

  

(e) The Acquired Companies do not have any Liabilities except for (i)

(ii) Liabilities and obligations disclosed, reflected or reserved for in the
Financial Statements; (iii) Liabilities and obligations incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) Liabilities

Action challenging the legality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as set
forth on Schedule 2.07, there are no Actions pending, or to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened in writing, against any of the Acquired Companies by or
before any Governmental Authority or Self-Regulatory Organization which would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material.
Neither Parent nor the Acquired Companies are subject to any judgment, decree,
injunction or order of any Governmental Authority or Self-Regulatory
Organization which would materially impair or delay Parent's ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

2.08 Compliance with Laws; Regulatory Compliance.

  

  

(a) Except with respect to those matters described in Section 2.09, Section

each Acquired Company that acts as an investment adviser that is required to
be registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the
"Advisers Act") or the laws of any state is duly registered. Except as set
forth on Schedule 2.08(b), each Acquired Company that acts as an investment
adviser, unless exempt from registration, is registered, licensed and
qualified in all jurisdictions where the conduct of its business requires such
registration, licensing or qualification except where the failure to be so
registered, licensed or qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

 

  

(c) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.08(c), no Acquired Company that acts as
an investment adviser nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any person that is an
investment advisory representative of an Acquired Company is ineligible or
disqualified pursuant to Section 203 of the Advisers Act to serve as a
registered investment adviser or person "associated" (as defined in the
Advisers Act) with a registered investment adviser, nor is there any
proceeding or investigation pending, or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened in writing by, any Governmental Authority, which would reasonably
be expected to become the basis for any such ineligibility or
disqualification.

  

  

(d) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.08(d), each Acquired Company that is
required to be registered as a broker-dealer with the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") or the securities commission or similar

all approvals, permits and licenses of Governmental Authorities and all Self
Regulatory Organization Authorizations (collectively, "Permits") required to
conduct the business of the Acquired Companies, as conducted on the date
hereof, are in the possession of one or more of the Acquired Companies, as
applicable, are in full force and effect and the business of the Acquired
Companies is being operated in compliance therewith, except for such Permits
the failure of which to possess or with which to be in compliance would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.08(e), since January 1,
2010, none of the Acquired Companies has received any written, or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, oral, notice from any Governmental Authority or Self
Regulatory Organization relating to the revocation, suspension, non-renewal or

(f) Each of the Acquired Companies has complied in all material respects, and
is in compliance in all material respects, with all escheat, unclaimed or
abandoned property and any similar Laws in each applicable jurisdiction.

ARTICLE III

  

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

  

  

Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

  

  

3.01 Organization and Authority of Purchaser. Purchaser is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the state
of its organization. Purchaser has all necessary corporate power and authority
to own, operate or lease the properties and assets now owned, operated or
leased by it and to carry on its business as conducted at the date of this
Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
Purchaser have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the
part of Purchaser. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Purchaser, and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent,
this Agreement is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
conveyance and other similar Laws of general application affecting enforcement
of creditors' rights generally.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

 

  

  

3.02 No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by Purchaser do not and shall not (i) violate, conflict with or result in the
breach of the Organizational Documents of Purchaser or (ii) assuming that all
Consents contemplated by Section 3.03 have been obtained, (a) conflict with or
violate any Law or Governmental Order applicable to Purchaser or (b) violate,
conflict with or result in a breach of or default under (with or without due
notice or lapse of time or both) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of
any Contract to which Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound except, in the case of clause (ii) as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect the
ability of Purchaser to carry out its obligations under, and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement.

  

  

3.03 Governmental Consents and Approvals. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Purchaser do not and shall not require any
Consent of any Governmental Authority or Self-Regulatory Organization, except:
(a) pursuant to the requirements of the HSR Act or under the antitrust or
competition Laws of applicable foreign jurisdictions; (b) Consents set forth
on Schedule 3.03; or (c) such Consents the failure of which to obtain would
not prevent or materially delay the consummation by Purchaser of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

3.04 Litigation. As of the date hereof, no Action by or against Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates are pending or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser,
threatened in any written notice addressed and delivered to Purchaser,
challenging the legality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. As of the date hereof,
there are no Actions pending against Purchaser by or before any Governmental
Authority or Self-Regulatory Organization which would prevent or materially
delay the consummation by Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Purchaser is not subject to any judgment, decree, injunction or
order of any Governmental Authority or Self-Regulatory Organization which
would materially impair or delay Purchaser's ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

3.05 WARN Act. Purchaser has no intention with respect to the Company to
engage in a "plant closing" or "mass layoff," as such terms are defined in the
WARN Act or any similar applicable state or local Law, within ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date.

  

  

3.06 Permits. To the Knowledge of Purchaser, Purchaser (or its successor or
permitted assigns) shall be as the owner of the Acquired Companies qualified
to hold any Permits necessary to operate the Acquired Companies.

  

  

3.07 Qualification to Purchase.

  

  

(a) The Shares are being acquired for investment purposes only for Purchaser's
own account and not with a view to or in connection with any distribution,
reoffer, resale, or other disposition not in compliance with the Securities
Act and applicable state securities Laws.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

25  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Purchaser is an "Accredited Investor" as defined in the Securities Act and
Regulation D thereunder. Purchaser is experienced and sophisticated with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has such
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable
of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Shares. Purchaser
is aware that it must bear the economic risk of its investment in the Company
for an indefinite period of time because the Shares have not been registered
under the Securities Act or under any applicable state securities Laws and,
therefore, cannot be sold unless the Shares are subsequently registered under
the Securities Act and any applicable state securities Laws or pursuant to an
exemption thereunder. Purchaser recognizes the highly speculative nature and
risk of loss associated with an investment in the Company and that it could
suffer a complete loss of the investment and is capable of bearing the
economic risks of such loss.

  

  

3.08 Access; Investigation by Purchaser. Purchaser is an informed and
sophisticated purchaser that is, and has engaged expert advisers that are,
experienced in the valuation and purchase of stock, property and assets such
as the Shares contemplated hereby. Purchaser has conducted its own independent
review of the assets, books, records and Contracts of the businesses of the
Acquired Companies and has met with officers and other representatives of the
Company for the purpose of investigating and obtaining information regarding
the Acquired Companies' operation of their respective businesses and their
financial and legal affairs in order to enable Purchaser to make an informed
and intelligent decision with respect to the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

  

3.09 No Material Impediment. Since January 1, 2010 through the date of this
Agreement, there has not been any event relating to Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries that will or is reasonably likely to prevent the Acquired
Companies from conducting, or materially impede their ability to conduct,
their respective businesses (including fulfillment of their obligations under
all Material Contracts as applicable) following the Closing in the same
manner, in all material respects, as the Acquired Companies, to the Knowledge
of Purchaser, conducted their respective businesses prior to the date hereof.
As of the date of this Agreement, Purchaser does not know of any reason
relating to Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries why all Company Required
Regulatory Approvals from any Governmental Authority or Self-Regulatory
Organization required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including but not limited to FINRA Rule 1017) will not be obtained
on a timely basis.

  

  

3.10 Brokers. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for the fees and expenses
of Jefferies and Company, Inc. and each other broker, finder or investment
banker entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Purchaser.

  

  

3.11 Availability of Funds. Purchaser will at the Closing have sufficient
immediately available funds, in cash, to pay the Closing Date Purchase Price
and to pay any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement and to effect
the transactions contemplated hereby. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a true
and complete copy of the executed commitment letter (together with the
exhibits thereto, the "Commitment Letter") from Phillip Frost, M.D., or an
Affiliate thereof (the "Lender"), pursuant to which the Lender has committed
to provide the amounts set forth therein to Purchaser for the purpose of
funding the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Financing"). The Commitment
Letter has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by
Purchaser and, to Purchaser's Knowledge, the Lender. There are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing other than as specifically set forth in the Commitment Letter.
Purchaser has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing
will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the Financing will not be
available on the terms set forth in the Commitment Letter.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

26  

  

 

 

 

  

  

3.12 Regulatory Compliance.

  

  

(a) As of the date hereof:

  

  

(i) Each of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries and has all Permits necessary to
conduct its business as presently conducted. None of Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries have received any notice of pending or threatened revocation of
any Permits that are necessary to conduct Purchaser's business as presently
conducted.

  

  

(ii) None of Purchaser or Purchaser's U.S. retail introducing broker-dealer
Subsidiaries or U.S. retail investment advisory Subsidiaries is ineligible or
subject to a statutory disqualification as defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the
Exchange Act to serve as a registered broker-dealer, and there is no
proceeding or investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser,
threatened (whether orally or in writing) by any Governmental Authority or
Self-Regulatory Authority, which would reasonably be expected to become the
basis for any such ineligibility or disqualification.

  

  

(iii) None of Purchaser or Purchaser's U.S. Subsidiaries that act as an
investment advisor is ineligible or disqualified pursuant to Section 203 of
the Advisers Act to serve as a registered investment adviser, and there is no
proceeding or investigation pending, or to the Knowledge of Purchaser,
threatened (whether orally or in writing) by any Governmental Authority or
Self-Regulatory Authority, which would reasonably be expected to become the
basis for any such ineligibility or disqualification.

  

  

(b) The most recently filed Forms ADV and Forms BD filed by Purchaser's U.S.
retail introducing broker-dealer Subsidiaries and U.S. retail investment
advisory Subsidiaries have been made available to Parent and such Forms ADV
and Forms BD are complete and accurate in all material respects. Except as set
forth in such Forms BD, there has not been, since January 1, 2009 through the
date of this Agreement, nor as of the date of this Agreement is there
currently pending or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened in writing,
any disciplinary proceeding undertaken by FINRA concerning Purchaser's U.S.
retail introducing broker-dealer Subsidiaries or any of their officers,
directors, partners, employees, registered principals or registered
representatives that would be required to be disclosed on such party's Form
BD. None of Purchaser's U.S. retail investment advisory Subsidiaries have
been, nor have, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, as of the date of this
Agreement, any "advisory affiliates" (as defined in Form ADV) of such
investment advisory Subsidiaries been, in connection with the performance of
his/her duties and/or services for such investment adviser, except as already
set forth in the Form ADV, subject to any other form of liability or
discipline whatsoever, imposed by a Governmental Authority, which would be
required to be disclosed on Form ADV.

4.02 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

  

  

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing (or until the earlier termination
of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.01), upon reasonable notice,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Company to: (i) afford Purchaser and its
authorized Representatives reasonable access to the properties and Books and
Records of the Acquired Companies and (ii) furnish to the officers, directors,
employees, and authorized Representatives of Purchaser such additional
financial and operating data and other information prepared in the ordinary
course of periodic executive management reporting regarding the business of
the Acquired Companies (or copies thereof) as Purchaser may from time to time
reasonably require in order to prepare for the Closing; provided, however,
that any such access or furnishing of information shall be scheduled and
coordinated through the Person(s) set forth on Schedule 4.02(a) and shall be
conducted during normal business hours, under the supervision of Parent's
personnel and in such a manner as not to interfere with the normal operations
of the business of the Acquired Companies; further provided, that the Acquired
Companies shall not be required to disclose any information to Purchaser if
such disclosure would be reasonably likely to (x) cause significant
competitive harm to Parent or any of the Acquired Companies if the
transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated; (y) jeopardize any
attorney-client or other legal privilege or (z) contravene any applicable
Laws, Governmental Orders or Self-Regulatory Organization Authorizations,
fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date hereof.
Notwithstanding anything expressed or implied in this Agreement, Parent shall
not be required to disclose, to any Person, any Tax information or Tax Return
that does not relate to the Acquired Companies.

  

  

(b) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of May 9, 2011,
between Purchaser and Parent, as amended by that certain Amendment to
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of June 9, 2011, between Purchaser and
Parent (as amended, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), shall continue in full
force and effect until the Closing, at which time such Confidentiality
Agreement and the obligations of Purchaser under this Section 4.02(b) shall
terminate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, Purchaser shall be permitted to disclose
Confidential Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to (i)
clearing brokers, (ii) Purchaser's insurers and their respective
Representatives and (iii) Purchaser's lenders, prospective lenders, investors
and any other Person and their respective Representatives in each case solely
to the extent reasonably necessary to allow Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case, after each such Person has
either (x) acknowledged to Parent in writing (which writing may be in the form
of an e-mail) such Person's agreement to be bound by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement or (y) entered into a confidentiality agreement on
terms reasonably acceptable to Parent. If this Agreement is, for any reason,

Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

  

  

4.03 Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents.

  

  

(a) Each of Parent and Purchaser shall use, and Parent shall cause the
Acquired Companies to use, its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
promptly all Consents of all Governmental Authorities or Self-Regulatory
Organizations that may be or become necessary for the performance of its and
the other parties' obligations pursuant to, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement. Parent and Purchaser shall
cooperate in promptly seeking to obtain all such Consents; provided, however,
that Parent and the Company shall not be required to pay any fees or other
payments to any such Governmental Authorities or Self-Regulatory Organizations
in order to obtain any such Consent (other than normal filing fees that are
imposed by Law, including HSR filing fees which shall be paid in equal parts
by Parent and Purchaser). Parent shall cause SAI to prepare and file, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the application
for approval of a change in ownership or control under FINRA Rule 1017 and
Purchaser shall promptly provide all information reasonably requested by
Parent to complete such application. Neither Parent (and Parent shall cause
the Company not to) nor Purchaser shall knowingly enter into any acquisition
or other agreement, make any announcement with respect to any transaction or
take any other action that could reasonably be expected to have the effect of
materially delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any Consents of any
Governmental Authority or Self-Regulatory Organization in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and Purchaser each agree to make, or
to cause to be made: (i) an appropriate filing of a notification and report
form pursuant to the HSR Act and (ii) any other filing or notification
required by any other antitrust or competition Laws of applicable foreign
jurisdictions, in each case, with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement,
and to supply promptly any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any other antitrust or
competition Laws of applicable foreign jurisdictions. If any objections are
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR
Act or any other antitrust or competition Laws of applicable foreign
jurisdictions or if any suit or proceeding is instituted or threatened in
writing by any Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any of
the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of the HSR Act or any other
antitrust or competition Laws of applicable foreign jurisdictions, each of
Parent and Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
resolve such objections.

  

  

(b) Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other party of any
communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental
Authority or Self-Regulatory Organization relating to the matters that are the
subject of this Agreement and, subject to applicable Law, Governmental Orders
and Self-Regulatory Organization Authorizations, permit the other party to
review in advance any proposed communication by such party to any Governmental
Authority or Self-Regulatory Organization relating to the matters that are the
subject of this Agreement. Neither Parent nor Purchaser, as applicable, shall
agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority or Self-
Regulatory Organization in respect of any filings, investigation (including
any settlement of the investigation), litigation or other inquiry related to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the
other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority or Self-Regulatory Organization, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, applicable Law, privilege, Governmental Orders and
Self-Regulatory Organization Authorizations, the parties to this Agreement
shall coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such
information and providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing and (i) in seeking early termination
of any applicable waiting periods including under the HSR Act and any other
applicable antitrust or competition Laws of applicable foreign jurisdictions
and (ii) obtaining the Company Required Regulatory Approvals. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, applicable Law, privilege, Governmental Orders and
Self-Regulatory Organization Authorizations, the parties to this Agreement
shall provide each other party with copies of all correspondence, filings or
communications between them or any of their Representatives, on the one hand,
and any Governmental Authority or Self-Regulatory Organization or members of
their staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Parent and Purchaser have agreed to the forms of notice, substantially in
the forms set forth in Exhibit B (the "Client Investment Advisory Contract
Notices"), that the Company or any of the applicable Company Subsidiaries will
send to each client of the Company and the applicable Company Subsidiaries
under the applicable Client Investment Advisory Contracts as soon as
practicable after the date hereof. The consent of such client to the
assignment or deemed assignment of any Client Investment Advisory Contract
resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed given for
any and all purposes of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby
and the applicable Client Investment Advisory Contract as a result of sending
the applicable Client Investment Advisory Contract Notice to such client,
unless such client, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
has affirmatively stated orally or in writing to the Company or the applicable
Company Subsidiaries that such client does not so consent or shall have
otherwise terminated such client's Client Investment Advisory Contract. If the
Company or any Company Subsidiary receives any such oral or written notice,
then Parent shall cause the applicable Company Subsidiaries to terminate any
such Client Investment Advisory Contract on or prior to the Closing Date. The
consent process set forth in this Section 4.03(c)) shall be the only consent
required from any client of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under the
applicable Client Investment Advisory Contracts in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby for any and all purposes
under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
adequacy thereof).

  

  

4.04 Fulfillment of Conditions.

  

  

(a) Parent shall take all commercially reasonable steps necessary or desirable
and proceed diligently and in good faith to satisfy each condition to the
obligations of Purchaser contained in this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Purchaser shall take all commercially reasonable steps necessary or
desirable and proceed diligently and in good faith to satisfy each condition
to the obligations of Parent contained in this Agreement.

  

  

4.05 Further Assurances; Post-Closing Cooperation. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at any time or from time to time after the
Closing, each of the parties hereto shall execute and deliver such other
documents and instruments, provide such materials and information and take
such other actions as may reasonably be necessary, proper or advisable, to the
extent permitted by Law, to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

  

  

4.06 Preparation of and Assistance with Financial Statements. Parent and
Purchaser shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to prepare or cause
to be prepared, on or prior to the fifty-fifth (55th) day following the
Closing Date, audited consolidated financial statements for the Acquired
Companies, consisting of balance sheets for the years ended December 31, 2009
and 2010 and statements of income and cash flows as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010. The first $400,000 of any fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the preparation of such financial statements shall
be paid in equal parts by Parent and Purchaser. Any such fees and expenses in
excess of such amount shall be paid by Parent. From and after the date hereof,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) provide Purchaser with
such information concerning the Acquired Companies, (ii) provide Purchaser
with reasonable access, during normal business hours and in a manner as not to
interfere with the normal business operations of Parent, to Parent's
accounting personnel and independent auditors (and cause such persons to
reasonably assist Purchaser with Purchaser's preparation of pro forma
financial statements as required by Article 11 of Regulation S-X) and (iii) as
may be required by the independent auditors, deliver representation letters to
such independent auditors, in each case, as Purchaser may reasonably require
in connection with Purchaser's preparation and filing with the SEC of its
periodic reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, any Current Report on Form 8-K
(including the financial statements required by Rule 3-05 and Article 11 of
Regulation S-X in respect of the Acquired Companies) and any registration
statement, in each case as may be amended.

  

  

4.07 Indemnification and Insurance; Termination of Insurance Coverage.

  

  

(a) Following the Closing and for six years thereafter, Purchaser shall cause
the Company not to make any changes to its Organizational Documents that would
adversely affect the rights of persons who are currently or who were officers
or directors of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to claim
indemnification from such entity under the terms of its Organizational
Documents as in effect on the Closing Date. Following the Closing, Purchaser
shall obtain and maintain, at Purchaser's expense, Directors and Officers
Liability Insurance ("DandO Insurance") for the Acquired Companies and all their
Subsidiaries for a period of six (6) years from the Closing. The limits of
such DandO Insurance coverage shall in no case be less than industry norms and
standards for companies in businesses comparable to those of the Acquired
Companies and of comparable size and scope to the Acquired Companies, taken as
a whole. The provisions of this Section 4.07(a) are intended for the benefit
of the current and former officers and directors of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by such individuals and their
heirs and representatives.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) Purchaser acknowledges that all insurance coverage for the Acquired
Companies under policies of Parent and its Affiliates (including policies
issued by third parties under which Parent and its Affiliates self-insure or
provide reinsurance) shall terminate as of the Closing and, following the
Closing, no claims may be brought under any policy of Parent and its
Affiliates in respect of the Acquired Companies regardless of whether the
events underlying such claim arose prior to or after the Closing. In addition,
except as provided in Section 4.07(c), none of Parent or any of its Affiliates
shall have any obligation after the Closing to continue or provide any
insurance coverage or issue any "tail" insurance policies covering the
Acquired Companies under the terms of any such policies. The Acquired
Companies shall not be covered as of the Closing Date under other policies of
insurance directly or indirectly through Parent, including without limitation
workers' compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance
policies. To the extent that coverage is available to the Acquired Companies
under such policies for claims that have arisen prior to the Closing Date,
Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate with the
Acquired Companies to assist in submitting such claims to which such policies
are responsive; provided, that the Acquired Companies shall be responsible for
the expenses of preparing and submitting such claims (including reasonable
expenses of Parent and its Affiliates incurred to assist in such preparation
and submission) and for any deductibles or co-payments legally due and owing
relating to such claims and Parent shall not be required to maintain such
Policies beyond their current terms. From and after the date of this
Agreement, Purchaser shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
replacement Errors and Omissions Liability Coverage ("EandO Coverage") for the
Acquired Companies. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 4.07(b), if Purchaser is not able to obtain the EandO Coverage prior to
the Closing, Parent shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any required regulatory approvals and to, at Purchaser's sole cost and
expense, cause to be maintained, in full force and effect, the existing EandO
policies covering the Acquired Companies until the earlier of (i) December 31,
2011 or (ii) the date that Purchaser provides written notice to Parent that it
no longer requires such policy to remain in force. Purchaser shall provide
Parent with thirty (30) days prior written notice of the date on which it
desires to terminate such coverage pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding
sentence, if applicable.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 4.07,
prior to the Closing, Parent shall purchase, at its expense, a "tail"
insurance policy to provide excess errors and omissions liability coverage
("EandO Tail Coverage") to registered representatives of the Acquired Companies
and their respective Subsidiaries for a period of three (3) years commencing
on the Closing Date. The EandO Tail Coverage shall cover those claims which may
arise from wrongful acts that occurred or were alleged to have occurred on or
prior to the Closing Date, substantially, but in any event no less favorable
than, on the terms set forth on Schedule 4.07(c).

  

  

4.08 Employee Benefit Matters.

  

  

(a) Effective as of the Closing and continuing through the one (1) year
anniversary thereof, Purchaser shall ensure that employees of the Acquired
Companies who remain in the employment of Purchaser or its Affiliates as of
the Closing (the "Continuing Employees") shall be eligible to receive
compensation and employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are no less
favorable than those provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to
the Closing (not taking into account the value of any equity or equity related
grants or transaction related compensation) but solely to the extent such
employees remain in employment during such period. In addition (and without
limitation of Section 4.08(d)), for a period of one (1) year following the
Closing, Purchaser shall or shall cause its Affiliates to provide to the
Continuing Employees who remain in the employment of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) (i) base salaries or wage rates,
as applicable and on an individual basis, at a level equal to or greater than
that provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Closing and (ii) severance benefits which are no less favorable on an
individual basis than the severance benefits that would have been applicable
to each such Continuing Employee under the applicable Acquired Company's
severance Plans or individual agreements, as the case may be, immediately
prior to the Closing, taking into account each such Continuing Employee's
additional period of service and rate of base pay or wages and bonus target
with Purchaser or its Affiliates following the Closing. Nothing in this
Section 4.08(a) shall be construed as (i) establishing, amending or modifying
any Plan or (ii) requiring Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to continue any
Plan or restrict in any way Purchaser's (or any of its Affiliates') rights to
amend, modify or terminate any Plan. Nothing in this Section 4.08 or otherwise
in this Agreement shall limit the right of Purchaser, the Company or its other
Affiliates to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time
for any reason.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliates
in which Continuing Employees will be eligible to participate after the
Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and its other Affiliates
to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such
employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did
not apply to such employees, prior to the Closing, under comparable benefit
plans that are welfare plans and (ii) provide each such employee with credit
for any deductibles and out-of-pocket requirements paid for the plan year that
includes the Closing Date under a benefit plan that is a welfare plan in
satisfying any comparable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the
extent applicable under any comparable plan following the Closing Date with
respect to the plan year that includes the Closing Date.

  

  

(c) Each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for all service with the
Acquired Companies (or service credited by the Acquired Companies) under all
employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained by
Purchaser or its Affiliates in which they participate or in which they become
participants for all purposes, including for purposes of benefit accruals,
eligibility and vesting, but solely to the extent such employee was credited
with service for such purposes under a comparable benefit plan of the Acquired
Companies as of the Closing Date and solely to the extent such credit for
service would not result in any duplication of benefits.

  

  

(d) Purchaser will cause the Acquired Companies to assume and honor any Plan
that contains a contractual severance obligation (the "Assumed Plans") with
respect to any Continuing Employees. Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, terminate any of the Assumed Plans or amend them in any
manner adverse to the participants without the consent of the affected current
or former officer, director or employee for a period of one (1) year
immediately following the Closing.

  

  

4.09 Transition Plan. Parent shall promptly implement the transition plan set
forth in that certain letter agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by and
between Purchaser and Parent and set forth on Exhibit C, and, commencing on
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall maintain and perform, and cause the Acquired
Companies to perform, its and their respective obligations under such
transition plan.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

   
 

4.10 Books and Records; Access.

  

  

(a) For a period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
preserve and retain, or cause the Acquired Companies to preserve and retain,
all corporate, accounting, Tax, legal, auditing or other books and records of
the Acquired Companies (including any documents relating to any governmental
or non-governmental actions, suits, proceedings or investigations) relating to
the conduct of the business and operations of the Acquired Companies prior to
the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during such seven-year
(7-year) period, Purchaser and the Company may dispose of any such books and
records which are offered to, but not accepted by, Parent. Purchaser shall
not, and shall not permit the Acquired Companies to, dispose of any such books
and records at any time after such seven-year (7-year) period without first
offering such books and records to Parent. After the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, provide to Parent, access to
all corporate, accounting, Tax, legal, auditing or other books and records of
the Acquired Companies (including any documents relating to any governmental
or non-governmental actions, suits, proceedings or investigations) relating to
the conduct of the business and operations of the Acquired Companies prior to
the Closing Date.

  

  

(b) After the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies to, permit Parent and its authorized Representatives to have
reasonable access to, and to inspect and copy, all materials referred to in
Section 4.10(a) and to meet with officers and employees of Purchaser and the
Acquired Companies on a mutually convenient basis in order to obtain
explanations with respect to such materials and to obtain additional
information and to call such officers as witnesses.

  

  

4.11 Financing.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser's obligations hereunder are
not conditioned in any manner upon Purchaser obtaining any financing. The
failure, for any reason, of Purchaser to deliver sufficient funds to pay the
Closing Date Purchase Price on the Closing Date shall constitute a willful and
material breach of this Agreement. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt,
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the existence of any conditions
contained in the Commitment Letter or the Financing shall not constitute, nor
be construed to constitute, a condition to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(b) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) arrange the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, (ii)
enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contained in the Commitment Letter, which agreements shall be in
effect as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in no event later
than the Closing, and (iii) consummate the Financing no later than the
Closing. In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable in
the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Commitment Letter, (A)
Purchaser shall immediately notify Parent and (B) Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative
sources as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event,
including entering into definitive agreements with respect thereto (such
definitive agreements entered into pursuant to the first or second sentence of
this Section 4.11(b) being referred to as the "Financing Agreements").
Purchaser shall (x) furnish to Parent complete, correct and executed copies of
the Financing Agreements promptly upon their execution, (y) give Parent prompt
notice of any breach by any party of any of the Commitment Letter, any
alternative financing commitment or the Financing Arrangements of which
Purchaser becomes aware or any termination thereof and (z) otherwise keep
Parent reasonably informed of the status of Purchaser's efforts to arrange the
Financing (or any replacement thereof).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(c) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Parent and the Company and their
respective Affiliates and employees have no responsibility for any financing
that Purchaser may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  

  

4.12 Corporate Name. Purchaser acknowledges that Parent and/or its Affiliates
have the absolute and exclusive proprietary right to all names, tradenames,
trademarks, service names and service marks incorporating the words
"Ameriprise," "Columbia," "Threadneedle" and "Riversource" (collectively, the
"Parent Marks"). Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) not to use the Parent Marks or any
derivation thereof and any corporate symbols or logos related thereto
(collectively, the "Parent IP") in connection with the conduct of its or their
businesses (except to the extent that, pursuant to standalone selling or other
agreements with Parent and/or its Affiliates, they are authorized resellers of
products which bear any Parent Marks); provided, however, that, for a period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the 90th day immediately
following the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies may use the Parent IP on
existing letterhead, advertising materials (irrespective of the form of media)
and sales literature. Within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies to make all filings with the
appropriate Governmental Authorities and take such other actions as may be
necessary to change the corporate name of the Acquired Companies to names
which do not include any of the Parent Marks or any word confusingly similar
thereto.

  

  

4.13 Termination of Intercompany Agreements.

  

  

(a) Prior to or concurrently with the Closing, all contracts or direct or
indirect arrangements or obligations, claims or liabilities, between any
Acquired Company, on the one hand, and Parent or any of its Affiliates, all of
which are set forth on Schedule 4.13(a)(I), shall be terminated and released,
except those agreements set forth on Schedule 4.13(a)(II).

  

  

(b) Prior to or concurrently with the Closing, any Indebtedness owed by any
Acquired Company to Parent or any of its Affiliates shall be cancelled, repaid
or, to the extent permitted under the applicable loan documents, converted
into equity.

  

  

(c) Prior to or concurrently with the Closing, any Indebtedness owed by Parent
or any of its Affiliates to any Acquired Company shall be cancelled or repaid.

  

  

(d) Prior to or concurrently with the Closing, all receivables of the Acquired
Companies from Parent or any Affiliate of Parent (other than the Acquired
Companies) shall be paid and settled.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

4.14 Shared Contracts. Prior to the Closing, Parent and Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to work together (and, if necessary and
desirable, to work with the third parties to the Contracts set forth on
Schedule 4.14 (such Contracts, the "Shared Contracts")) in an effort to (i)
divide, modify and/or replicate (in whole or in part) the respective rights
and obligations under and in respect of the Shared Contracts and (ii) if
possible, novate the respective rights and obligations under and in respect of
the Shared Contracts, such that, effective as of the Closing, (A) Purchaser
(or one or more of the Acquired Companies designated by Purchaser) shall be
the beneficiary of the rights and shall be responsible for the future
obligations related to that portion of each Shared Contract relating to one or
more of the Acquired Companies (the "Purchaser Portion") (such that,
subsequent to the Closing, neither Parent nor its Affiliates shall have any
rights or obligations with respect to the Purchaser Portion of any Shared
Contract) and (B) Parent or one or more of its Affiliates shall be the
beneficiary of the rights and shall be responsible for the obligations related
to each Shared Contract other than the Purchaser Portion (the "Parent
Portion") (such that, subsequent to the Closing, neither Purchaser nor any
Acquired Company shall have any rights or obligations with respect to the
Parent Portion of any Shared Contract). Purchaser shall be responsible for all
expenses or consent fees necessary for the Shared Contracts to be handled in
accordance with this Section 4.14.

  

  

4.15 No-Hire/Non-Solicitation.

  

  

(a) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.15(a), Parent agrees that, for a period
commencing on the date hereof and ending on December 31, 2013, neither Parent
nor any of its Affiliates shall enter into any employment or independent
contractor relationship with any employee of any Acquired Company.

  

  

(b) Purchaser agrees that for a period commencing on the Closing Date and
ending on December 31, 2013, Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies not
to directly or indirectly solicit, induce or encourage any registered
representative or employee of, or any independent contractor working
exclusively for Parent or any of its Subsidiaries ("Parent Protected Persons")
(i) to terminate such employment, representative or independent contractor
relationship or affiliation with Parent or its Subsidiaries or (ii) to enter
into an employment, representative or independent contractor relationship or
affiliation with any Acquired Company. The foregoing restrictions shall not
apply to general solicitations of employment or affiliation, such as general
advertisements, not specifically directed towards such Parent Protected
Persons.

  

  

(c) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.15(c), Parent agrees that for a period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2013, neither Parent
nor any of its Affiliates shall directly or indirectly solicit, induce or
encourage any registered representative or employee of, or any independent
contractor working exclusively for the Acquired Companies ("Purchaser
Protected Persons") (i) to terminate such employment, representative or
independent contractor relationship or affiliation with the Acquired Companies
or (ii) to enter into an employment, representative or independent contractor
relationship or affiliation with Parent or its Affiliates. The foregoing
restrictions shall not apply to general solicitations of employment or
affiliation, such as general advertisements, not specifically directed towards
such Purchaser Protected Persons.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

4.16 General Release.

  

  

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, Parent, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, hereby generally, irrevocably, unconditionally and completely
releases and forever discharges each of the Acquired Companies (together, the
"Purchaser Released Parties") from, and hereby irrevocably, unconditionally
and completely waives and relinquishes, each of the Parent Released Claims. In
addition, Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby agrees not to
bring any Claim against any Acquired Company's existing or former officers,
directors, employees or independent contractors if such Claim (i) may
reasonably be covered under any of Parent's or any of its Affiliates' DandO
liability insurance policies or (ii) may reasonably be considered to require
indemnification by Purchaser, the Acquired Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates under any of their respective Organizational Documents
or pursuant to any indemnification agreement with any such officer, director,
employee or independent contractor. For purposes of this Section 4.16, (i) the
term "Claims" shall mean and include all past, present and future disputes,
claims, controversies, demands, rights, obligations, liabilities, actions and
causes of action of every kind and nature, and (ii) the term "Parent Released
Claims" shall mean and include each and every Claim that (a) Parent may have
had in the past, may now have or may have in the future against any of the
Purchaser Released Parties, and (b) has arisen or arises directly or
indirectly out of, or relates directly or indirectly to, any circumstance,
agreement, activity, action, omission, event or matter occurring or existing
on or prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that "Parent Released
Claims" shall not include (x) any Claims that may arise as a result of events
occurring after the Closing Date or (y) any rights Parent may have under any
Contract set forth on Schedule 4.13(a)(II) by and between or among itself and
any of the Purchaser Released Parties.

  

  

(b) Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the Acquired
Companies to execute a general release in the form attached as Exhibit D.

  

  

ARTICLE V 
 

  

  

TAX MATTERS

  

  

5.01 Parent Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Parent shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold Purchaser
harmless against (without duplication):

  

  

(i) Any breach of the representations or warranties contained in Sections
2.11(c), (e), (g), (i), (j) and (k);

  

  

(ii) Taxes of the Acquired Companies payable for any taxable year or taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date, but only to the extent such Taxes
exceed the amount of Taxes that have been reserved for in the Books and
Records of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing and are included in Final
Net Working Capital; provided, however, that no indemnity shall be provided by
Parent for Taxes resulting from any transaction undertaken by Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) after the Closing;

  

  

(iii) with respect to any taxable year or taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the
portion of the Taxes of the Acquired Companies attributable to the portion of
such taxable year or taxable period ending on and including the Closing Date
(as determined under Section 5.01(b) (each, an "Interim Period")) (Interim
Periods together with any taxable years or taxable periods described in
Section 5.01(a) being "Pre-Closing Tax Periods"), but only to the extent such
Taxes exceed the amount of Taxes that have been reserved for in the books and
records of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing in Final Net Working
Capital; provided, however, that no indemnity shall be provided by Parent for
any Taxes resulting from any transaction undertaken by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) after the Closing; and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(iv) Taxes imposed on any member (other than the Acquired Companies) of any
affiliated group with which any Acquired Company files or has filed a Tax
Return on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis for a taxable year
beginning before the Closing Date and for which any Acquired Company is liable
as a result of filing such a Tax Return on a consolidated, combined or unitary
basis.

  

  

(b) In order to apportion appropriately Taxes relating to any Straddle Period,
the parties shall, to the extent permitted under applicable Law (x) treat, for
all purposes, the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or period
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (y) elect a "closing of the books"
method of tax accounting; provided, however, that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on a time basis, such as the deduction for
depreciation, shall be apportioned on a time basis. Each such Interim Period
shall be treated as a short taxable year and a Pre-Closing Tax Period for
purposes of this Section 5.01, except that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on a time basis, such as the deduction for
depreciation, shall be apportioned on a time basis. In any case where
applicable Law does not permit the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
to treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or period of
such Company or such Company Subsidiary with respect to Taxes that are payable
with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that is
allocable to the Interim Period shall be:

  

  

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (1) based upon or related to income
or receipts, or (2) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable year or period ended
at the end of the day on the Closing Date (provided, however, that (i) for
purposes of determining the marginal tax rate applicable to income or receipts
during such period in a jurisdiction in which such tax rate depends upon the
level of income or receipts, annualized income or receipts shall be taken into
account, if appropriate, for an equitable sharing of such Taxes and (ii)
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on a time basis, such
as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned on a time basis);

  

  

(ii) in the case of Taxes not described in subparagraph (i) above (including
those imposed on a periodic basis or measured by the level of any item),
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case
of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of calendar days in the Interim Period ending on and including
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire relevant period, in each case irrespective of the lien or
assessment date of such Taxes; and

  

  

(iii) all Taxes relating to actions outside the ordinary course of business
occurring on or after the Closing on the Closing Date shall be apportioned to
the period ending after the Closing Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

5.02 Purchaser's Indemnification. Except as otherwise provided in this Article
V, Purchaser shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold Parent harmless
against, any and all Taxes imposed on or with respect to any Acquired Company.

  

  

5.03 Refunds or Credits. Purchaser shall pay to Parent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds any refunds or credits of Taxes within five (5)
days of receipt of such refund or credit by Purchaser or any Acquired Company:
(i) relating to any Acquired Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or (ii)
attributable to an amount paid by Parent or for which Parent is responsible.
Purchaser shall be entitled to all other refunds and credits of Taxes.

  

  

5.04 Tax Returns. Parent shall file or cause to be filed when due all Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to any Acquired
Company for taxable years or taxable periods ending on or before the Closing
Date, and shall timely remit all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns.
Within a reasonable period of time prior to filing, Parent shall permit
Purchaser to review and comment upon such Tax Returns (or, in the case of a
Tax Return that includes any entity other than an Acquired Company, those
portions of such Tax Returns that relate to the Acquired Companies) and shall
make such revisions as reasonably requested by Purchaser. With respect to Tax
Returns to be filed by Parent that relate to taxable years or taxable periods
ending on or before the Closing Date, such Tax Returns shall, unless otherwise
required by Law, be filed in a manner consistent with past practice and no
position shall be taken, election made or method adopted that is inconsistent
with positions taken, elections made or methods used in prior periods in
filing such Tax Returns (including positions which would have the effect of
deferring income to periods for which Purchaser or one of the Acquired
Companies is liable or accelerating deductions to taxable years or taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date). Purchaser shall file or cause
to be filed when due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with
respect to any Acquired Company for all other taxable years or taxable periods
of any Acquired Company, and shall timely remit all Taxes shown due on such
Tax Returns. With respect to Tax Returns to be filed by Purchaser that relate
to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, such Tax Returns shall, unless otherwise required
by Law, be filed in a manner consistent with past practice and no position
shall be taken, election made or method adopted that is inconsistent with
positions taken, elections made or methods used in prior periods in filing
such Tax Returns (including positions which would have the effect of
accelerating income to periods for which Parent is liable or deferring
deductions to periods for which Purchaser is liable). With respect to any Tax
Return required to be filed by Purchaser and as to which any Taxes are
allocable to Parent under this Article V, Purchaser shall provide Parent with
a copy of such completed Tax Return and a statement certifying the amount of
Taxes shown on such Tax Return that is allocable to Parent pursuant to the
principles of this Article V, together with appropriate supporting information
and schedules, at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date (including any
extension thereof) for the filing of such Tax Return, and shall obtain
Parent's express written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, but may in all cases be withheld if such Tax Returns were not
prepared in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence) to such Tax
Return prior to the filing of such Tax Return. For the avoidance of doubt,
Purchaser shall not, and after the Closing shall cause the Acquired Companies
not to, file any amended Tax Return relating to any period (or portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date without the express written
consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to give
Purchaser access to Tax Returns of Parent or its Subsidiaries for the portion
that does not relate to the Acquired Companies.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

   
 

5.05 Mutual Cooperation. As soon as practicable, but in any event within
fifteen (15) days after either Parent's or Purchaser's request, as the case
may be, Purchaser shall deliver to Parent or Parent shall deliver to
Purchaser, as the case may be, such information and other data relating to the
Tax Returns and Taxes of any Acquired Company and shall provide such other
assistance as may reasonably be requested, to cause the completion and filing
of all Tax Returns or to respond to audits by any Taxing Authorities with
respect to any Tax Returns or taxable periods or to otherwise enable Parent or
Purchaser to satisfy their accounting or Tax requirements; provided, however,
that Parent shall not be required to disclose, to any Person, any Tax
information or Tax Return other than that which may reasonably affect the
liability of any Acquired Company.

  

  

5.06 Contests. Whenever any Taxing Authority asserts a claim, makes an
assessment, or otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for which Parent may be
liable under this Agreement, Purchaser shall upon receipt of such assertion,
promptly inform Parent in writing. Parent shall have the sole right at its own
expense to control any proceedings relating to taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date or otherwise relating to Taxes for which Parent may be
liable, and to determine whether and when to settle any such claim, assessment
or dispute, except that Purchaser shall have the right to consent, which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, to any settlement to the
extent such proceedings would materially affect the amount of Taxes for which
Purchaser is liable for tax periods ending after the Closing Date. Except as
otherwise required above, Purchaser shall have the right to control any
proceedings relating to taxable periods ending after the Closing Date (other
than a Straddle Period) and to determine whether and when to settle any such
claim, assessment or dispute, except that Parent shall have the right to
consent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, to any
settlement to the extent such proceedings could reasonably be expected to
materially affect the amount of Taxes for which Parent is liable under this
Agreement. In the case of a Straddle Period, Parent shall be entitled to
participate in any proceedings relating (in whole or in part) to Taxes
attributable to the Interim Period and, in the sole discretion of Purchaser
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), Parent may assume
control of such proceeding at its own expense.

  

  

5.07 Transfer Taxes. Purchaser and Parent shall share equally and be
responsible for the timely payment of all sales (including bulk sales), use,
value added, documentary, stamp, gross receipts, registration, transfer,
conveyance, excise, recording, license and other similar taxes and fees
("Transfer Taxes"), arising out of or in connection with or attributable to
the transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement. Purchaser, or if Parent
is legally required to do so, Parent shall prepare and in a timely manner file
all returns in respect of Transfer Taxes; provided, however, that any such
returns shall be subject to the approval of Purchaser, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld.

  

  

5.08 Tax-Sharing Arrangements. All tax-sharing agreements or similar
agreements with respect to or involving the Acquired Companies shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Acquired
Companies shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

   
 

5.09 Survival of Obligations and Sole Remedy. The obligations of the parties
set forth in this Article V and the representations and warranties contained
in Sections 2.11(c), (e), (g), (i), (j) and (k) shall remain in effect for a
period of sixty (60) days following the close of the applicable period of
limitations. The rights and obligations of the parties with respect to
indemnification for any and all matters relating to Taxes and Tax Returns
shall be governed solely by this Article V and Sections 8.04 and 8.05.

  

  

ARTICLE VI

  

  

CONDITIONS

  

  

6.01 Conditions to the Obligations of Purchaser. The obligations of Purchaser
hereunder to consummate the Closing and purchase the Shares are subject to the
fulfillment, at or before the Closing, of each of the following conditions
(all or any of which may be waived in whole or in part by Purchaser in its
sole discretion):

  

  

(a) Representations, Warranties and Covenants. (i) each representation or
warranty of Parent contained in Sections 2.01 (Organization, Authority and
Qualification), 2.02 (Capitalization), 2.03 (Company Subsidiaries) or 2.21

date), except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be
so true and correct (without giving effect to any qualifications or
limitations as to "materiality," Material Adverse Effect or words or similar
import set forth therein) does not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. The covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement to be complied with by Parent on or before the Closing shall have
been complied with in all material respects, and Purchaser shall have received
a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by an officer of Parent to such
effect.

promulgated, enforced or entered any Governmental Order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that has the effect of making the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibiting the

been received.

hereunder to sell the Shares are subject to the fulfillment, at or before the
Closing, of each of the following conditions (all or any of which may be
waived in whole or in part by Parent in its sole discretion):

  

  

(a) Representations, Warranties and Covenants. Each representation and
warranty of Purchaser contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to
materiality shall be true and correct in all respects and each representation
and warranty of Purchaser that is not qualified by materiality shall be true
and correct in all material respects, in each case as of the Closing as if
made as of the Closing (other than any such representation and warranty as is
made as of another date that is qualified as to materiality, which shall be
true and correct in all respects as of such other date, and any such
representation and warranty as is made as of another date that is not
qualified as to materiality, which shall be true and correct in all material
respects as of such other date). The covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement to be complied with by Purchaser on or before the Closing shall
have been complied with in all material respects, and Parent shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of Purchaser by an officer of
Purchaser to such effect.

  

  

(b) Regulatory Approvals. Any waiting period (and any extension thereof) under
the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws applicable to the purchase of
the Shares contemplated by this Agreement shall have expired or shall have
been terminated.

  

  

(c) No Order. No Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued,

on Schedule 2.07(i) that arise after the date of this Agreement through the
Closing Date and are added to Schedule 2.07(i) in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, if any, shall not have had, and shall not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect;
provided, however, for purposes of this Section 6.02(e), clause (g) of the
definition of Material Adverse Effect shall be disregarded for purposes of
determining whether there has been a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(f) Other Deliveries. Purchaser shall have delivered to Parent the closing
deliveries set forth in Section 1.02(b).

  

  

ARTICLE VII

(c) by either Parent or Purchaser, upon written notice to the non-terminating

Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure
of the Closing to occur on or prior to the Outside Date or (y) Purchaser if

have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing

other party, including any claims for damages based on lost revenues or lost
profits, however caused or on any theory.

INDEMNIFICATION AND SURVIVAL

  

  

8.01 Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements. The
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall expire on the
eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date, except that the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2.01(a) (Organization,

Subsidiaries) and 2.21 (Brokers) shall survive indefinitely. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, the covenants and agreements of Parent
and Purchaser shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms. Any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in respect of which
indemnity may be sought under this Agreement shall survive the time at which
it would otherwise terminate pursuant to this Section 8.01 if a Claim Notice
or Indemnity Notice (as applicable) shall have been timely given in good faith
based on facts reasonably expected to establish a valid claim under this
Article VIII on or prior to such termination date, until the related claim for
indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in this
Article VIII. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the survival of representations
and warranties for matters relating to Taxes are addressed separately in
Article V.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

   
 

8.02 Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, from and after the
Closing, Parent shall indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates, officers,
directors, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Purchaser
Indemnitees") in respect of, and hold them harmless from and against, any and
all Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by a Purchaser Indemnitee by reason
of or resulting from (i) any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or
warranty of Parent contained in Article II of this Agreement, (ii) any
nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part
of Parent contained in this Agreement (other than indemnification for matters
relating to Taxes, which are addressed separately in Article V), (iii) the Med
Cap/Provident Claims and (iv) those matters set forth on Schedule 8.02(a)(I).

  

  

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, from and after the
Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify Parent and its Affiliates, officers,
directors, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Parent
Indemnitees") in respect of, and hold them harmless from and against, any and
all Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by a Parent Indemnitee by reason of
or resulting from (i) any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty
of Purchaser contained in Article III or (ii) any nonfulfillment of or failure
to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Purchaser contained in
this Agreement (other than indemnification for matters relating to Taxes,
which are addressed separately in Article V).

  

  

(c) Except as set forth in Section 8.02(d), the indemnity obligations of the
parties under this Article VIII shall be limited as set forth in this Section
8.02(c).

  

  

(i) No indemnity shall be payable under this Article VIII with respect to
Losses for which the Indemnified Party has not provided the Indemnifying Party
a Claim Notice or Indemnity Notice, as applicable, with respect to such claim,
setting forth in reasonable detail the specific facts and circumstances
pertaining thereto as soon as reasonably practical following the time at which
the Indemnified Party discovered or reasonably should have discovered such
claim (except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is not materially
prejudiced by any delay in the delivery of such notice).

  

  

(ii) No indemnity shall be payable under this Article VIII with respect to any
individual Loss (or series of related Losses) that does not exceed $10,000 (a
"De Minimis Claim"), nor shall any De Minimis Claim be applied to or
considered for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of Covered Losses;
provided that the limitations contained in this sentence shall apply only with
respect to an aggregate of up to $150,000 of De Minimis Claims, and if all De
Minimis Claims in the aggregate exceed $150,000 (such excess, "Excess De
Minimis Claims"), then Parent shall, subject to the other limitations provided
in this Article VIII, indemnify and hold the Purchaser Indemnitees harmless
from the amount of such excess over $150,000, and the amount of such excess
shall be applied to and considered for purposes of calculating the aggregate
amount of Covered Losses needed to meet the Floor and the Liability Cap.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(iii) No indemnity shall be payable under Article VIII until the aggregate of
all Losses in respect of those items specified in clauses (i) and (ii) of
Section 8.02(a), excluding De Minimis Claims but including Losses with respect
to Excess De Minimis Claims ("Covered Losses"), exceeds $1,000,000 (the
"Floor"), and then an indemnity shall be payable for all Covered Losses in
excess of such amount.

  

  

(iv) An Indemnifying Party shall have no further indemnity obligations under
this Article VIII once the aggregate of all Covered Losses paid by it equals
or exceeds $18,000,000 (the "Liability Cap").

  

  

(v) No Indemnifying Party shall have any indemnity obligations for
consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive damages, including
any claims for damages based on lost revenues or profits, however caused or on
any theory.

  

  

(vi) Parent shall have no indemnity obligations under Article V or Article
VIII for Losses to the extent such Losses are reflected as a liability of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary and included in the calculation of Net
Working Capital.

  

  

(d) Certain Limitations and Exclusions.

  

  

(i) The limitations on indemnification contained in Sections 8.02(c)(ii),
8.02(c)(iii) and 8.02(c)(iv) shall not apply to Losses arising from (A) any
inaccuracy in or breach of the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 2.01(a) (Organization, Authority and Qualification), 2.02
(Capitalization), 2.03 (Company Subsidiaries), and 2.21 (Brokers) or (B)
breaches of the agreements contained in Sections 4.02 and 10.03.

  

  

(ii) Losses arising from MedCap/Provident Claims and those matters set forth
on Schedule 8.02(a)(I) shall be subject to the limitations set forth on
Schedule 8.02(d)(ii).

  

  


 

  

  

8.03 Indemnity Procedures. All claims for indemnification by any Indemnified
Party under Section 8.02 shall be asserted and resolved as set forth in this
Section 8.03.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(a) In the event any claim or demand in respect of which an Indemnified Party
might seek indemnity under Section 8.02(a) or 8.02(b) is asserted against or
sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person other than
Parent, Purchaser or any Affiliate of Parent or Purchaser (a "Third Party
Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver a Claim Notice to the
Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that the right of a Person to be
indemnified hereunder shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give
such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, an Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
control the defense of such Third Party Claim, including the right to settle
such Third Party Claim; provided that if the proposed settlement provides for
relief other than the payment of money damages or an admission of culpability,
the Indemnifying Party may settle such Third Party Claim only with the consent
of the Indemnified Party (except consent shall not be required for any portion
of such settlement in which relief is in the form of money damages being paid
by the Indemnifying Party, to the extent the Third Party Claim may be
partially settled thereby), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed and which consent shall not be required if the
Indemnified Party is granted a release in connection therewith. The
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel
in contesting any Third Party Claim, including in making any counterclaim
against the Person asserting the Third Party Claim, or any cross-complaint
against any Person (other than the Indemnifying Party or any of its
Affiliates). The Indemnified Party may, at its sole cost and expense, retain
separate counsel to participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement
of any Third Party Claim, but such counsel for the Indemnified Party shall be
at the Indemnifying Party's expense if (i) the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall have mutually agreed in writing to the retention of
such counsel, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed in a timely manner
to assume the defense and employ counsel or experts reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party in such litigation or proceeding or (iii) the named
parties to any such litigation or proceeding (including any impleaded parties)
include the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and representation of
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same counsel or
experts would, in the reasonable opinion of Indemnified Party, be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party.

  

  

(b) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim under Section
8.02(a) or 8.02(b) against any Indemnifying Party that does not involve a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver an Indemnity
Notice to the Indemnifying Party.

  

  

(c) Without limitation of the other procedures listed in this Section 8.03,
with respect to any Med Cap/Provident Claim that may give rise to
indemnification under Section 8.02(a)(iii) or any matter set forth on Schedule
8.02(a)(I) that may give rise to indemnification under Section 8.02(a)(iv),
Purchaser shall (and shall cause the Acquired Companies to) reasonably
cooperate with Parent with respect to the settlement and/or defense of such
claims, including without limitation, using commercially reasonable efforts to
make available to Parent and/or its Affiliates and/or Representatives all such
employees, witnesses, records, materials and information in Purchaser's and
the Acquired Companies' possession or under Purchaser's and the Acquired
Companies' control (including their respective Representatives) relating
thereto as is reasonably requested by Parent. Without limitation of the
foregoing or of Parent's rights under Section 4.10 herein, the parties agree
that Parent shall be permitted to retain copies of all information and records
related to Med Cap/Provident Claims or to Claims with respect to any matter
set forth on Schedule 8.02(a)(I).

  

  


 

  

  

8.04 Tax Effect.

  

  

(a) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under Article
V or Article VIII shall be increased to take account of any Tax cost incurred
(grossed up for such increase) by the Indemnified Party arising from the
receipt of the indemnity payments hereunder, unless such indemnity payment is
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes pursuant to
Section 8.04(c).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under Article
V or Article VIII shall be reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit
actually realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence of any
such Loss.

  

  

(c) Any amounts paid pursuant to Article V or this Article VIII shall be
considered an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes to the extent
allowed under applicable Law. Purchaser and Parent, and each of their
respective Affiliates, shall prepare and file, and cause their Affiliates to
prepare and file, Tax Returns consistent with the treatment described in the
foregoing sentence, and shall not agree to treating any amount paid pursuant
to Article V or this Article VIII as anything other than an adjustment to the
Purchase Price in any audit, litigation or other proceeding related to Taxes
without the express written consent of the other party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  

  

8.05 Insurance Offset. If the amount of any indemnifiable Losses, at any time
following the payment of an indemnification obligation, is offset or reduced
by the payment of any insurance proceeds, the amount of such insurance
proceeds, less any costs, expenses, premiums actually paid or Taxes incurred
in connection therewith (including but not limited to any future increase in
insurance premiums, retroactive premiums, costs associated with any loss of
insurance and replacement thereof or self-insured component of such insurance
coverage) shall be promptly repaid to the Indemnifying Party. To the extent
that any insurance proceeds are paid to a Purchaser Indemnitee by any
insurance company pursuant to a policy maintained or reinsured by Parent or
any of its Affiliates in respect of any Losses, Parent shall be entitled to
offset such amounts paid against amounts otherwise payable to the Purchaser
Indemnitees solely in respect of such Losses.

  

  

8.06 Exclusivity. After the Closing, to the extent permitted by Law and except
with respect to claims for fraud, the indemnities set forth in this Article
VIII and in Article V shall be the exclusive remedies of Purchaser and Parent
and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and Affiliates for
any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, misrepresentation, breach of
warranty or nonfulfillment or failure to be performed of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Purchaser shall have the right, but not the obligation, to set off
any Losses against payments owed by Purchaser to Parent hereunder. From time
to time, if Purchaser elects to exercise such set-off rights hereunder, it
must give Parent written notice of such election no later than the date such
payment is due and payable in accordance with this Agreement, which such
notice shall include the amount under this Agreement to be set off, and upon
giving of such notice, the amount due in respect of such amount under this
Agreement shall be reduced by the amount set forth in such notice. In the
event there is a "final determination" by a court of competent jurisdiction
that Purchaser was not entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to
the set off amount, Purchaser shall promptly thereafter repay to Parent all
such amounts which are so determined to have been wrongfully set off, together
with interest thereon at a rate of 10% per annum from the date such amount was
set off through the date of payment. For purposes of this Section 8.06, a
determination shall be "final" if any and all appeals therefrom shall have
been resolved or if thirty (30) calendar days shall have passed from the
rendering of such determination (or of any determination on appeal therefrom)
and no party shall have commenced any appeal therefrom.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

   
 

8.07 No Multiple Recovery. No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover
from an Indemnifying Party more than once for any particular Loss, nor shall
any Indemnifying Party be liable or otherwise obligated to indemnify any
Indemnified Party for the same Loss more than once.

  

  

8.08 Article V to Apply to Taxes and Tax Returns. Except as explicitly set
forth in Article V, the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to
indemnification for any and all matters relating to Taxes and Tax Returns
shall be governed solely by Article V.

  

  

8.09 Reasonable Efforts. An Indemnified Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss, including the use of commercially
reasonable efforts to recover under a policy of insurance or under a
contractual right of set-off or indemnity.

10.15 Disclosure Schedules. Each exception set forth in the Disclosure
Schedules is identified by reference to, or has been grouped under a heading
referring to, a specific individual section or subsection of this Agreement;
provided, however, that the inclusion of any item referenced in one section or
subsection of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to refer to any other
section or subsection of the Disclosure Schedules (and accordingly to the
applicable sections or subsections of this Agreement which contain references
to the Disclosure Schedules), whether or not an explicit cross-reference
appears, if the applicability of such item to the other section or subsection
is reasonably apparent. The inclusion of any information in the Disclosure
Schedules shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of the
materiality of such item, nor shall it establish a standard of materiality for
any purpose whatsoever. Parent may, from time to time prior to or at the
Closing, by notice in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, supplement
or amend any section of the Disclosure Schedules, including one or more
supplements or amendments to correct any matter that would constitute an
inaccuracy of any representation or a breach of any warranty, covenant or
other agreement of Parent contained herein. No such supplemental or amended
section of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to cure any inaccuracy or
breach for the purposes of Section 6.01(a) hereof. If, however, the Closing
occurs, any such supplement and amendment will be effective to cure and
correct for all other purposes any inaccuracy of any representation or any
breach of any warranty, covenant or other agreement which would have existed
if Parent had not made such supplement or amendment, and all references to any
section of the Disclosure Schedules that is supplemented or amended as
provided in this Section 10.15 shall for all purposes after the Closing be
deemed to be a reference to such section of the Disclosure Schedules as so
supplemented or amended.

  

  

10.16 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedules and
Exhibits referred to herein) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement among the parties and supersedes any prior understanding,
agreements, or representations by or among the parties, written or oral to the
extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof.
