The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.  
Section 2.5 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS. At the Effective Time,
subject to the provisions of Section 7.11, the Certificate of Incorporation
of the Company shall be amended and restated to be the same in substance as
the Certificate of Incorporation of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (except that the name of the Company will remain unchanged),
and said amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. At the
Effective Time, subject to the provisions of Section 7.11, the Bylaws of the
Company shall be amended and restated to be the same in substance as the
Bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
such    - 10 -   amended and restated Bylaws shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended.   Section 2.6 DIRECTORS.
The directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation until the next annual meeting of
stockholders of the Surviving Corporation (or their earlier resignation or
removal) and until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, as the case may be.   Section 2.7 PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. For
federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. The parties to
this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the Income Tax
Regulations.    ARTICLE III  EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE STOCK OF THE
CONSTITUENT  CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   Section 3.1 EFFECT ON
STOCK. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Sub, the Company or the holders of any securities of
the Company or Sub:   (a) CANCELLATION OF COMPANY STOCK AND PARENT-OWNED
STOCK. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned directly by the
Company or by Parent or any of their wholly-owned Subsidiaries, if any, shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   (b) CONVERSION OF
COMPANY COMMON STOCK. Subject to Sections 3.1(e) and 3.2(e), each issued and
outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled
in accordance with Section 3.1(a)) shall be converted into the right to
receive that number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common
Stock determined by dividing $18.00 by Parent\'s Closing Date Price (the
"Common Exchange Ratio"), which number of shares of Parent Common Stock
(together with any cash in lieu of a fractional share as provided in Section
3.2(e)) shall constitute the "Merger Consideration." As of the Effective Time
and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates")
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) certain dividends and other
distributions in accordance with Section 3.2(c).   (c) CONVERSION OF COMMON
STOCK OF SUB. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.    - 11 -    (d) COMPANY OPTIONS. At the Effective Time,
each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a
"Company Option") under the 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, the 1996 Equity
Incentive Plan, the Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan (the "Company
Option Plans") or any stock option agreements to which the Company is a
party, whether or not vested, shall be assumed by Parent. Each Company Option
so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions of such Company Options immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, any repurchase
rights or vesting provisions and provisions regarding the acceleration of
vesting on certain transactions, other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement), except that (i) each Company Option will be exercisable (or
will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Common Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option
will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Common Exchange Ratio, rounded
up to the nearest whole cent. Parent shall comply with the terms of all such
Company Options and use its best reasonable efforts to ensure, to the extent
required by and subject to the provisions of, the Company Option Plans, and
to the extent permitted under the Code, that any Company Options
that qualified for tax treatment as incentive stock options under Section 422
of the Code prior to the Effective Time continue to so qualify after the
Effective Time. Parent represents that it has taken all corporate actions
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent
Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of assumed Company Options on the
terms set forth in this Section 3.1(d).   (e) ADJUSTMENTS TO COMMON
EXCHANGE RATIO. The Common Exchange Ratio and any other applicable numbers or
amounts shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable
for Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), extraordinary dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock occurring or having a record date on or after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time.   (f) EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. At the
Effective Time, the Company\'s 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
"Company ESPP") shall terminate in accordance with its terms, and the
participants\' accumulated payroll deductions shall be used to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock under the Company ESPP ("Purchase Rights")
which shares shall be converted (in accordance with the Common Exchange
Ratio) into shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent agrees that, as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, Company\'s employees shall be entitled
to participate in the employee stock purchase plan sponsored by Parent (the
"Parent ESPP"), subject to the terms and conditions of the Parent ESPP, and
that service with    - 12 -   Company shall be treated as service with
Parent for determining eligibility of Company\'s employees under the Parent
ESPP.   Section 3.2 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.   (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. Prior
to the Closing Date, Parent shall enter into an agreement with such bank or
trust company as may be designated by Parent and as shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent for the purpose of
exchanging Certificates for the Merger Consideration (the "Exchange Agent").
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for
exchange in accordance with this Article III, through the Exchange Agent,
Parent certificates representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable pursuant to Section 3.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock. Parent shall also make available to the Exchange Agent,
from time to time as required after the Effective Time, cash necessary to pay
dividends and distributions in accordance with Section 3.2(c) and to make
payments in lieu of any fractional shares in accordance with Section 3.2(e).
Any certificates of Parent Common Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange
Agent as provided above shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange
Fund."   (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, but no later than 10 days thereafter, the Exchange Agent
shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares were
converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1, (i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor a Parent certificate representing that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, certain dividends or other
distributions in accordance with Section 3.2(c) and cash in lieu of any
fractional share in accordance with Section 3.2(e) and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of
shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer
or other non-income taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of
Parent Common Stock to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
3.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration that the holder thereof has the right to    - 13
-   receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, and if
applicable, certain dividends or other distributions in accordance with
Section 3.2(c). No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable
to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article
III.   (c) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No dividends
or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented
thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to
any such holder pursuant to Section 3.2(e), and all such dividends, other
distributions and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in
the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate
in accordance with this Article III. Subject to the effect of applicable
escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there
shall be paid to the holder of the certificate representing whole shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the
time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount of any cash payable in
lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(e) and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent
to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock. Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent cash for these
purposes.   (d) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN THE COMPANY COMMON STOCK.
All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificates, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation\'s obligation to
pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to
the Effective Time that may have been authorized or made by the Company on
such shares of Company Common Stock that remain unpaid at the Effective Time,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article III, except as otherwise provided by law.   (e) NO
FRACTIONAL SHARES.   (i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates, no dividend or distribution of Parent shall relate to such
fractional share interests and such fractional share interests will
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of
Parent.   (ii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time,
Parent shall pay to each former holder of Company Common Stock an amount in
cash equal to the    - 14 -   product obtained by multiplying (A) the
fractional share interest to which such former holder (after taking into
account all shares of Company Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such
holder) would otherwise be entitled by (B) Parent\'s Closing Date Price.  
(iii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash,
if any, to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock with respect to any
fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent will make available such
amounts to such holders of Company Common Stock subject to and in accordance
with the terms of Section 3.2(c).   (f) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the
Certificates for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration and any dividends
or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock.   (g) NO LIABILITY.
None of Parent, the Company, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Parent Common
Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the
Exchange Fund in each case properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years after the
Effective Time. and shall not previously have been required to be escheated
to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger
Consideration or cash, dividends or distributions in respect of
such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become
the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.   (h) INVESTMENT OF EXCHANGE FUND. The
Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to Parent.   (i) LOST CERTIFICATES. If
any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation or Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against either of them with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration and unpaid dividends and distributions
on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof, in each case
pursuant to this Agreement.   (j) WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Each of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax law. To    - 15 -   the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.   Section 3.3 FURTHER ASSURANCES.
At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the Company or Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or
Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger.   ARTICLE IV  STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL; BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Subsidiaries is subject which restrict the rights of the Company or such
Subsidiary to use any Intellectual Property, or other agreements which

part of Parent or Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the
Registration Rights Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Sub,
as    - 35 -   applicable, and, assuming this Agreement constitutes
valid and binding agreements of the other parties hereto, this Agreement
constitutes valid and binding agreements of Parent and Sub (as appropriate),

recognized reputation) to be at least as favorable to the Company\'s
stockholders as such Superior Proposal. The Company agrees that it will use
its best efforts to promptly inform its directors, officers, key employees,
agents and representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section
7.9.   (b) During the Window Period, and at any time thereafter if the
Board of Directors of the Company shall have effected a Change in
Company Recommendation, the Company may engage in discussions or negotiations
with, or provide information to, any Person in response to a bona fide
written Takeover Proposal by any such Person not solicited by the Company in
violation of this Section 7.9, if and only to the extent that, (i) such
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (ii) prior to providing
any non-public information or data to any person in connection with a

any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or similar
applicable self-regulatory organization.   Section 7.11 INDEMNIFICATION AND
INSURANCE. Parent and Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers, employees
or agents of the Company (the "Indemnified Parties") as provided in its
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or in any agreement shall be assumed
by Parent at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect as direct obligations of both the Surviving
Corporation and Parent in accordance with their terms. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation
and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties
as those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as in
effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified
Party or of individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were
employees or agents of the Company, unless such modification is required by
law. In addition, for a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, to the extent
available, directors\' and officers\' liability insurance covering
those persons who are currently covered by the Company\'s directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance policy on terms equivalent in all material
respects to those applicable to the current directors and officers of the
Company; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event will Parent be required to
expend an annual premium for such coverage in excess of 200% of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if the
annual premium payable for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount,
Parent shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for an annual premium not exceeding such amount. The provisions of
this Section 7.11 are (a) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and (b) in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such Indemnified Party may have by contract or otherwise.  
Section 7.12 ACCOUNTANTS\' "COMFORT" LETTERS. The Company and Parent will
each use reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to each other
letters from their respective independent accountants, dated a date
within two business days before the date of the Registration Statement, in

comfort letters delivered by independent accountants in connection with
registration statements on Form S-4 under the Securities Act.   Section
7.13 ADDITIONAL REPORTS. The Company and Parent shall each furnish to the
other copies of any reports of the type referred to in Sections 5.4 and 6.4
that it files with the SEC on or after the date hereof, and each of the
Company and Parent, as the case may be,    - 47 -   represents and
warrants that as of the respective dates thereof, such reports will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Any unaudited consolidated interim financial statements
included in such reports (including any related notes and schedules) will
fairly present the financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries or Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
as of the dates thereof and the results of operations and changes in
financial position or other information included therein for the periods or
as of the date then ended (subject, where appropriate, to normal year-end

Company Termination Fee Event entitling Parent to the payment of a
Termination Fee hereunder.   (d) In addition to the foregoing, upon the
occurrence of a Company Termination Fee Event the Company shall, at the time
any related Termination Fee is due and payable and upon submission of one or
more statements therefor, accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation,
reimburse Parent for up to $1,000,000 of all out of pocket costs, fees and

party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or (c)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other party

thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other
