conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Newco shall, pursuant to
the provisions of the DGCL, be merged with and into the Company (the "
**Merger** "), and the separate corporate existence of Newco shall thereupon
cease in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL. The Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger and shall continue to exist as said
surviving corporation under its present name pursuant to the provisions of the
DGCL. The separate corporate existence of the Company with all its rights,
privileges, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The
Merger shall have the effects specified in the DGCL and this Agreement. From
and after the Effective Time, the Company is sometimes referred to herein as
the " **Surviving Corporation**."

 



 

 **Section 2.2** **_Certificate of Merger_**. On the Closing Date, the
parties hereto shall cause a certificate of merger in the form of _Exhibit A_
attached hereto (the " **Certificate of Merger** ") to be properly executed
and filed in accordance with the DGCL and shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall be effective at the time
and on the date of the filing of the Certificate of Merger in accordance with
the DGCL or at such subsequent time as Parent and the Company shall agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger (the " **Effective Time** ").

 



 

 **Section 2.3** **_Certificate of Incorporation_**. The certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated at
and as of the Effective Time to read as did the certificate of incorporation
of Newco immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the name of the

incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall continue in full force and
effect until further amended in the manner prescribed by the provisions of the
DGCL.

 



 

 **Section 2.4** **_Bylaws_**. The bylaws of Newco in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until amended in accordance with applicable Law.

resignation or removal.

 



 

 **Section 2.6** **_Directors_**. The individuals identified in writing by
Parent prior to the Closing Date shall be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation and will serve until their successors are duly elected or

continue to exist as said surviving corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent pursuant to the provisions of the DGCL and the Subsequent Merger
Agreement. On the Closing Date and immediately following the Effective Time,

the Subsequent Merger. The Subsequent Merger shall be effective at the time

the Stockholder Representative to pay expenses incurred by Stockholder
Representative in its capacity as Stockholder Representative;

 



 

(v) to such accounts of the Company or the CompanyÂ’s payroll provider

(vi) an amount equal to the product of the Per Share Stockholder Closing
Payment _multiplied_ by the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on

and (ii) Dissenting Shares) (the " **Closing Stockholder Payment** ") (such
aggregate Closing Stockholder Payment as set forth in the Securityholder

available funds into an account established pursuant to the Paying Agent
Agreement (such account, the " **Payment Fund** ").

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a portion of
the Closing Stockholder Payment equal to the Stock Payment Amount shall be

of Focus Stock would otherwise be issuable pursuant to this _Section 2.8(b)_,
such fraction shall be rounded up or down to the nearest whole number (i.e.,
up to one whole share of Focus Stock or down to zero), and the cash portion of
the Closing Stockholder Payment shall be adjusted accordingly.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company
Stockholders have agreed that the holders of Options shall receive their pro

pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)(v)_ rather than following the Closing as
contemplated by _Sections 2.15(a)_ and _(b)_ with a corresponding reduction
to the Closing Stockholder Payment (such that the amount of the Six-Month
Payment and the Twelve-Month Payment payable following Closing remains
unchanged but shall be payable only to the Company Stockholders and not the
holders of Options) and all payments of Merger consideration hereunder shall
be adjusted accordingly and reflected in the Securityholder Payment Schedule
delivered pursuant to _Section 2.14(b)_.

any of the Subsidiaries and (ii) Dissenting Shares) shall be canceled and

in _Section 2.10(g)_.

 



 

(b) _Treasury Shares_. Each share of Common Stock held in the treasury of the

virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders

Newco issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
without any action on the part of Newco, be converted on an one-for-one basis
into shares of the corresponding class of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

(d) _Holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Shares) shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,
except the right to receive the Per Share Stockholder Merger Consideration, as
and when payable in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without
interest thereon, with respect to each of the shares represented thereby.

 



 

 **Section 2.10** **_Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares;
Withholding_**.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Stockholder Representative
shall appoint and enter into a customary exchange agreement (the " **Paying
Agent Agreement** ") with a nationally-recognized, mutually acceptable paying
agent (the " **Paying Agent** ").

 



     

 

 



 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall
mail to each Company Stockholder of record a letter of transmittal,
substantially in the form of _Exhibit D_ attached hereto (the " **Letter of
Transmittal** "). Payment to a Company Stockholder of its portion of the
consideration under this Agreement shall be subject to and conditioned upon
such Company StockholderÂ’s delivery to the Paying Agent of a properly
completed Letter of Transmittal, together with all related items required
thereby, including the lock-up agreement attached thereto. Thereafter, upon
surrender to the Company of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Shares), together
with such duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of each such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall receive from the Paying Agent promptly
after Closing in exchange therefor, the Closing Stockholder Payment payable to
such holder as set forth on the Securityholder Payment Schedule, in the form
of Focus Stock and cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement, without interest.
Parent and the Company shall make reasonable efforts to cause the Paying Agent
to initiate payment on the Closing Date to all holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares who submitted their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, along
with duly executed Letters of Transmittal, at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date. Each Certificate or Book-Entry Shares surrendered
pursuant to this _Section 2.10(b)_ shall be canceled upon consummation of the
Merger. If payment or delivery is to be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name a Certificate so surrendered is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be, to the
satisfaction of Parent, properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for
transfer, that the signatures on the Certificate or any related stock power
shall be properly guaranteed and that the Person requesting such payment
either pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. As of the Effective Time and until surrendered in accordance with
the provisions of this _Section 2.10_ by the holder thereof, each Certificate
or Book-Entry Share (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares canceled
pursuant to _Section 2.9(d)_ and Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
representing Dissenting Shares) shall represent for all purposes only the
right to receive such holderÂ’s Per Share Stockholder Merger Consideration
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share as set forth in the
Securityholder Payment Schedule, payable in cash and Focus Stock pursuant to
this _Section 2.10_, in the manner and at the times provided for by this
Agreement, without interest. All cash and Focus Stock paid upon surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this _Section 2.10_
shall be deemed to have been paid in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Common Stock represented thereby.

 



 

(c) In the event that any Certificate (other than any Certificate representing
Dissenting Shares) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact and related indemnity by the registered holder of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate in form and substance acceptable to
Parent, the Paying Agent will deliver to such registered holder in exchange
for such affidavit and related indemnity such registered holderÂ’s Per Share
Stockholder Merger Consideration represented by such Certificate as set forth
in the Securityholder Payment Schedule, payable in cash and Focus Stock
pursuant to this _Section 2.10_, in the manner and at the times provided for
by this Agreement, without interest.

 



 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates (other than

 



     

 

 



 

Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) are presented to Parent, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Per Share Stockholder Merger
Consideration multiplied by the number of Outstanding Common Shares
represented by such Certificate, as provided for, and in accordance with, the
provisions of this _Section 2.10_.

 



 

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains undistributed for twelve
(12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Ultimate
Surviving Corporation, and any holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
who have not theretofore complied with this Agreement and the instructions set
forth in the Letter of Transmittal provided to such holders in accordance with
this Agreement shall thereafter look only to the Ultimate Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Per Share Stockholder Merger Consideration to
which they are entitled.

 



 

(f) None of Parent, Newco, Merger Sub II or the Company shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any cash or Focus Stock delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to
seven (7) years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which any payment pursuant to this Agreement would otherwise escheat
to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity), the cash and Focus
Stock payment in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, unless
otherwise provided by applicable Law, become the property of the Ultimate
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all Liens.

 



 

(g) Each of Parent, Newco, Merger Sub II, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Ultimate Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other applicable
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts (1) shall, to the extent required
by applicable Law, be remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity and (2)
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

 **Section 2.11** **_Dissenting Shares_**. Each share of Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time held by stockholders
who shall have properly exercised their appraisal rights with respect thereto
under Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares of Common Stock, the " **Dissenting
Shares** ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stockholder Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger, but shall only be
entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that each
Dissenting Share held by a stockholder who shall thereafter withdraw his or
her demand for appraisal or shall fail to perfect his or her right to such
payment as provided in such Section 262 shall be deemed to be converted, as of
the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Per Share Stockholder Merger
Consideration, in the form such holder otherwise would have been entitled to
receive as a result of the Merger.

 



 

 **Section 2.12** **_Options_**. As of the Effective Time, and without any
action on the part of any holder thereof, each Option then outstanding,
whether or not otherwise exercisable, shall be canceled and converted into the
right to receive the Optionholder Merger Consideration. The

 



      

 

 



 

Optionholder Closing Payments shall be paid by the Company on the Closing Date
to the holders of those Options which have been canceled and converted into
the right to receive the Optionholder Merger Consideration. The remaining
Optionholder Merger Consideration, if any, shall be payable in cash to the
holders of the Options in accordance with, and at the times set forth in, this
Agreement, without interest thereon. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all actions reasonably necessary to effect this _Section 2.12
_under the Option Plan and all Option Agreements, including obtaining approval
by the board of directors of the Company or a committee thereof. All amounts
payable to holders of Options in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement
shall be subject to and reduced by any applicable Tax withholding amounts as
provided in _Section 2.10(g)_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, any payment of the Optionholder Merger
Consideration to any current or former employee of any Acquired Company for
which employment Tax withholding is required will be provided to the Ultimate
Surviving Corporation or one of its Affiliates for payment to such current or
former employee through the Ultimate Surviving CorporationÂ’s (or its
AffiliateÂ’s) payroll processing service or system.

 



 

 **Section 2.13** **_Closing_**. The closing of the transactions contemplated
hereby (the " **Closing** ") shall take place at the offices of Dechert LLP,
at Three Bryant Park, 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY, 10036-6797 at
10:00 A.M. Eastern time on the third (3rd) Business Day after the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VI_ (other than those
conditions that by their terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing), or on
such date and time as the Company and Parent shall mutually agree. The date of
the Closing is herein called the " **Closing Date**."

 



 

 **Section 2.14** **_Post-Closing Adjustment; Securityholder Payment
Schedule_.**

 



 

(a) _Closing Adjustment_. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent the Estimated Closing Statement,
together with, in respect of each item included therein, the supporting
calculations, basis and components thereof as well as related invoices in
respect of Estimated Seller Expenses and a certificate of the Company executed
by its chief executive officer or its chief financial officer that the
Estimated Closing Statement was prepared in accordance with the Agreed
Accounting Principles.

 



 

(b) _Securityholder Payment Schedule_. At least three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent a schedule (the "
**Securityholder Payment Schedule** ") which sets forth (i) the calculation of
the Per Share Stockholder Closing Payment, Per Share Stockholder Merger
Consideration and Optionholder Merger Consideration based on the Estimated
Closing Statement, (ii) each Company SecurityholderÂ’s applicable Closing
Stockholder Payment and Optionholder Closing Payment, (iii) each Company
SecurityholderÂ’s portion of the Six-Month Payment and Twelve-Month Payment
and, assuming maximum achievement, each Earn-Out Payment, (iv) the holder of,
and the number of shares of Common Stock held by each Company Stockholder, as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (v) the holder of, the exercise
price per share of, and the number of shares of Common Stock subject to, each
Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (vi) each
Company SecurityholderÂ’s Pro Rata Share and corresponding portion of the
Litigation Escrow Amount, Indemnity Escrow Amount, Adjustment Escrow Amount
and Expense Fund; it being understood and agreed that Parent and its
Affiliates shall be entitled to rely exclusively on the Estimated Closing
Statement, the Securityholder Payment Schedule and any payment instructions
delivered by the Company (if

 



     

 

 



 

delivered prior to or at the Closing) or by the Stockholder Representative (if
delivered following the Closing), including the adjustments to the
consideration contemplated by _Section 2.8(c)_, without investigation in
paying all portions of the consideration payable pursuant to the this
Agreement on and after the Closing Date, including the Estimated Merger
Consideration and all Distributions, without liability of any kind to Parent,
Newco, Merger Sub II, the Surviving Corporation, the Ultimate Surviving
Corporation or their respective Affiliates. The Stockholder Representative
shall deliver to Parent an update to the Securityholder Payment Schedule in
connection with the payment (or release) of each Distribution following the
Closing Date based on the actual final amount of such Distribution as
determined in accordance with this Agreement. _Schedule 2.14(b)_ sets forth a
form of the Securityholder Payment Schedule.

 



 

(c) _Closing Statement_. No later than the 90th day following the Closing
Date, Parent will cause to be prepared and delivered to the Stockholder
Representative a statement containing a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company as of the Closing Date (without giving effect to the transactions
contemplated herein), and setting forth a calculation of the Cash, Closing
Date Indebtedness, Seller Expenses and the Closing Working Capital (the "
**Closing Statement** ") and a certificate of Parent executed by its chief
executive officer or its chief financial officer that the Closing Statement
was prepared in accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles.

 



 

(d) _Post-Closing Adjustment Payment_. The post-closing adjustment shall be an
amount equal to the Final Merger Consideration minus the Estimated Merger
Consideration (the " **Post-Closing Adjustment** "), as finally determined
pursuant to _Section 2.14(e)_, if applicable.

 



 

(i) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative number after the final
determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment (including any Review Period
and/or Resolution Period as may be required pursuant to _Section 2.14(e)_
below), then Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall, within three (3)
Business Days after the final determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment
(including any Review Period and/or Resolution Period as may be required
pursuant to _Section 2.14(e)_ below), instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute
the entire amount of funds contained in the Adjustment Escrow Account by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, as follows: (A) to Parent, the lesser
of the absolute value of the Post-Closing Adjustment and the entire amount of
funds contained in the Adjustment Escrow Account at such time, and (B) to the
Paying Agent, the remaining funds (if any) in the Adjustment Escrow Account
following the payment set forth in the preceding clause (A), which funds will
be distributed to the Company Securityholders.

 



 

(ii) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive number, then within three
(3) Business Days of the final determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment
(including any Review Period and/or Resolution Period as may be required
pursuant to _Section 2.14(e)_ below), (A) Parent will pay to the Paying Agent
an amount equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, and (B) Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall,
within three (3) Business Days after the final determination of the Post-
Closing Adjustment (including any Review Period and/or Resolution Period as
may be required pursuant to _Section 2.14(e)_ below), instruct the Escrow
Agent to distribute the entire amount of funds contained in the Adjustment
Escrow Account by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Paying
Agent. The amounts

 



     

 

 



 

in clauses (A) and (B) of the preceding sentence shall be added to the Payment
Fund to be distributed by the Paying Agent to the Company Securityholders.

 



 

(iii) Any payments made pursuant to this _Section 2.14(d)_ shall be treated
as an adjustment to the Final Merger Consideration by the parties for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

 



 

(e) _Examination and Review_.

 



 

(i) After receipt of the Closing Statement, the Stockholder Representative
shall have thirty (30) days (the " **Review Period** ") to review the Closing
Statement. During the Review Period, the Stockholder Representative and the
Stockholder RepresentativeÂ’s accountants shall have reasonable access, during
reasonable business hours and upon reasonable prior written notice, to the
personnel of Parent or the Ultimate Surviving Corporation to the extent they
were involved in the preparation of the Closing Statement and the books and
records of the Company to the extent that they relate to the Closing Statement
for the purpose of reviewing the Closing Statement.

 



 

(ii) On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, the Stockholder
Representative may object to the Closing Statement by delivering to Parent a
written statement setting forth the Stockholder RepresentativeÂ’s objections in
reasonable detail, indicating each disputed item or amount and the basis for
the Stockholder RepresentativeÂ’s disagreement therewith and including an
alternative calculation of the Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness, Seller
Expenses and/or the Closing Working Capital, as the case may be (the "
**Statement of Objections** "). If a Statement of Objections is delivered by
the Stockholder Representative pursuant to this _Section 2.14(e)(ii)_, the
Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and
amounts set forth in the Closing Statement which are not specified as disputed
in such Statement of Objections and all such items and amounts, together with
any Undisputed Amounts, shall be deemed to be final and binding on the parties
to this Agreement. If the Stockholder Representative fails to deliver the
Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, the
Closing Statement and the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be,
reflected in the Closing Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by
the Stockholder Representative. If the Stockholder Representative delivers the
Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, Parent and
the Stockholder Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
objections within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Statement of
Objections (the " **Resolution Period** "), and, if the same are so resolved
within the Resolution Period, the Post-Closing Adjustment and the Closing
Statement with such changes as may have been previously agreed in writing by
Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall be final and binding.

 



 

(iii) If the Stockholder Representative and Parent fail to reach an agreement
with respect to all of the matters set forth in the Statement of Objections
before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any amounts remaining in
dispute (" **Disputed Amounts** " and any amounts not so disputed, the "
**Undisputed Amounts** ") shall be submitted for resolution to an impartial
nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants
appointed by mutual agreement of Parent and the Stockholder

 



     

 

 



 

Representative (the " **Independent Accountants** ") who, acting as experts
and not arbitrators, shall resolve the Disputed Amounts only and make any
adjustments to the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, and the
Closing Statement, in each case, as required to comply with the provisions of
this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that all adjustments shall be made
without regard to materiality. The Independent Accountants shall only decide
the specific items under dispute by the parties, based solely on presentations
by Parent and the Stockholder Representative and not by independent review and
in a manner consistent with this _Section 2.14_ and the Agreed Accounting
Principles, and their decision for each Disputed Amount must be within the
range of values assigned to each such item in the Closing Statement and the
Statement of Objections, respectively. Parent and the Stockholder
Representative will use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Independent Accountants to issue their written determination regarding the
Disputed Amounts within thirty (30) days after such items are submitted for
review. The determination of the Independent Accountants will be final,
binding and conclusive upon the parties hereto absent manifest error, and
Parent will revise the Closing Statement to reflect such determination upon
receipt thereof.

 



 

(iv) All fees and expenses relating to the engagement of the Independent
Accountants shall be allocated between the Stockholder Representative and
Parent so that (i) the Stockholder RepresentativeÂ’s share of such fees and
expenses (which shall be paid by the Stockholder Representative out of the
Expense Fund) shall be equal to the product of (A) the aggregate amount of
such fees and expenses, multiplied by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which
is the aggregate Disputed Amounts ultimately unsuccessfully disputed by the
Stockholder Representative (as determined by the Independent Accountants), and
the denominator of which is the aggregate Disputed Amounts, and (ii) Parent
shall pay the balance of such fees and expenses. For example, if the
Stockholder Representative challenges the calculation of the Closing Working
Capital by $100,000, but the Independent Accountants determines that the
Stockholder Representative has a valid claim for only $30,000, the Stockholder
Representative will bear 70% of the fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountants and Parent will bear the other 30% of such fees and expenses.

 



 

 **Section 2.15** **_Post-Closing Merger Consideration Payments_.**

 



 

(a) _Six-Month Payment_. On the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date,
Parent shall pay to the Company Securityholders an aggregate amount equal to
$12,500,000 (the " **Six-Month Payment** ") in cash, which shall be delivered
by Parent as follows: (i) to the Paying Agent (on behalf of the Company
Stockholders), the Company StockholdersÂ’ aggregate Pro Rata Share of such
amount; and (ii) to the Ultimate Surviving Corporation (on behalf of the
holders of Options), such holdersÂ’ aggregate Pro Rata Share of such amount,
and the Ultimate Surviving Corporation shall promptly pay to each holder of
Options its Pro Rata Share of such amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
the case of payments to employees or former employees of any Acquired Company
for which employment Tax withholding is required, such amounts shall be paid
through the Ultimate Surviving CorporationÂ’s (or its AffiliateÂ’s) payroll
processing service or system, in each case in accordance with _Section
2.14(b)_.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) _Twelve-Month Payment_. On the twelve (12) month anniversary of the
Closing Date, Parent shall pay to the Company Securityholders an aggregate
amount equal to $12,500,000 (the " **Twelve-Month Payment** ") in cash, which
shall be delivered by Parent as follows: (i) to the Paying Agent (on behalf of
the Company Stockholders), the Company StockholdersÂ’ aggregate Pro Rata Share
of such amount; and (ii) to the Ultimate Surviving Corporation (on behalf of
the holders of Options), such holdersÂ’ aggregate Pro Rata Share of such
amount, and the Ultimate Surviving Corporation shall promptly pay to each
holder of Options its Pro Rata Share of such amount; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the case of payments to employees or former employees of any Acquired
Company for which employment Tax withholding is required, such amounts shall
be paid through the Ultimate Surviving CorporationÂ’s (or its AffiliateÂ’s)
payroll processing service or system, in each case in accordance with _Section
2.14(b)_.

 



 

(c) _Earn-Outs_.

 



 

(i) The Company Securityholders shall be entitled to two earn-out payments
from Parent based on the growth of Company Revenue over two successive three-
year periods immediately following the Earn-Out Start Date (as defined below)
(such three-year periods the " **First Earn-Out Period** " and the " **Second
Earn-Out Period** ", respectively, and collectively the " **Earn-Out Periods**
"). The First Earn-Out Period shall commence on the Closing Date, and end on
the last day (the " **First End Date** ") of the thirty-sixth month following
the Closing Date. The Second Earn-Out Period shall commence on the first day
of the thirty-seventh month following the Closing Date, and end on the last
day of the seventy-second month following the Closing Date (the " **Second End
Date** ", and together with the First End Date, the " **End Dates** "). As
used herein, " **Earn-Out Start Date** " means (1) the Closing Date, if the
Closing Date is the first calendar day of a calendar month, or (2) the first
calendar day of the first full calendar month immediately following the
Closing Date, if the Closing Date is not on the first calendar day of a
calendar month.

 



 

(ii) The aggregate earn-out payment associated with the First Earn-Out Period
(the " **First Earn-Out Payment** "), and the aggregate earn-out payment
associated with the Second Earn-Out Period (the " **Second Earn-Out Payment**
", and together with the First Earn-Out Payment, the " **Earn-Out Payments**
") shall each be payable by Parent to the Company Securityholders after the
applicable End Date in accordance with the following procedure and _Section
2.14(b)_. Within sixty (60) days after the applicable End Date, Parent shall
deliver to the Stockholder Representative its calculation of the applicable
Earn-Out Payment (the " **Calculated Payout** "). The Stockholder
Representative shall have the right to dispute in writing the Calculated
Payout within sixty (60) days following receipt of the calculation of the
Calculated Payout (such 60-day period, the " **Notice Period** "). If Parent
does not receive a notice of such a dispute within the Notice Period, the
Calculated Payout shall be paid to the Company Securityholders no later than
five (5) Business Days after the end of the Notice Period. If Parent receives
a notice of such a dispute within the Notice Period, then Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall, for an additional thirty (30) days following
ParentÂ’s receipt of such notice of dispute (such additional 30-day period, the
" **Resolution Period** "), attempt to reach agreement on the Calculated
Payout. If no resolution of this dispute is finalized within the Resolution
Period, undisputed amounts shall be paid to the Company Securityholders and
only the disputed items or amounts shall be submitted for review and final
determination by the Independent

 



     

 

 



 

Accountants. The Independent Accountants shall review all relevant data,
including any necessary books and records of Parent, to determine the changes
to the Calculated Payout, if any, necessary to resolve only the disputed items
or amounts. The determination by the Independent Accountants shall be made as
promptly as practical, but in no event, beyond thirty (30) days, and shall be
final and binding on the parties hereto. In the event that the final Earn-Out
Payment is equal to or less than the Calculated Payout, the costs of the
Independent Accountants shall be borne by the Stockholder Representative (on
behalf of the Company Securityholders). In the event that the final Earn-Out
Payment is greater than the Calculated Payout, the costs of the Independent
Accountants shall be borne by Parent. Upon such final determination, Parent
shall pay to the Company Securityholders within ten (10) Business Days any
additional amount of the finally determined Earn-Out Payment. The applicable
portion of each Earn-Out Payment shall be paid to the Company Stockholders as
follows: (i) to the Paying Agent (on behalf of the Company Stockholders), the
Company StockholdersÂ’ aggregate Pro Rata Share of such amount, and (ii) to the
Ultimate Surviving Corporation (on behalf of the holders of Options), such
holdersÂ’ aggregate Pro Rata Share of such amount, and the Ultimate Surviving
Corporation shall promptly pay to each holder of Options its Pro Rata Share of
such amount; _provided_ that in the case of payments to employees or former
employees of any Acquired Company for which employment Tax withholding is
required, such amounts shall be paid through the Ultimate Surviving
CorporationÂ’s (or its AffiliateÂ’s) payroll processing service or system, in
each case in accordance with _Section 2.14(b)_.

 



 

(iii) On the date on which the relevant Earn-Out Payment becomes due and
payable hereunder (the " **Earn-Out Payment Date** "), the portion of the
Second Earn-Out Payment that is in excess of a cumulative amount of
$55,000,000 (as calculated by including the aggregate amount of the First
Earn-Out Payment, if any) shall be payable to those Company Securityholders
who received Focus Stock at Closing pursuant to _Section 2.8(b)_ in such
aggregate number of shares of Focus Stock equal to such excess amount _divided
by_ the applicable Earn-Out Value; _provided_ , however, that in the event any
restrictions exist relating to any pending registrations or filings on the
relevant Earn-Out Payment Date then the Focus Stock shall be delivered
following the expiration of such restrictions; _provided_ , _further_ , that
if such restrictions extend beyond ninety (90) days after the Earn-Out Payment
Date, then such excess amount shall be paid in cash rather than Focus Stock.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Focus Stock is not admitted to trading and
quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market or other national stock exchange on
an Earn-Out Payment Date, then the relevant Earn-Out Payment shall be payable
entirely in cash. Any Focus Stock required to be issued under this paragraph
shall be evidenced by book-entry(ies) which shall bear any such restrictive
legends as may be required by Parent or otherwise under any applicable law,
rule or regulation, but no more restrictive than those set forth on the book-
entry(ies) of other similarly situated holders of Focus Stock. If a fraction
of a share of Focus Stock would otherwise be issuable pursuant to this
_Section 2.15(c)(iii)_, such fraction shall be rounded up or down to the
nearest whole number (i.e., up to one whole share of Focus Stock or down to
zero), and the cash portion of the Earn-Out Payment shall be adjusted
accordingly.

 



 

(iv) The First Earn-Out Payment shall be an amount set forth opposite the
corresponding First Period Growth Rate (as defined below) for the First Earn-

 



     

 

 



 

Out Period in Table 2.15 below. The " **First Period Growth Rate** " shall be
the fraction, expressed as a percentage, derived from the following formula:

 



 

 **[** (((Company Revenue yr3) / ($57,500,000))^(1/3))-1 **]**

 



 

(v) The Second Earn-Out Payment shall be an amount set forth opposite the
corresponding Second Period Growth Rate (as defined below) for the Second
Earn-Out Period in Table 2.15 below. The " **Second** **Period Growth Rate** "
shall be the fraction, expressed as a percentage, derived from the following
formula:

 



 

 **[** (((Company Revenue yr6) / (greater of $57,500,000 
or Company Revenue yr3))^(1/3))-1 **]**

(vi) For the avoidance of doubt, (A) no employment or management services by
any Company Securityholder is required to earn such Company SecurityholderÂ’s
pro rata share of any of the Earn-Out Payments and (B) in no event shall
Parent be obligated to pay Earn-Out Payments in excess of $70,000,000 in the

ParentÂ’s independent auditors, generated from (1) the existing client
relationships of the Acquired Companies (other than The Wealth Management
Alliance LLC) as of the Closing, (2) new clients sourced and serviced solely
by the Loring Ward business line of BAM, Buckingham Strategic Wealth and/or

 **Business Line** "), that sign investment advisory agreements with Parent or
Subsidiaries of Parent from and after the Closing, (3) existing client
relationships of LWI (i.e., the Acquired CompaniesÂ’ turnkey asset management

such revenue from existing client relationships of LWI as of the Closing who

doubt, that "Company Revenue" shall not include any revenues from any
subsequent add-on acquisitions by the LW Business Line (i.e., any asset
acquisitions, mergers or similar transactions following the Closing Date
between Parent or its Subsidiaries (or any special-purpose entity which merges
with and into Parent or its Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and a third party,
on the other, under which Parent or its Subsidiaries (or such special-purpose
entity) acquires client relationships (including by the assignment of client
contracts) from such third party in exchange for purchase price
consideration).

Except as set forth in (i) the corresponding section of the disclosure
schedule delivered by the Company to Parent and Newco concurrent with the

Schedule, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Newco as
follows:

 



 

 **Section 3.1** **_Organization and Qualification._**

equivalent) power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted in all material
respects.

 



 

(b) The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated
by it, or the nature of the business conducted by it, makes such qualification
or licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be
so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) The Company has made available to Parent and Newco a true and complete
copy of the Organizational Documents of each Acquired Company (collectively,
the " **Company Charter Documents** "), in each case, including all amendments
thereto. The Company Charter Documents are in full force and effect.

 



 

 **Section 3.2** **_Capitalization of the Company; Subsidiaries._**

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 2,100,000 shares
of Common Stock, of which 916,000 shares are issued and outstanding, all of
which are

 



     

 

 



 

voting Common Stock and Book-Entry Shares. All of such outstanding shares of
the Company have been duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and are
nonassessable and have been issued in compliance with all applicable
Securities Laws. All outstanding shares of Common Stock are held of record by
the Persons and in the amounts as set forth in _Schedule 3.2(a)_ , and are not
subject to, or issued in violation of, any purchase option, call option, right
of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right,

Company Charter Documents, or any Contract to which the Company is a party.

Acquired Companies, taken as a whole. Each of the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries has
the requisite corporate (or equivalent) power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and carry on its business as presently conducted,
except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of
the Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated
by it, or the nature of the business conducted by it, makes such qualification

exchangeable for equity securities of such Subsidiary, or (v) stock
appreciation, phantom stock, profit participation or similar rights with
respect to such Subsidiary. Loring Ward International Limited and SNCB002 Inc.

consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby other than Company
Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company and constitutes a valid, legal and binding agreement of the

will (A) conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of the
CompanyÂ’s Charter Documents, (B) except as set forth on _Schedule 3.4_,
result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice
or lapse of time or both) a default, or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration, under any of the terms, conditions or provisions
of any Material Contract, or (C) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree,
Permit or Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective properties or assets, except, in the case of clauses (A) and

reasonably be expected to be material to the Acquired Companies, taken as a
whole.

additional information, financial statements, sales literature, statements,
notices and other material filings required to be filed by it with any
Governmental Entity, including all material amendments or supplements to any

present in all material respects the financial position, statement of net

Acquired Companies; _provided_ that such access shall be in a manner that does
not materially interfere with the normal business operations of any Acquired
Company. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) no such access
shall be permitted to the extent that it would require any Acquired Company to
disclose information subject to attorney-client or similar privilege (
_provided_ that the Company shall request, but shall not be required to
obtain, a waiver of any such confidentiality obligations upon ParentÂ’s
reasonable prior written request; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the

disclose such information as nearly as possible without affecting attorney-
client privilege), (ii) no such access shall be permitted to the extent that
it would be in violation of applicable Law, (iii) neither Parent nor its
representatives shall contact any suppliers to, or customers of, the Acquired
Companies regarding the Acquired Companies or the transactions contemplated

successors) and other written information with respect to the Acquired
Companies (or their successors) as the Stockholder Representative may
reasonably request from time to time, in each case to the extent reasonably
required for Tax purposes or to defend a Proceeding; _provided_ that no such
access shall be granted in connection with any dispute relating to this
Agreement or Merger Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby or
otherwise among the parties, Company Securityholders or their Affiliates.
Parent shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, preserve and keep all
material books and records of the Acquired Companies relating to the period

 **Section 5.3** **_No Solicitation_**. During the period from the date
hereof through the earlier of the Closing Date and the termination of this
Agreement, the Company and its Affiliates will not, and will not authorize or
permit any of its directors, officers, employees, members, managers, partners
or stockholders to and will direct its agents, representatives and other
advisors not to, directly or indirectly, (i) take any action to initiate,
solicit, knowingly encourage, negotiate or accept any proposal or offer from
any person or entity with respect to, (ii) continue or participate in
negotiations or discussions regarding, (iii) provide any material non-public
information to any person or entity for the purpose of making any proposal
regarding or (iv) reach or enter into any agreement or understanding for, or
otherwise attempt to consummate, any Takeover Proposal. If the Company
(including its representatives) receives any offer, proposal or inquiry
regarding any Takeover Proposal after the date hereof and prior to the earlier
of the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall
immediately notify Parent thereof in writing, including the identity of the
party making such offer, proposal or inquiry and the material terms thereof
unless the Company is otherwise prohibited from doing so pursuant to any
contractual confidentiality obligations to the Person delivering such offer,
proposal or inquiry that are in effect as of the date hereof.

 



 

 **Section 5.4** **_Public Announcements_**. The timing and content of all
announcements regarding any aspect of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby to the general public shall be mutually agreed upon in
advance by the Company and Parent; _provided_ that, notwithstanding any
provision in the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, any party hereto
may make any such announcement which it in good faith believes is necessary in
connection with any requirement of Law, including as may be required to comply
with the rules and regulations of any stock exchange or national market system
upon which the securities of Parent are listed (it being understood and agreed
that the party required to make such press release or other public
announcement shall, to the extent reasonably practicable under the
circumstances, consult with the other party with respect to the timing and
content thereof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement the parties shall release the
mutually agreed press release in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_.

 



 

 **Section 5.5** **_Directors and Officers Liability; Indemnification_**.
Each of the Organizational Documents of the Ultimate Surviving Corporation and
the Organizational Documents of each of its Subsidiaries shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification and limitation of
liability than are set forth in the Charter Documents as of the date hereof,
which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six (6) years after the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of

 



     

 

 



 

individuals who at or prior to the Effective Time were directors, officers,
agents or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who were
otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to the Charter Documents
(collectively, " **Company Indemnitees** "). Any agreement providing for
indemnification by any Acquired Company or limitation of liability of any of
the Company Indemnitees in effect on the date of this Agreement shall survive
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms on no less
favorable terms and be honored by Parent and the Acquired Companies after the
Closing. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, all
indemnification rights of the Company Indemnitees described in this _Section
_ _5.5_ shall be mandatory rather than permissive, and Parent shall cause the
Acquired Companies to advance expenses in connection with such indemnification
as provided in the applicable governing documents or other applicable
agreements. Without the prior written consent of the applicable Company
Indemnitee (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent
and the Company shall not, and shall cause the other Acquired Companies not
to, settle any matter for which they are providing indemnification to such
Company Indemnitee, other than any settlement exclusively requiring the
payment of monetary damages to be paid entirely by or on behalf of the
indemnifying party and that includes as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the Person or Persons asserting such claim to such Company
Indemnitee of an unconditional release from all liability with respect to such
matter and that there is no finding or admission of liability with respect to
such Company Indemnitee. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall purchase a
fully prepaid insurance "tail" or other insurance policies (the " **Tail
Policy** ") with respect to directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance with
respect to acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the coverage
applicable to directors, officers, agents and employees as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time under the CompanyÂ’s directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’
liability insurance policy ( _provided_ , for avoidance of doubt, that fifty
percent (50%) of the costs and expenses in obtaining the Tail Policy shall be
a Seller Expense hereunder). The Ultimate Surviving Corporation shall maintain
in effect such Tail Policy for six (6) years after the Effective Time. From
and after the Closing, the Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Company
to, timely submit any and all claims that may be covered by the Tail Policy.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any litigation, dispute or
proceeding (whether arising before, at or after the Closing) is made against
any Person covered by the Tail Policy on or prior to the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Closing, the provisions of this _Section 5.5_ shall
continue in effect until the final disposition of such litigation, dispute or
proceeding. In the event that the Company or Parent or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successor, assign or acquirer of the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.5_. The obligations of Parent under this _Section
5.5_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any Company Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.5_ applies without the
express written consent of such affected Company Indemnitee (it being
expressly agreed that the Company Indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.5_
applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.5_). Parent
shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees, that
may be incurred by any Company Indemnitee in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this _Section 5.5_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, this _Section 5.5_ will not affect any rights or remedies otherwise
available to the Parent Covered Parties, including pursuant to _Article
VIII_.

 



     

 

 



 

 **Section 5.6** **_Newco; Obligations of Parent_**. Parent will take all
action necessary (a) to cause Newco to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement and (b) to ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Newco
shall not conduct any business or make any investments other than as
specifically contemplated by this Agreement and will not have any assets
(other than a _de minimis_ amount of cash paid to Newco for the issuance of
its stock to Parent). Whenever this Agreement requires Newco or the Ultimate
Surviving Corporation to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Newco or the Ultimate
Surviving Corporation to take such action and a guarantee of performance
thereof.

 



 

 **Section 5.7** **_Information Statement_**. Promptly following the date
hereof, the Company shall prepare an information statement accurately
describing this Agreement, the Merger and the provisions of DGCL Section 262
(the " **Information Statement** ") and reflecting any reasonable comments of
Parent, and deliver such Information Statement to those Company Stockholders
who did not execute the Written Consent in respect of the Merger for the
purpose of informing such Company Stockholders of the approval of the Merger,
the adoption of this Agreement and the appraisal rights available under the
DGCL.

 



 

 **Section 5.8** **_Further Action; Governmental Authorizations;
Approvals_.**

 



 

(a) Each of the parties shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Laws or otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, including using its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Governmental Authorizations and
other consents or approvals of parties to agreements or contracts with the
Acquired Companies or Parent as are necessary for the transactions
contemplated herein. Each of Parent and Newco, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, shall cooperate, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to cooperate, with all reasonable requests of the Company or Parent
and Newco, as applicable, in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all such
action. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (x) nothing herein
shall obligate or be construed to obligate the Company to make, or to cause to
be made, any payment to any third party in order to obtain the consent or
approval of such third party under any Material Contract and (y) the
obligations of the parties under this _Section 5.8(a)_ shall be subject to
the remainder of this _Section 5.8_. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing: (i) the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause Loring
Ward Securities Inc. (the " **BD Subsidiary** ") to, as promptly as
practicable following the date hereof, make a full withdrawal of its broker-
dealer registration with FINRA, all other self-regulatory organizations, the
SEC and any states in which the BD Subsidiary is registered by as a broker-
dealer; (ii) in furtherance of the foregoing, the Company shall cause the BD
Subsidiary to file Form BDW through FINRAÂ’s WebCRD facility by no later than
October 30, 2018 (the " **Filing Date** ") (provided that the Filing Date
shall automatically be extended by ten (10) Business Days if the Company has
not caused the BD Subsidiary to file Form BDW as of October 30, 2018 but is
using reasonable best efforts to do so), and to provide such other documents
and instruments with WebCRD and other federal and state agencies and self-
regulatory organizations as may be required

 



     

 

 



 

to effect such a full withdrawal as promptly as practicable following the date
hereof; and (iii) the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
BD Subsidiary, following acceptance of any and all such withdrawals, to
liquidate and dissolve as promptly as practicable following the date hereof
(the " **BD Sub Withdrawal and Liquidation** "); _provided_ that, in lieu of
the BD Sub Withdrawal and Liquidation, upon written notice to Parent, and if
and only if the BD Sub Withdrawal and Liquidation would not reasonably be
expected to be completed prior to November 30, 2018 despite the CompanyÂ’s
reasonable best efforts in accordance with the foregoing, the Company may
instead, prior to Closing, (x) cause all of its registrations as broker-
dealer, commodity trading adviser, commodity pool operator, futures commission
merchant or swap dealer to be amended, effective upon the Merger, to reflect
the change of control and other matters to be effectuated hereby and (y)
receive the approval of such amended registrations by FINRA and all other
state, federal and self-regulatory bodies necessary to made such amended
registrations fully effective (the " **BD Sub Amendment** "). Parent shall
reasonably cooperate with the Company in the consummation of the BD Sub
Withdrawal and Liquidation and the completion of the BD Sub Amendment,
including using commercially reasonable efforts to provide any applicable
information about Parent and its Affiliates.

 



 

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each of the
parties shall promptly notify the other in writing of any pending or, to the
Knowledge of such party, threatened action, proceeding or investigation by any
Governmental Entity or any other Person (i) challenging or seeking damages in
connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, or (ii) seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation
of the Merger or otherwise limit the right of Parent to own or operate all or
any portion of the business or assets of the Company.

 



 

(c) In connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (i)
the parties shall cooperate to file or cause to be filed as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, with the United States Federal Trade
Commission, the United States Department of Justice and any other applicable
U.S. Governmental Entity all notification and report forms that may be
required for the transactions contemplated hereby and thereafter provide as
promptly as practicable any supplemental information requested in connection
therewith pursuant to the HSR Act, and all filing fees payable under the HSR
Act shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Parent and fifty percent (50%) by
the Company, and (ii) as expeditiously as possible after the date hereof, the
parties will make or cause to be made all filings and submissions required
under other Laws of Governmental Entities required for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein, including without limitation all others
filings or submissions required under Competition/Investment Law outside the
United States. The parties agree to seek early termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act.

 



 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment and any proceeding instituted or
threatened by a Governmental Entity or private party under the HSR Act or any
other Competition/Investment Law that is asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Merger Document so as to
enable the consummation of such transactions to occur as expeditiously as
possible and, in any event, by the Termination Date; provided that (x) neither
Parent, Newco nor any of their respective Affiliates shall be required to: (i)
sell, divest or dispose of any of their respective businesses, assets, equity

 



      

 

 



 

interests in any Person, product lines or properties or any interest in any
joint venture held by such party or any of such partyÂ’s Affiliates; (ii)
terminate or divest relationships, ventures, contractual rights or
obligations; or (iii) otherwise take or commit to take any action that would
limit such partyÂ’s or such partyÂ’s AffiliatesÂ’ freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any of its
respective businesses, assets, equity interests in any Person, product lines
or properties or any interest in any joint venture held by such party or such
partyÂ’s Affiliates and (y) neither the Company or any of its Affiliates shall
be required to: (i) sell, divest or dispose of any of their respective
businesses, assets, equity interests in any Person, product lines or
properties or any interest in any joint venture held by such party or any of
such partyÂ’s Affiliates or (ii) terminate or divest relationships, ventures,
contractual rights or obligations, in each case, which would have a material
adverse effect on the anticipated value to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Subject to applicable Law, no party shall (i) agree to extend any waiting
period under the HSR Act or other Competition/Investment Law without the prior
written consent of the other parties (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); or (ii) enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Entity not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Merger Document without the prior written consent of the
other parties (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned of
delayed).

 



 

(f) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent
and the Company shall provide the other party and its advisors or, if required
or advisable under applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
only to such other partyÂ’s outside counsel on an "attorneys-eyes only" basis,
with a reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult the other on, all the information relating to
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Affiliates, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the Company and Parent shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

 



 

(g) The Company and Parent each shall keep the other reasonably apprised of
the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including furnishing the other as promptly as reasonably practicable
with copies of notice or other material communications received by Parent or
the Company, as the case may be, or any of their respective Affiliates, from
any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company and
Parent shall, if practicable, and to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity, give the other party prior written notice of any meeting of any of its
officers, employees or any other representatives or agents with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry
relating to the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Optionholder Letters prior to Closing.

 



     

 

 



 

 **Section 5.9** **_Client Consents and Regulated Fund Matters_.**

 



 

(a) Except for the Regulated Fund Investment Services Contracts discussed in
_Section 5.9(b)_ below, with respect to each Investment Services Contract and
each Indirect Client Contract, the Company shall, and shall cause each Adviser
Subsidiary to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, in
accordance with applicable Law and the applicable Investment Services Contract
or Indirect Client Contract, the consent, to the extent required by applicable
Law and such Investment Services Contract or Indirect Client Contract, of each
Advisor, each Direct Client and each Indirect Client, as applicable, to the
assignment or deemed assignment resulting from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Parent shall not take any intentional action to prevent or
delay the CompanyÂ’s efforts to obtain such consents. For purposes of this
_Section 5.8(a)_, consent may also include the written agreement by each
Advisor, each Direct Client or each Indirect Client, as applicable, to a new
Contract pursuant to which a Subsidiary of the Parent agrees to provide
Investment Services effective upon Closing. Notwithstanding the generality of
the foregoing, the Company and Parent have agreed to a form of notice set
forth on _Exhibit F_ hereto that the applicable Adviser Subsidiary will send,
substantially in that form (the " **Notice** "), to each Advisor, each Direct
Client and each Indirect Client, respectively; and in each case, as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement. The Company and Parent agree
that the consent by the recipient of an applicable Notice to the assignment or
deemed assignment resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
deemed given for any and all purposes under this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and the relevant agreement if the consent
requested in such notice has been provided in writing by the Advisor, Direct
Client or Indirect Client, as required and as the case may be, provided
however that in respect of each Negative Consent Eligible Contract, such
consent shall be deemed given as a result of receipt (within the CompanyÂ’s
reasonable belief) of the applicable Notice unless the recipient, prior to
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, has affirmatively stated in
writing to the relevant Subsidiary that such recipient does not so consent
(but then only to the extent that such recipient has a contractual right to
withhold its consent) or shall have otherwise provided a notice of termination
of the relevant agreement under which Investment Services are provided,
_provided further_ that the Notice to such recipient under this _Section
5.9(a)_ is duly given in a manner specified in the relevant agreement and at
least 45 days shall have elapsed from the date of such notice until the
Closing Date.

 



 

(b) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, cause LWI to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
requisite approval by: (i) the Regulated Trust Board of new Regulated Fund
Investment Services Contracts for each of the Regulated Funds (including
Regulated Fund Investment Services Contracts to which a sub-adviser is a
party); (ii) the Regulated Trust Board of interim Regulated Fund Investment
Services Contracts for each of the Regulated Funds pursuant to Rule 15a-4
under the Investment Company Act (the " **Interim Agreements** "); (iii) the
shareholders of each of the Regulated Funds of the new Regulated Fund
Investment Services Contract for such Regulated Fund, each as required by and
in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Company Act, to be
effective on the date of such shareholder approval and such new Regulated Fund
Investment Services Contracts and Interim Agreements (except for the
additional provisions required by Rule 15a-4 under the Investment Company Act)
shall be on substantially the same terms and conditions as in effect on the
date of this Agreement; and (iv) the Regulated Trust Board of the proxy
statement and proxy (together, the " **Proxy Materials** ") substantially in
the form to be used to solicit requisite shareholder approval of the new

 



     

 

 



 

Regulated Fund Investment Services Contracts, which Proxy Materials shall
include a recommendation by the Regulated Trust Board that shareholders of
each Regulated Fund approve its applicable new Regulated Fund Investment
Services Contract. The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, cause LWI to use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any Person serving as a subadviser to a Regulated Fund (as of the date
hereof) (such subadvised Regulated Funds, the " **Subadvised Funds** ") to
consent, to the extent required by the applicable Contract, to the assignment
of such Contract resulting from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " **Subadvisory Consent** ").

 



 

(c) The Company and Parent shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate in preparing, and obtaining approval of the Regulated Trust Board of
all proxy solicitation materials (and any amendment or supplement thereto)
required to be distributed to shareholders of the Regulated Funds with respect
to the actions recommended for shareholder approval by the Regulated Trust
Board. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
solicitation materials to be filed with the SEC and any other appropriate
Governmental Entities and to obtain effectiveness of such filings or any
required SEC or other required approvals by Governmental Entities. The Company
shall mail (or cause to be mailed) such proxy solicitation materials to
shareholders of the Regulated Funds as promptly as reasonably practicable
after clearance thereof by the SEC (if applicable) or, if no such clearance is
required, after the expiration of any required waiting or filing period.

 



 

(d) The Company agrees that the information provided by it or its Affiliates
(or on their behalf) in writing specifically for inclusion in the proxy
solicitation materials relating to the new Regulated Fund Investment Services
Contracts will not contain, as of the date of such proxy solicitation
materials, any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Parent agrees that the information provided by it and its
Affiliates (or on their behalf) in writing specifically for inclusion in the
proxy solicitation materials relating to the new Regulated Fund Investment
Services Contracts will not contain, as of the date of such proxy solicitation
materials, any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Each of the Company and Parent shall have the right to review
in advance and comment on (which comments shall be considered by the other
party in good faith) any proxy solicitation materials or any amendment or
supplement thereto submitted to the SEC or other applicable Governmental
Entity in connection with the approvals contemplated by this _Section 5.9_
relating to the Regulated Funds, as well as any other materials sent or made
available to the shareholders of any Regulated Fund in connection with such
approvals.

 



 

(e) Parent and the Company shall each bear responsibility for fifty percent
(50%) of all expenses related to the solicitations pursuant to _Section
5.9(c)_, including the preparation, printing and mailing of proxy solicitation
materials, and other actions related to obtaining the solicitations.

 



 

(f) A Regulated Fund shall be deemed to have consented for all purposes under
this Agreement to the transactions contemplated hereby if the new Regulated
Fund Investment

 



     

 

 



 

Services Contract as contemplated by _Section 5.9(b)_ has been approved by
the Regulated Trust Board and the shareholders of such Regulated Fund.

 



 

(g) As promptly as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Regulated Fund engaged
in a public offering of its shares to (i) file supplements or amendments to
its prospectus forming a part of its registration statement then currently in
use, which supplements or amendments shall disclose the transactions
contemplated hereby to the extent required by applicable Laws, and (ii) make
any other filing necessary under any applicable Laws to satisfy in all
material respects disclosure requirements in connection with the public
distribution of the shares of that Regulated Fund. Parent shall have the right
to review in advance and comment on (which comments shall be considered by the
Company in good faith) the foregoing filings.

 



 

(h) In connection with the proxy solicitation materials and other filings
mentioned in this _Section 5.9_, each party shall provide such information to
the other parties and/or the applicable Regulated Fund as is reasonably
requested by any of them and is necessary to satisfy the requirements of all

or Parent and any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Continuing
Employee, on the

 



     

 

 



 

other hand, or (ii) as otherwise required by applicable Law, during the period

Companies to, (i) provide coverage for Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents under its or their medical, dental and health plans without
interruption of coverage; (ii) cause there to be waived any pre-existing
condition, actively at work requirements and waiting periods; and (iii) cause
the Parent Plans to honor any expenses incurred by the Continuing Employees

(b) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.11_, express or implied, is intended
to confer upon any Person, including any current or former employee of any

employment for any period or continued receipt of any specific employee
benefit, any status as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement with the

amend or modify) any Parent Plan or Employee Plan. Furthermore, nothing
contained herein shall (i) change the status of the Continuing Employees as
at-will employees (to the extent they are at-will employees immediately prior
to the Closing) or (ii) prevent Parent, its Affiliates or the Acquired
Companies from terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee or any

 **Section 5.12** **_Section 15(f)_.**

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and Newco acknowledges that the Company is entering into
this Agreement in reliance upon the benefits and protections provided by
Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act and that the Company Stockholders
will be relying on the same benefits and protections in approving the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and Newco shall seek to, to the
extent within their reasonable control, ensure compliance with Section 15(f)
of the Investment Company Act and all of its conditions as they apply in
respect of the Regulated Funds to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement so as to assure that the benefits and protections of Section 15(f)
of the Investment Company Act extend to the Company and its Affiliates. For
the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Newco shall use their best efforts to cause
their Affiliates to comply with the provisions Section 15(f) of the Investment
Company Act in relation to the Company. In that regard, subject to compliance
with its fiduciary duties, each of Parent and

 



     

 

 



 

Newco shall conduct its business and shall, to the extent within their
reasonable control, cause each of their respective Affiliates to conduct their
respective businesses so as to assure that:

2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act) of the investment adviser of such
Regulated Fund immediately prior to the Closing; and

 



 

(ii) for a period of two (2) years after the Closing, there shall not be
imposed on any Regulated Fund an "unfair burden" (as set forth and described
in Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act) as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any express or implied terms,
conditions or understandings applicable thereto.

 



 

(b) For a period of three (3) years from the Closing, each of Parent and Newco
shall not engage, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to engage,
in any transaction that would constitute an "assignment" (as defined in the
Investment Company Act) of any Regulated Fund Investment Services Contract
between (i) either (A) Parent, Newco or any of their respective Affiliates, or
(B) the Company and (ii) any Regulated Fund without first obtaining a
covenant, for the benefit of the Company, Regulated Funds and Company
Stockholders, in all material respects the same as that contained in this
_Section 5.12_.

 



 

 **Section 5.13** **_2018 Interim Financial Statements_**. The Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to (a) by no later than October 31, 2018, deliver

comparative basis as compared to the unaudited consolidated balance sheet and
the related statements of operations and cash flow of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2017, in draft
form, as reviewed by KPMG LLP, and (b) thereafter, and prior to the Closing
Date (but after giving Parent an opportunity to review and discuss with the
Company the deliverables under the foregoing clause (a)), deliver to Parent a
copy of the final unaudited consolidated balance sheet and the related
statements of operations and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries
for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2018, on a comparative basis as
compared to the unaudited consolidated balance sheet and the related
statements of operations and cash flow of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
the nine-month period ending September 30, 2017, as reviewed by KPMG LLP (the
financial statements under the foregoing clause (b), the " **2018 Interim
Financial Statements** "). The costs of KPMG LLPÂ’s review of the 2018 Interim
Financial Statements shall be borne by Parent.

 



 

 **Section 5.14** **_Return of Company Information_**. The Company shall, or
shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, request the return or destruction of
any information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
business that had been previously furnished to any Person (other than Parent,
its Affiliates or their respective representatives) for purposes of evaluating
a potential transaction with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries or
their business to the extent such return or destruction is contractually
required.

 



     

 

 



 

 **Section 5.15** **_Further Assurances_**. From and after the Closing, upon
reasonable request of the Stockholder Representative, on the one hand, or
Parent, on the other hand, the other party or parties shall, at its or their

appropriate to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

 **Section 5.16** **_Tax Matters_**.

 



 

(a) _Intended Tax Treatment_. Each of Parent and the Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Integrated Mergers, taken together, to
qualify, and will not take or knowingly fail to take (and will cause its
Subsidiaries not to take or knowingly fail to take) any action that could
reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Integrated Mergers, taken
together, from qualifying, as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code (the " **Intended Tax Treatment** "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no party shall be required to alter the amount, nature, or
mixture of consideration payable, or to be received, pursuant to _Article
II_. For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and for purposes of any applicable
state or local Tax that follows the U.S. federal income tax treatment), the
parties will prepare and file all Tax Returns consistent with the Intended Tax
Treatment and will not take any inconsistent position on any Tax Return, or
during the course of any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes, except as otherwise required by applicable Laws following a final
determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or good-faith
administrative settlement with (or final administrative decision by) the
relevant Governmental Entity.

 



 

(b) _Proration of Straddle Period Taxes_. For purposes of determining the
portion of any Taxes that are payable with respect to any Straddle Period that
are Pre-Closing Taxes, the portion of any such Taxes that is attributable to
the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be:

 



 

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income
or receipts, or (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the Tax period of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (and each partnership in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries is a partner) ended with (and included) the Closing Date;
provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be
allocated between the period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in
each period; and

 



 

(ii) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets or capital of the Company or any Subsidiary, deemed to be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such
Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on and
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire period.

 



 

(c) Parent, the Company, and the Stockholder Representative shall cooperate
fully as and to the extent reasonably requested by any other party in
connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns and any Tax
Proceeding. Such cooperation shall include the

 



     

 

 



 

retention and (upon any other partyÂ’s request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax
Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder.

 



 

(d) The Stockholder Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared all
Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries required to be filed after the
Closing Date for all Pre-Closing Periods. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared
on a basis consistent with past practice and _Section 5.16(f)_ except to the
extent otherwise required by applicable Law. Reasonably in advance of the due
date for filing any such Tax Return (which, in the case of income Tax Returns
shall be no later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such
Tax Return) the Stockholder Representative shall deliver or cause to be
delivered a draft of such Tax Return, together with all supporting
documentation and workpapers, to Parent for its review and reasonable comment.
Parent shall provide any comments on any Tax Return in writing to the
Stockholder Representative reasonably in advance of the due date for filing
the Tax Return (which, in the case of income Tax Returns shall be no later
than ten (10) days prior the due date for filing such Tax Return). If the
Stockholder Representative agrees in writing with ParentÂ’s comments, Parent
will cause such Tax Return (as revised to incorporate ParentÂ’s reasonable
comments that are agreed to in writing by the Stockholder Representative) to
be timely filed and will provide a copy thereof to the Stockholder
Representative. If the Stockholder Representative does not agree in writing
with ParentÂ’s comments, the parties will cooperate to resolve any disagreement
prior to the due date for filing the Tax Return. If the parties have not
resolved any disagreement prior to the due date, then (i) Parent will cause
such Tax Return (as drafted by the Stockholder Representative) to be timely
filed and will provide a copy thereof to the Stockholder Representative, (ii)
the parties shall resolve any disagreement through the procedures provided in
Section 2.14(e) and (iii) upon resolution of any disagreement, the parties
shall amend any Tax Return if necessary, and Parent shall file such amended
Tax Return and provide a copy to the Stockholder Representative. Parent will
(and will cause the Surviving Corporation to) cooperate with the Stockholder
Representative to enable the Stockholder Representative to utilize the
Surviving CorporationÂ’s existing tax return preparation firm(s) (the "
_Accounting Firm_ "). Such cooperation may include providing access to books
and records and accounting staff, and delegating authority to the Stockholder
Representative under the Accounting FirmÂ’s engagement agreement sufficient for
the Accounting Firm to take direction from the Stockholder Representative, or
otherwise ensuring that the Stockholder Representative will have access to
(and the ability to direct, even if indirectly through the Surviving
Corporation) the Accounting Firm.

 



 

(e) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all Straddle Periods. Such Tax Returns shall
be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Law. Reasonably in advance of the due date
for filing any such Tax Return (which, in the case of income Tax Returns shall
be no later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Return) Parent shall deliver a draft of such Tax Return, together with all
supporting documentation and workpapers, to the Stockholder Representative for
its review and reasonable comment. The Stockholder Representative shall
provide any comments on any Tax Return in writing to Parent reasonably in
advance of the due date for filing the Tax Return (which, in the case of
income Tax Returns shall be no later than ten (10) days prior the due date for
filing such Tax Return). If Parent agrees in writing with the Stockholder
RepresentativeÂ’s comments, Parent will cause such Tax

 



     

 

 



 

Return (as revised to incorporate the Stockholder RepresentativeÂ’s reasonable
comments) to be timely filed and will provide a copy thereof to the
Stockholder Representative. If Parent does not agree in writing with the
Stockholder RepresentativeÂ’s comments, the parties will cooperate to resolve
any disagreement prior to the due date for filing the Tax Return. If the
parties have not resolved any disagreement prior to the due date, then (i)
Parent will cause such Tax Return (as drafted by Parent) to be timely filed
and will provide a copy thereof to the Stockholder Representative, (ii) the
parties shall resolve any disagreement through the procedures provided in
Section 2.14(e) and (iii) upon resolution of any disagreement, the parties
shall amend any Tax Return if necessary, and Parent shall file such amended
Tax Return and provide a copy to the Stockholder Representative.

 



 

(f) Parent shall cause the amount of any and all Tax refunds or Tax credits
attributable to a Pre-Closing Period that are received or utilized by Parent
or any of ParentÂ’s Affiliates to be promptly paid to the Paying Agent (for
payment to the Company Securityholders) within five (5) Business Day of
receipt or utilization of such Tax refund or Tax credit.

 



 

(g) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, any Tax deductions
attributable to or arising from any vesting (including acceleration thereof)
and/or payment on or with respect to any Company Equity Securities, bonus,
severance payments, or other vesting or payments that become payable or vested
on or before the Closing Date as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be deducted in the Pre-
Closing Period or, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date

 



 

 **Section 5.17** **_Transition Planning_**. On or promptly following the
date hereof, the Company and Parent shall begin transition planning relating
to payroll, treasury management systems, financial reporting and control
systems in order to facilitate the migration, after the Closing Date, of (a)
the payroll and treasury management systems used by the Company to the Parent
system used by Buckingham, and (b) the financial reporting and control systems
used by the Company to the Buckingham Great Plains system.

 



 

 **Section 5.18** **_Code Section 280G_**. Prior to the Closing, the Company
will (a) use reasonable best efforts to obtain from each "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) of any Acquired
Company who may receive payment or benefits that are "contingent" within the
meaning of Code Section 280G on the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that could reasonably be expected to constitute a "parachute
payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code), a waiver
by such individual of any and all such parachute payments (or portions
thereof) whose aggregate present value exceeds the amount that is one dollar
less than three times the individualÂ’s "base amount" (within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) (any such waived payments, the " **Waived
Payments** ") and (b) submit to a shareholder vote (in a manner intended to
comply with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations thereunder)
the right of any "disqualified individual" who executed a waiver agreement as
contemplated by clause (a) to receive or retain his or her Waived Payments.
Prior to delivery to the stockholders and disqualified individuals of
documents in connection with the waiver and stockholder approval contemplated
under this paragraph, the Company will provide Parent or its counsel (i) a
table setting forth all excess parachute payments and the accompanying
computations, along with the assumptions used in the determination of such
excess parachute payments, and (ii) a reasonable

 



     

 

 



 

opportunity to review such information and comment on the form of waiver, the
disclosure statement to be provided to stockholders, and all other applicable
documents to be delivered to the stockholders and disqualified individuals in
connection with the vote. The Company shall deliver to Parent prior to the
Closing evidence (i) that a vote of the CompanyÂ’s stockholders was solicited
in conformance with Section 280G of the Code for the Waived Payments and (ii)
if such vote was conducted, either that the requisite approval of the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders was obtained with respect to the Waived Payments or
that the approval was not obtained and as a consequence, pursuant to the
waivers, such Waived Payments shall not be made or provided. Nothing in this
_Section 5.18_ shall be construed to require the Company or any other
Acquired Company to actually obtain a waiver of payments and/or benefits from
any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code). To
the extent that Parent or any of its Affiliates enter into or negotiate
compensation arrangements with any "disqualified individual" (within the
meaning of Section 280G) of any of the Acquired Companies that could result in
such PersonÂ’s receipt of any "parachute payments" (within the meaning of
Section 280G) (" **Buyer Payments** "), then Parent shall promptly notify the
Company of the amount, if any, of the Buyer Payments that are required to be
included in the Section 280G calculations and waiver materials (along with a
description of such "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section
280G)).

 



 

 **Section 5.19** **_Cybersecurity Matters_**. On or promptly following the
date hereof, the Company shall engage an independent third-party cybersecurity
audit firm, which shall be selected and engaged by the Company subject to
ParentÂ’s prior written approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), to conduct and complete penetration testing of the CompanyÂ’s
network systems by no later than October 31, 2018. Following the completion of
such testing, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to implement the
recommendations of such cybersecurity audit firm as a result of such testing,
and to provide Parent with confirmation of such implementation, prior to the
Closing Date. The fees and costs of such cybersecurity audit firm associated
with such engagement shall be borne by Parent.

(d) _Reorganization_. Since the date of this Agreement, there shall not have
occurred any change in Law or change in IRS published guidance that would
result in the Integrated Mergers, taken together, failing to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

have delivered to the Company the following closing documents in form and

executed by Parent.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII. 
TERMINATION**

 



 

 **Section 7.1** **_Termination_**. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned at any time, notwithstanding the approval thereof by
the stockholders of the Company, at any time prior to Closing as follows:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company, Parent and Newco;

 



 

(b) by either the Company or Parent, by written notice to the other party, if
the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before January 25, 2019 (the
" **Termination Date** "), unless extended by written agreement of the parties
hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
and abandon the Merger under this paragraph shall not be available to any
party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been
the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to occur on or prior
to such date;

 



 

(c) by either the Company or Parent, by written notice to the other party, if
a Governmental Entity shall have issued a Governmental Order or taken any
other action (including the failure to have taken an action), in any case
having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Merger, which Governmental Order or other action is final and
nonappealable, unless the failure to consummate the Closing because of such
action by a Governmental Entity shall be primarily due to the failure of
Parent or Newco (if Parent is seeking to terminate this Agreement), or of the
Company (if the Company is seeking to terminate this Agreement), to have
fulfilled any of its obligations under this Agreement;

 



 

(d) by Parent, by written notice to the Company, upon a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set
forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the Company
shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.2(a)_ would be incapable of being satisfied by the Termination
Date or, if curable, is not cured within thirty (30) days following the
receipt of written notice by the Company from Parent of such breach, but in no
event later than the Termination Date (it being understood that Parent may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)_ if Parent is in
material breach of this Agreement);

 



 

(e) by the Company, by written notice to Parent, upon a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Newco
set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent or
Newco shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set
forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ would be incapable of being satisfied

 



     

 

 



 

by the Termination Date or, if curable, is not cured within thirty (30) days
following the receipt of written notice by Parent from the Company of such
breach, but in no event later than the Termination Date (it being understood
that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
7.1(e)_ if the Company is in material breach of this Agreement); or

 



 

(f) by Parent, by written notice to the Company, if the Written Consent has
not been delivered within three (3) Business Days after the execution hereof.

 



 

 **Section 7.2** **_Effect of Termination_**. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Article VII_ hereof, this entire Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no effect and all rights and obligations of the parties
hereunder shall terminate and no party shall have any liability to the other
party, other than this _Section 7.2_ and the provisions of Article _IX_ and
Article _X_ and under the Confidentiality Agreement, each of which shall
survive the termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
termination shall not relieve any party from liability for any willful breach
of this Agreement. Any "willful breach" means a breach or failure to perform,
in each case, that is the consequence of an act or omission by a party with
the actual knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to take such act
would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII. 
SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

 **Section 8.1** **_Survival_**. All of the representations, warranties and
covenants of the parties contained in this Agreement or in a certificate
delivered at Closing shall survive the Closing hereunder and continue in full
force and effect until the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date
(the " **General Survival Expiration Date** "), except that (a) the
representations and warranties in _Sections 3.1(a)_ and _(b)_ (Organization
and Qualification), _Section 3.2_ (Capitalization of the Company;
Subsidiaries), _Section 3.3_ (Authorization), _Section 3.4(a)(A)_, _3.4(b)_
and _3.4(c)_ (Consents and Approvals; No Violations), and _Section 3.18_
(Brokers) shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect until
the six (6) year anniversary of the Closing Date, (b) the representations and
warranties in _Section 3.9_ (Tax Matters) shall survive the Closing and
remain in full force and effect until thirty (30) days after the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations (including any extension thereof) (the
representations and warranties listed in clauses (a) and (b), collectively,
the " **Company Fundamental Representations** " and the other representations
and warranties set forth in _Article III_, collectively, the " **Company
Basic Representations** "), (c) the representations and warranties in _Section
4.1_ (Organization), _Section 4.2_ (Authorization), _Section 4.3(a)_
(Consents and Approvals; No Violations), _Section 4.6_ (Brokers) and _Section
4.12(d)_ and _4.12(e)_ (Capitalization) (collectively, the " **Parent
Fundamental Representations** ") shall survive the Closing and remain in full
force and effect until the six (6) year anniversary of the Closing Date, and
(d) those covenants which by their terms contemplate performance after the
Closing shall survive the Closing for the period contemplated by their
respective terms until fully performed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
prior to the expiration of the claims periods specified above, an Indemnified
Party shall have asserted a claim made in good faith for indemnity hereunder
and such claim shall not have been fully resolved or disposed of at such date,
such claim shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity
hereunder until such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance
with the terms hereof (whether or not the claim has been filed with the
applicable Governmental Entity at the expiration of the specified period of
survival).

 



     

 

 



 

 **Section 8.2** **_Indemnification_.**

 



 

(a) _Indemnification by Company Securityholders for Company Matters_. Subject
to the limitations set forth in this _Article VIII_, following the Closing,
the Company Securityholders (severally and not jointly, as hereinafter
provided) shall indemnify the Parent Covered Parties and hold them harmless

Parent Covered Party suffers or incurs as a result of or in connection with:

 



 

(i) any breach of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
in _Article III_ of this Agreement (or any certificate delivered at Closing
by or on behalf of the Company);

forth in _Article IV_ of this Agreement (or in the certificate delivered at
Closing by or on behalf Parent and Newco);

 



 

(ii) any breach of any payment obligation of Parent or Newco set forth in this
Agreement; and

 



 

(iii) any breach of any covenant set forth in this Agreement (other than

Ultimate Surviving Corporation.

 



 

 **Section 8.3** **_Limitations to Indemnification; Manner of Payment_.**

 



 

(a) _Deductible_. As to any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)(i)_ (except with respect to breaches of the Company Fundamental
Representations) by the Parent Covered Parties and _Section 8.2(b)_ (except
with respect to breaches of the Parent Fundamental Representations and
_Section 4.7_ (Financial Capability)) by the Securityholder Covered Parties,

or Securityholder Covered Parties, as applicable, have incurred pursuant to
such applicable Sections exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000) (the " **De
Minimis Amount** ") and (ii) all Losses incurred pursuant to such applicable
Sections in excess of the De Minimis Amount exceed, in the aggregate, an
amount equal to $1,175,000 (the " **Deductible** "), in

 



     

 

 



 

which case such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification only to
the extent (and solely with respect to the amount that) such aggregate Losses

_provided_ that the foregoing limitations shall not apply in case of Fraud in
accordance with _Section 8.3(e)_ below.

_provided_ that Losses arising out of any breach of the Company Fundamental
Representations shall not be subject to the General Indemnity Cap; _provided_
, _further_ , that the foregoing limitations shall not apply in case of Fraud
in accordance with _Section 8.3(e)_ below.

 



 

(ii) In no event shall Parent be liable for any Losses as to claims for

case of Fraud in accordance with _Section 8.3(e)_ below.

 



 

(c) _Ultimate Indemnity Cap_.

 



 

(i) In no event shall any Company Securityholders be liable in the aggregate
for any Losses, as to claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_, in excess of such Company
SecurityholderÂ’s Pro Rata Share of the Indemnity Escrow Amount and all other
Distributions subject to set-off in the manner set forth in _Section
8.3(d)(ii)_; _provided_ that the foregoing limitations shall not apply in case
of Fraud in accordance with _Section 8.3(e)_ below.

 



 

(ii) Any claims for Losses pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)(ii)_ arising out of a
failure of Parent or Newco to make a particular payment set forth in this
Agreement shall be subject to an aggregate cap equal to (x) the aggregate
amount of such payment payable by Parent or Newco under this Agreement plus
(y) all reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses incurred in connection with
any Proceeding brought by the Securityholder Covered Parties pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ in connection with ParentÂ’s or NewcoÂ’s failure to make such

(z) $23,000,000.

 



 

(d) _Manner of Payment_.

 



 

(i) Any amounts owing to any Parent Covered Party pursuant to Losses claimed
under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ arising out of any breach of any of the Company

 



     

 

 



 

Basic Representations after the Deductible has been exceeded, shall be
recovered first from the Indemnity Escrow Account (in an amount not to exceed
one million one hundred seventy five thousand dollars ($1,175,000)) until the
retention amount under the RandW Insurance Policy has been satisfied, and within
three (3) Business Days of mutual agreement of the amount of Losses subject to
indemnification hereunder, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall
deliver written instructions to the Escrow Agent to disburse such amount from
the Indemnity Escrow Account. After the retention amount under the RandW
Insurance Policy has been satisfied, any further amounts owing to any Parent
Covered Party pursuant to Losses claimed under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ arising
out of any breach of any of the Company Basic Representations shall be
recoverable solely and exclusively under the RandW Insurance Policy.

 



 

(ii) Any amounts owing to any Parent Covered Party pursuant to Losses claimed
under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ arising out of any breach of any of the Company
Fundamental Representations and/or a claim pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_
shall be recovered in the following order: (A) first, from the Indemnity
Escrow Account until the retention amount under the RandW Insurance Policy has
been satisfied or the amounts in the Indemnity Escrow Account have been
exhausted and within three (3) Business Days of mutual agreement of the amount
of Losses subject to indemnification hereunder, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall deliver written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
disburse such amount from the Indemnity Escrow Account, and then (B) from the
RandW Insurance Policy until the RandW Insurance Policy has been exhausted (if the
RandW Insurance Policy responds to such Loss), and then (C) from the Indemnity
Escrow Account (to the extent there are then any funds remaining in the
Indemnity Escrow Account) and Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall
promptly deliver all necessary written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
effect such release, and (D) then, solely and exclusively by set-off by Parent
against Earn-Out Payments and any payments pursuant to _Section 2.14(d)_ to
be paid to the Company Securityholders in accordance with this Agreement. To
the extent an Earn-Out Payment or other payment pursuant to _Section 2.14(d)_
becomes payable at such time as a claim is pending for which Parent would have
a set-off right pursuant to this _Section 8.3(d)_, such portion as would be
subject to set-off shall be placed in escrow with the Escrow Agent pending
satisfaction of such claim pursuant to an amendment to the Escrow Agreement to
provide for such deposit into a separate escrow account and related release
upon written instructions of Parent and the Stockholder Representative.

 



 

(iii) Any amounts owing to any Parent Covered Party pursuant to Losses claimed
under _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_ shall be recovered in the following order: (A)
first, from the Litigation Escrow Account to the extent of the funds held
therein, (B) second, from the Indemnity Escrow Account and the Adjustment
Escrow Account to the extent of the funds held therein and (C) then, solely
and exclusively by set-off by Parent against Earn-Out Payments to be paid to
the Company Securityholders in accordance with this Agreement; _provided_ that
the amount that may be recovered pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) or (C)
shall not exceed five million dollars ($5,000,000).

 



 

(iv) The parties acknowledge and agree that, except with respect to any other
Merger Document to which a Company Securityholder is a direct party, no Parent
Covered Party may recover directly against a Company Securityholder for any
claim under

 



     

 

 



 

this Agreement, other than in the case of Fraud as described in _Section
8.3(e)_. Following the Closing, other than in the case of claims for Fraud in
accordance with _Section 8.3(e)_ or actions for specific performance pursuant
to _Section 10.14_, the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article
VIII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Covered Parties
against any Company Securityholder for any claims under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any Parent Covered Party may
seek to obtain recovery for any Loss in any temporal order it chooses,
regardless of the temporal order in which such Parent Covered Party incurred
such Loss, including, for the avoidance of doubt, seeking recovery of amounts
owing to any Parent Covered Party pursuant to Losses claimed under _Section
8.2(a)(i)_ arising out of any breach of any of the Company Basic
Representations prior to seeking recovery of amounts owing to any Parent
Covered Party pursuant to Losses claimed under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ arising
out of any breach of any of the Company Fundamental Representations and/or a
claim pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_. In order to determine its desired
order of recovery, any Parent Covered Party may defer its right to seek
recovery of any Losses claimed under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ arising out of any
breach of any of the Company Fundamental Representations and/or a claim
pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_ until immediately prior to the General
Survival Expiration Date, and such deferral shall not prejudice such Parent
Covered PartyÂ’s rights pursuant to this _Article VIII_ or otherwise in any
manner; _provided_ that the foregoing shall in no event affect any Parent
Covered PartyÂ’s obligations to provide prompt notice of claims for
indemnification as provided in this _Article VIII_.

 



 

(e) _Fraud_. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing limitations set forth
in this _Section 8.3_ shall not apply to claims for Fraud brought against the
perpetrators of such Fraud.

 



 

(f) _Additional Indemnification Provisions_.

 



 

(i) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
_Article VIII_ shall be net of (A) insurance proceeds (other than proceeds
from the RandW Insurance Policy) actually recovered by the Indemnified Party in
respect of such Losses (net of any out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection
with such recovery and any increases in premium) and (B) recoveries from third
parties (other than recoveries from the RandW Insurance Policy) pursuant to
indemnification or otherwise (net of any out-of-pocket costs incurred in
connection with such recovery).

 



 

(ii) If any Indemnified Party receives such insurance proceeds or indemnity or
similar payments (other than proceeds or payments from the RandW Insurance
Policy) after being indemnified with respect to some or all of any Losses,
such Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party the lesser of (A)
the amount of such insurance proceeds or indemnity or similar payment actually
received, less reasonable attorneyÂ’s fees and other reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with such recovery and (B) the aggregate
amount paid by the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party with respect
to such Losses.

 



 

(iii) No Indemnifying Party shall be liable pursuant to this _Article VIII_
for any punitive or special damages except, in each case, to the extent
constituting part of a Third Party Claim.

 



     

 

 



 

(iv) For the purposes of this _Article VIII_, any inaccuracy in or breach of
any representation or warranty of the Company, Parent or Newco shall be
determined (both for purposes of determining whether an inaccuracy or breach
has occurred and the amount of Losses attributable thereto) without giving
effect to any materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect or similar
qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to any such representation
or warranty, except for _Section 3.6(b)(ii)_ and the definition of Material
Contract.

 



 

(v) The right to indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall not be
affected by any investigation conducted at any time, or any knowledge acquired
(or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the
Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of, or compliance
with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement; provided,
however, that no Parent Covered Party may bring a claim for breach of the
second sentence of _Section 3.22_ if any Parent Covered Party had actual
knowledge of the facts resulting in such breach as of the date of delivery of
the Closing Statement or if such claim is with respect to any item of Closing
Date Indebtedness or Seller Expenses that were reflected in the calculation of
the Final Merger Consideration.

 



 

(vi) Each Company Securityholder expressly waives any right of indemnification
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to _Section 5.5_),
contribution from, subrogation to or recovery against the Acquired Companies
in connection with any Losses to be paid to the Parent Covered Parties under
this _Article VIII_.

 



 

(vii) Amounts paid to or on behalf of the Company Securityholders or Parent as
indemnification under this _Article VIII_ or any other remedy based on
covenants and agreements in this Agreement shall be treated as adjustments to
the aggregate Final Merger Consideration payable hereunder for all foreign,
U.S. federal, state and local income Tax purposes unless otherwise required by
applicable Law.

 



 

(g) _Pre-Closing Breach_. With respect to any breach set forth in the Closing
No Claims Declaration delivered by Parent at Closing pursuant to the RandW
Insurance Policy in respect of an Interim Breach (as defined in the RandW
Insurance Policy) (a " **Pre-Closing Breach** "), if Losses in respect of the
Pre-Closing Breach exceed the Deductible (in the event such Pre-Closing Breach
would be a breach of any of the Company Basic Representations), then
notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent
any portion of such claim in respect of such Pre-Closing Breach remains unpaid
upon exhaustion of the amounts in the Indemnity Escrow Account, then such
remaining claim amount may be satisfied solely and exclusively by set-off by
Parent against Earn-Out Payments to be paid to the Company Securityholders in
accordance with this Agreement; _provided_ that the amount that may be
recovered by set-off shall not exceed ten million dollars ($10,000,000). No
claim with respect to a Pre-Closing Breach may be made after the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Closing.

 



 

 **Section 8.4** **_Indemnification Procedures_**. Any claim or demand for
indemnification under this _Article VIII_ (other than pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)(iii)_) shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

 



 

(a) In the event that any Indemnified Party has a claim against any
Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall give the

 



      

 

 



 

Indemnifying Party written notice of any matter that such Indemnified Party
has determined has given or could give rise to a right of indemnification
hereunder, but the failure to provide such notice will not prejudice the
Indemnified PartyÂ’s right to indemnification, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying PartyÂ’s rights are actually prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(b) In the event that any claim for which the Indemnifying Party may be liable
to an Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted against an Indemnified Party by
a third party (a " **Third Party Claim** "), the Indemnified Party shall
deliver a notice to the Indemnifying Party promptly after such Indemnified
Party has actual knowledge of the assertion of such Third Party Claim, but the
failure to provide such notice will not prejudice the Indemnified PartyÂ’s
right to indemnification, except to the extent that the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s
rights are actually prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, and at its own expense, the
defense of such Third Party Claim, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate
with the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith; _provided_ that if the
Indemnifying Party is entitled to defend and so elects to defend such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to
participate in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by the
Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _further_ , that the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall not be borne by the Indemnifying Party unless the Indemnified
Party reasonably determines that conflict of interest exists that makes
representation by counsel chosen by the Indemnifying Party inadvisable or that
there are additional or different defenses available to it than those
available to the Indemnifying Party, in either of which cases, the fees and
expenses of counsel for the Indemnified Party shall be borne by the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle or compromise such
Third Party Claim without the Indemnified PartyÂ’s consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to undertake, conduct and control the
defense of a Third Party Claim if (i) such claim involves potential criminal
liability, regulatory matters or significant clients or vendors or other
significant relationships of the Indemnified Party, (ii) the Indemnified Party
reasonably determines that it would be inappropriate for a single counsel to
represent all parties under applicable standards of legal ethics, (iii) such
claim seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party, or (iv) the Indemnified Party reasonably determines that the
Indemnifying Party does not have sufficient resources to satisfy its
indemnification obligations or collecting on such obligations in full would be
unlikely or impose a significant burden on the Indemnified Party or that the
amount of the Third Party Claim if successful would be likely to exceed the
Indemnifying PartyÂ’s liability under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to undertake the defense of the
Third Party Claim or if the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to so undertake
the defense of such Third Party Claim as provided in _Section 8.4(b)_, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise the
Third Party Claim in the exercise of its reasonable discretion at the sole
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ that such Third Party
Claim shall not be compromised or settled without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any (i) notices to be provided or received
by, and (ii) claims, actions or consents to be taken or made by, any Company
Securityholder as an Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party shall be
provided, received, taken or

 



     

 

 



 

made, as applicable, by the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the
applicable Company Securityholder who is the Indemnifying Party or Indemnified
Party, but the indemnification rights and obligations themselves shall remain
with the relevant Company Securityholders who are Indemnifying Parties, as
applicable. Any indemnification payments to Company Securityholders pursuant
to _Section 8.2(b)_ shall be in accordance with the instructions of the
Stockholder Representative and subject to _Section 2.10(g)_.

 



 

 **Section 8.5** **_Specified Litigation_**. In the event a Parent Covered
Party has a claim for Losses arising under _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_, including
arising out of an Acquired CompanyÂ’s obligation to make any payments to the
adverse parties in the Specified Litigation as part of a Final Settlement or
the incurrence of legal or other fees and expenses in connection with the
ongoing defense of the Specified Litigation, Parent shall notify the
Stockholder Representative of the amount of such claim, and Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall provide joint written notice to the Escrow
Agent to promptly release such payment from the Litigation Escrow Account to
Parent. Parent shall control the defense of the Specified Litigation and upon
the request of the Stockholder Representative, Parent shall keep the
Stockholder Representative reasonably informed of the status of the Specified
Litigation and any potential Final Settlement thereof. " **Final Settlement**
" means either (i) a settlement of the Specified Litigation pursuant to a duly
executed settlement agreement or (ii) the Specified Litigation becomes subject
to a final and non-appealable Governmental Order issued by a court or
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction.

 



 

 **Section 8.6** **_Release of Litigation Escrow_**. Within five (5) Business
Days of a Final Settlement, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release any funds remaining in the
Litigation Escrow Account (for the avoidance of doubt, determined following
any payments to Parent required to be made pursuant to _Section 8.5_) to the
Company Securityholders as follows: (a) to the Paying Agent (on behalf of the
Company Stockholders), the Company StockholdersÂ’ aggregate Pro Rata Share of
such amount, and (b) to the Ultimate Surviving Corporation (on behalf of the
holders of Options), such Option holderÂ’s aggregate Pro Rata Share of such
amount, and the Ultimate Surviving Corporation shall promptly pay to each
holder of Options its Pro Rata Share of such amount; _provided_ , that in the
case of payments to employees or former employees of any Acquired Company for
which employment Tax withholding is required, such amounts shall be paid
through the Ultimate Surviving CorporationÂ’s (or its AffiliateÂ’s) payroll
processing service or system.

 



 

 **Section 8.7** **_Release of Indemnity Escrow_**. Within five (5) Business
Days after the General Survival Expiration Date, the Stockholder
Representative and Parent shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release
any funds remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account (less the aggregate amount
reasonably claimed by Parent pursuant to claims made against such funds in
accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and not fully resolved
prior to such date) to the Company Securityholders as follows: (a) to the
Paying Agent (on behalf of the Company Stockholders), the Company
StockholdersÂ’ aggregate Pro Rata Share of such amount, and (b) to the Ultimate
Surviving Corporation (on behalf of the holders of Options), such Option
holderÂ’s aggregate Pro Rata Share of such amount, and the Ultimate Surviving
Corporation shall promptly pay to each holder of Options its Pro Rata Share of
such amount; _provided_ , that in the case of payments to employees or former
employees of any Acquired Company for which employment Tax withholding is
required, such amounts shall be paid through the Ultimate Surviving
CorporationÂ’s (or its AffiliateÂ’s) payroll processing service or system. At
any time following the

 



     

 

 



 

General Survival Expiration Date, to the extent the available portion of the
funds remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account exceeds the aggregate amount
claimed by Parent pursuant to claims for indemnification under this _Article
VIII_ to be satisfied from the Indemnity Escrow Account and not fully resolved
prior to the time of determination, the Stockholder Representative and Parent
shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release from the Indemnity Escrow
Account any such excess to the Company Securityholders in accordance with the
payment procedures set forth immediately above.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX. 
STOCKHOLDERS REPRESENTATIVE**

 



 

 **Section 9.1** **_Authorization of Stockholder Representative._**

 



 

(a) The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the
Company Stockholders shall constitute the grant to the Stockholder
Representative to act as a representative for the benefit of the each Company
Securityholder as the exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact with the power and
authority to act on behalf of each holder of Company Equity Securities in
connection with and to facilitate the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, which shall
include the power and authority:

 



 

(i) to execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement (with such modifications or
changes therein as to which the Stockholder Representative, in its sole
discretion, shall have consented) and to agree to such amendments or
modifications thereto as the Stockholder Representative, in its sole
discretion, determines to be desirable;

 



 

(ii) to execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby as the Stockholder Representative, in its sole
discretion, may deem necessary or desirable;

 



 

(iii) to receive all notices or other documents given or to be given to any
Company Securityholder by Parent pursuant to this Agreement and the other
Merger Documents;

 



 

(iv) as the Stockholder Representative, to enforce and protect the rights and
interests of the Company Securityholders and to enforce and protect the rights
and interests of the Stockholder Representative arising out of or under or in
any manner relating to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and each other
agreement, document, instrument or certificate referred to herein or therein
or the transactions provided for herein or therein, and to take any and all
actions which the Stockholder Representative believes are necessary or
appropriate under the Escrow Agreement and/or this Agreement for and on behalf
of the Company Securityholders, including to (A) assert any claim or institute
any action, proceeding or investigation, and conduct negotiations with Parent,
the Ultimate Surviving Corporation and their respective representatives
regarding such claim, (B) investigate, defend, settle, contest or litigate any
claim, action, proceeding or investigation initiated by Parent, the Ultimate
Surviving Corporation or any other Person against the Stockholder
Representative and/or any of the Company Securityholders,

 



     

 

 



 

including any indemnity claim hereunder on behalf of any Company
Securityholder arising under this Agreement, and receive process on behalf of
any or all Company Securityholders in any such claim, action, proceeding or
investigation and compromise or settle on such terms as the Stockholder
Representative shall determine to be appropriate, and give receipts, releases
and discharges with respect to, any such claim, action, proceeding or
investigation, (C) file any proofs of debt, claims and petitions as the
Stockholder Representative may deem advisable or necessary, (D) settle or
compromise any claims asserted under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,
(E) engage special counsel, accountants and other advisors and incur such
other expenses in connection with any of the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement, (F) assume, on behalf of all of the Company Securityholders,
the defense of any Third Party Claim (pursuant to the terms of this Agreement)
that is the basis of any claim asserted under _Article VIII_ and (G) file and
prosecute appeals from any decision, judgment or award rendered in any such
action, proceeding or investigation;

 



 

(v) to refrain from enforcing any right of the Company Securityholders or any
of them and/or the Stockholder Representative arising out of or under or in
any manner relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other
agreement, instrument or document in connection with the foregoing; _provided_
, _however_ , that no such failure to act on the part of the Stockholder
Representative, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or in the
Escrow Agreement, shall be deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by
the Stockholder Representative or by the Company Securityholders unless such
waiver is in writing signed by the waiving party or by the Stockholder
Representative; and

 



 

(vi) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all action that the Stockholder
Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or
proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, and all other
agreements, documents or instruments referred to herein or therein or executed
in connection herewith and therewith.

 



 

(b) The Stockholder Representative acknowledges that following the Closing
Date, none of Parent, Newco, Merger Sub II, the Company, the Ultimate
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any
obligation or liability to the Stockholder Representative (except, if
applicable, any Affiliate in its capacity as a Company Securityholder),
including any obligation or liability pursuant to the SRS Letter Agreement.
The Company Securityholders shall not receive interest or other earnings on
the Expense Fund and the Company Securityholders irrevocably transfer and
assign to the Stockholder Representative any ownership right that they may
have in any interest that may accrue on funds held in the Expense Fund. The
Company Securityholders acknowledge that the Stockholder Representative is not
providing any investment supervision, recommendations or advice. The
Stockholder Representative shall have no responsibility or liability for any
loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of its willful
misconduct. For tax purposes, the Expense Fund shall be treated as having been
received and voluntarily set aside by the Company Securityholders at the time
of Closing. Once the Stockholder Representative determines, in its sole
discretion, that the Stockholder Representative will not incur any additional
expenses in its capacity as the Stockholder

 



     

 

 



 

Representative, then the Stockholder Representative will appropriately
distribute the remaining unused Expense Fund, if any, to the Company
Securityholders based on their Pro Rata Share (either directly or through a
third party paying agent), except in the case of payments to employees or
former employees of any Acquired Company for which employment tax withholding
is required, which such amounts shall be delivered to Parent or the Ultimate
Surviving Corporation and paid through ParentÂ’s or the Ultimate Surviving
CorporationÂ’s (or its AffiliateÂ’s) payroll processing service or system. In
connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent
Agreement and any instrument, agreement or document relating hereto or
thereto, and in exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the powers
conferred upon the Stockholder Representative hereunder (i) the Stockholder
Representative shall incur no responsibility whatsoever to any Company
Securityholders by reason of any error in judgment or other act or omission
performed or omitted hereunder or in connection with the Escrow Agreement, the
Paying Agent Agreement or any such other agreement, instrument or document,
excepting only responsibility for any act or failure to act which represents
willful misconduct, and (ii) the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled
to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent
experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other
act or omission of the Stockholder Representative pursuant to such advice
shall in no event subject the Stockholder Representative to liability to any
Company Securityholders. Each Company Securityholder shall indemnify the
Stockholder Representative against all losses, damages, liabilities, claims,
obligations, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneysÂ’, accountantsÂ’
and other expertsÂ’ fees and the amount of any judgment against them, of any
nature whatsoever (including, but not limited to, any and all expense
whatsoever reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending
against any litigation, commenced or threatened or any claims whatsoever) ("
**Representative Losses** "), arising out of or in connection with any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by the Stockholder Representative in connection
with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Paying Agent Agreement
(including, but not limited to, any claim, investigation, challenge, action or
proceeding or in connection with any appeal thereof, relating to the acts or
omissions of the Stockholder Representative hereunder, or under the Escrow
Agreement or otherwise), in each case as such Representative Loss is incurred
or suffered. In the event of any action or proceeding which finally
adjudicates that any Representative Loss was primarily caused by the willful
misconduct of the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative
will reimburse the Company Securityholders the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such willful misconduct. If
not paid directly to the Stockholder Representative by the Company
Securityholders, any such Representative Loss may be recovered by the
Stockholder Representative from (i) the funds in the Expense Fund and (ii) the
amounts in the Litigation Escrow Account and Adjustment Escrow Account
otherwise distributable for the benefit of the Company Securityholders
pursuant to the terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement at the time of
distribution in accordance with written instructions delivered by the
Stockholder Representative to the Ultimate Surviving Corporation; _provided_
that while this section allows the Stockholder Representative to be paid from
the aforementioned sources of funds, this does not relieve the Company
Securityholders from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative
Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholder
Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at Law or otherwise.
In no event will the Stockholder Representative be required to advance its own
funds on behalf of the Company Securityholders or otherwise. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on
liability or indemnification obligations of the Company Securityholders set
forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the
indemnities provided to the Stockholder Representative under this section. The

 



     

 

 



 

foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of
the Stockholder Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the Stockholder
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time and/or
any termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) The Stockholder Representative represents and warrants to each other party
hereto that: (i) it is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its formation; (ii) it has the requisite
limited liability company right, power, authority and legal capacity to
execute, deliver and perform this Agreement; (iii) the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement has been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary action of the Stockholder Representative, its managers, directors,
members, or stockholders, as applicable; (iv) this Agreement is a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Stockholder Representative, enforceable against
it in accordance with its terms; and (v) the execution, delivery and
performance by the Stockholder Representative of this Agreement does not, and
will not, (x) conflict with the Organizational Documents of the Stockholder
Representative, or (y) conflict with or result in the breach of, or constitute
a default under any Contract to which the Stockholder Representative is bound.

 



 

(e) The Stockholder Representative may resign at any time. If the Stockholder
Representative shall have resigned, died or has otherwise become incapacitated
or removed by a majority of the interest in the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time, the Company Securityholders who in the aggregate held at
least a majority of the interest in the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall appoint, subject to the prior approval of Parent (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld), a successor stockholder
representative not later than 30 days following the resignation, death,
incapacity or removal of the Stockholder Representative.

 



 

(f) Parent and the Ultimate Surviving Corporation shall have the right to rely
solely upon all actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Stockholder
Representative, all of which actions or omissions shall be legally binding
upon the Company Securityholders. Parent and the Ultimate Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon the communications of
the Stockholder Representative relating to the foregoing as the communications
of the Company Securityholders. Parent and the Ultimate Surviving Corporation
(i) need not be concerned with the authority of the Stockholder Representative
to act on behalf of all Company Securityholders hereunder, and (ii) shall not
be held liable or accountable in any manner for any act or omission of the
Stockholder Representative in such capacity.

 



 

(g) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any holder of Company Equity Securities; and (ii) shall survive
the consummation of the Merger.

 **Section 10.2** **_Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules_**. All Exhibits
(including _Exhibit D_ (Form of Letter of Transmittal)), Annexes and
Schedules, are hereby incorporated into this Agreement and are hereby made a
part hereof as if set out in full in this Agreement and are an integral part
of this Agreement. The disclosure of any matter, or reference to any contract,
in any Schedule to this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed with
respect to every other Schedule if the relevance of such disclosure to such
other Schedules is reasonably apparent on its face, but shall not be deemed to
constitute an admission by the Company or to otherwise imply that any such
matter or contract is material for the purposes of this Agreement and shall
not affect the interpretation of such term for the purposes of this Agreement.
In particular, (a) certain matters may be disclosed on the Schedules that may
not be required to be disclosed because of certain minimum thresholds or
materiality standards set forth in this Agreement, (b) the disclosure of any
such matter does not

 



     

 

 



 

mean that it meets or surpasses any such minimum thresholds or materiality
standards and (c) no disclosure in the Schedules relating to any possible
breach or violation of any contract or Law shall be construed as an admission
or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually
occurred. In no event shall the listing of such matters in any Schedule be
deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of the CompanyÂ’s representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement. Each Schedule is qualified in its
entirety by reference to specific provisions of the Agreement and does not
constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting, representations,
warranties or covenants of the Company or its Affiliates, except as and to the
extent provided in this Agreement. Matters reflected in a Schedule are not
necessarily limited to matters or contracts required by this Agreement to be
disclosed in such Schedules. Regardless of the existence or absence of cross-
references, the disclosure of any matter in any Schedule shall be deemed to be
a disclosure for purposes of this Agreement and each Schedule to the extent
that the relevance of such disclosure is reasonably apparent from its text.
The section headings in the Schedules are for convenience of reference only
and shall not be deemed to alter or affect the meaning or interpretation of
any information disclosed herein or any provision of this Agreement. All
attachments to the Schedules are incorporated by reference into the Schedule
in which they are directly or indirectly referenced. The information
contained in the Schedules is in all events subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 10.3** **_Time of the Essence; Computation of Time_**. Time is of
the essence for each and every provision of this Agreement. When calculating
the period of time before which, within which or following which any act is to
be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the
reference date in calculating such period shall be excluded. Whenever the last
day, or the day, as applicable, for the exercise of any privilege or the
discharge or any duty hereunder shall fall upon a Saturday, Sunday, or any
date on which banks in New York City are authorized to be closed, the party
having such privilege or duty may exercise such privilege or discharge such
duty on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day.

 



 

 **Section 10.4** **_Expenses_**. Regardless of whether the transactions
provided for in this Agreement are consummated, except as otherwise provided
herein, each party hereto shall pay its own costs and expenses (including
investment advisory and legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein. At the Closing,
Parent shall pay fifty percent (50%) of all costs and fees of the Paying Agent
and the Escrow Agent. Parent shall pay all expenses related to the
solicitations pursuant to _Section 5.9(c)_ incurred prior to the Closing,
including the preparation, printing and mailing of proxy solicitation
materials, and other actions related to obtaining the solicitations.

 



 

 **Section 10.5** **_No Recourse_**. Except to the extent expressly set forth
in this Agreement or as otherwise set forth in the Merger Documents to which
such Non-Recourse Party is a party, Parent and the Company agree and
acknowledge that no recourse under this Agreement or any documents or
instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement shall be had against
any former, current or future director, officer, employee or equityholder of
the Company or any of its Affiliates (each, a " **Company Non-Recourse Party**
"), on the one hand, or Parent, Newco or any of their respective Affiliates
(each, a " **Parent Non-Recourse Party** " and, together with a Company Non-
Recourse Party, each a " **Non-Recourse Party** "), on the other hand, as
such, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other
applicable Law, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that, except as
expressly set forth

 



     

 

 



 

in this Agreement or as otherwise set forth in the Merger Documents to which
such Non-Recourse Party is a party, no personal liability whatsoever shall
attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any Company Non-Recourse
Party, on the one hand, or any Parent Non-Recourse Party, on the other hand,
as such, for any obligation under this Agreement, or pursuant to any documents
or instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement for any claim based
on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. This
_Section 10.5_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any beneficiary of this _Section 10.5_ without the express
written consent of such affected beneficiary (it being expressly agreed that
the beneficiaries of this _Section 10.5_ shall be third-party beneficiaries
of this _Section 10.5_). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section
10.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit any rights of any party
against a Person in the case of Fraud by such Person.

 



 

 **Section 10.6** **_Governing Law; Jurisdiction_**. THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL
CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) THAT MAY
BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF
ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
MADE IN OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR AS AN INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT), SHALL BE CONSTRUED, PERFORMED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ITS PRINCIPLES OR
RULES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS TO THE EXTENT SUCH PRINCIPLES OR RULES WOULD REQUIRE
OR PERMIT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION. THE DELAWARE
COURT OF CHANCERY SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OVER ANY AND ALL DISPUTES,
WHETHER IN LAW OR EQUITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
PARTIES CONSENT TO AND AGREE TO SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH
COURT; _PROVIDED_ , _HOWEVER_ , THAT IF THE DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY
DETERMINES THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION, THE PARTIES CONSENT TO AND
AGREE TO SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS
LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE OF DELAWARE. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES AND
AGREES NOT TO ASSERT IN ANY SUCH DISPUTE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
LAW, ANY CLAIM THAT (I) SUCH PARTY IS NOT PERSONALLY SUBJECT TO THE
JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS, (II) SUCH PARTY AND SUCH PARTYÂ’S PROPERTY IS
IMMUNE FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS ISSUED BY SUCH COURTS OR (III) ANY LITIGATION OR
OTHER PROCEEDING COMMENCED IN SUCH COURTS IS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.
EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, AND AGREES TO
CAUSE ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO WAIVE, ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 



 

 **Section 10.7** **_Legal Representation_**. Dechert LLP has represented the
Acquired Companies and certain Company Securityholders. All parties to this
Agreement recognize the commonality of interest that exists and will continue
to exist between the Acquired Companies and the Company Securityholders until
Closing, and the parties agree that such commonality of interest should
continue to be recognized after the Closing. Specifically, Parent agrees that
(a) it shall not,

 



      

 

 



 

and shall not cause the Acquired Companies to, seek to have Dechert LLP
disqualified from representing any Company Securityholders, Stockholder
Representative or any Company SecurityholderÂ’s Affiliate (other than the
Acquired Companies) in connection with any dispute that may arise between such
parties, on the one hand, and Parent or the Acquired Companies, on the other
hand, in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (b) in connection with any such dispute, any Company
Securityholder, Stockholder Representative or any such Company
SecurityholderÂ’s Affiliate involved in such dispute (and not Parent or the
Acquired Companies) will have the right to decide whether or not to waive the
attorney-client privilege that may apply to any communications between the
Acquired Companies and Dechert LLP that occurred prior to the Closing in the
course of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby involving attorney-client confidences (which right shall
not apply, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any dispute with a
third party or shall otherwise limit Parent and the Acquired CompaniesÂ’
ability to otherwise disclose such communications to the extent legally
required to do so).

 



 

 **Section 10.8** **_Assignment; Successors and Assigns; No Third Party
Rights_**. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement may not,
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, be assigned by
operation of Law or otherwise, and any attempted assignment shall be null and
void; _provided_ that Parent may assign its rights and obligations hereunder
to an Affiliate so long as Parent remains obligated to perform its obligations
hereunder. This Agreement shall be for the sole benefit of the parties to this
Agreement and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and except
for _Section 5.5_, _Section 10.5_ and _Article VIII_, nothing herein is
intended, nor shall be construed, to give any Person, other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim hereunder.

 



 

 **Section 10.9** **_Counterparts_**. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts for the convenience of the parties hereto, each of which
shall be deemed an original and all of which together will constitute one and
the same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
to this Agreement by facsimile or electronic transmission shall be effective
as delivery of a mutually executed counterpart to this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 10.10** **_Titles and Headings_**. The titles, captions and table
of contents in this Agreement are for reference purposes only, and shall not
in any way define, limit, extend or describe the scope of this Agreement or
otherwise affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 10.11** **_Entire Agreement_**. This Agreement, including the
Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Merger
Documents constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the matters covered hereby and supersede all previous written, oral or implied
understandings among the parties with respect to such matters.

 



 

 **Section 10.12** **_Severability_**. The invalidity of any portion hereof
shall not affect the validity, force or effect of the remaining portions
hereof. If it is ever held that any restriction hereunder is too broad to
permit enforcement of such restriction to its fullest extent, such restriction
shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by Law.

 



     

 

 



 

 **Section 10.13** **_No Strict Construction_**. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledge that this Agreement has been prepared jointly by the parties
hereto, and shall not be strictly construed against either party.

 



 

 **Section 10.14** **_Specific Performance_**.

 



 

(a) Each of the Company and Parent and Newco acknowledge that the rights of
each party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and
recognize and affirm that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any
party, money damages will be inadequate and the non-breaching party may have
no adequate remedy at Law. Accordingly, the parties agree that such non
breaching party shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and
remedies existing in their favor at law or in equity, to enforce their rights
and the other partyÂ’s obligations hereunder not only by an action or actions
for damages but also by an action or actions for specific performance,
injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other
security). Subject to the foregoing, each of the parties agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at
law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at law or in equity. Subject to _Section 10.14(b)_, Parent and
Newco acknowledge that prior to the Closing or the earlier valid termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, the Company will have the right
to specifically enforce the obligations of Parent and Newco to consummate the
Merger on the terms and pursuant to the conditions of this Agreement, only if
all conditions to ParentÂ’s obligations to close have been satisfied or waived
by Parent, or are capable of being satisfied at the Closing. If any claim,
action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of this Agreement is brought
with respect to or because of an alleged dispute, breach, default or
misrepresentation in connection with any of the provisions hereof, the
successful or prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable
attorneysÂ’ fees and other costs incurred in that claim, action, suit or
proceeding, in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.

 



 

(b) In the event the Company brings an action for specific performance
pursuant to this _Section 10.14_, and a court rules that Parent or Newco
breached this Agreement in connection with its failure to effect the Closing
in accordance with Article _II_ , but such court declines to enforce
specifically the obligations of Parent and Newco to effect the Closing in
accordance with Article _II_ , then, in addition to the right of the Company
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, the Company shall be
entitled to pursue all applicable remedies at law. For the avoidance of doubt,
in no event shall the exercise of the CompanyÂ’s right to seek specific
performance pursuant to this _Section 10.14_ reduce, restrict or otherwise
limit the CompanyÂ’s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1_ and/or pursue all applicable remedies at Law.

 



 

 **Section 10.15** **_Failure or Indulgence not Waiver_**. No failure or
delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder
shall impair such right or be construed to be waiver of, or acquiescence in,
any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any
single exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this
Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies
otherwise available.

 



     

 

 



 

 **Section 10.16** **_Amendments_**. No amendment or waiver of any provision
of, or consent required by, this Agreement, nor any consent to any departure
from the terms of this Agreement, shall be effective unless it is in writing
and, prior to the Closing, signed by Parent and the Company, and after the
Closing, signed by Parent and the Stockholder Representative.
