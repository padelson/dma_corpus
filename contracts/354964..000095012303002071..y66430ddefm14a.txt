                   NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
                          TO BE HELD ON MARCH 28, 2003

To the Stockholders of HOUSEHOLD INTERNATIONAL, INC.:

     Notice is hereby given that a special meeting of stockholders of Household
International, Inc. will be held at Household International, Inc., 2700 Sanders
Road, Prospect Heights, Illinois, on March 28, 2003, at 10:00 a.m. local time
for the following purposes:

     1.  To consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of November 14, 2002, by and among HSBC Holdings plc, Household
International, Inc. and H2 Acquisition Corporation, pursuant to which, among
other things, Household will be merged with and into H2 Acquisition Corporation,
a wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC, and HSBC will acquire Household. In the
merger, each outstanding share of Household common stock, par value $1.00 per
share, will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the
holder, either 2.675 HSBC ordinary shares or 0.535 HSBC American depositary
shares, each of which represents an ownership interest in five HSBC ordinary
shares, and each outstanding share of Household 7 5/8% cumulative preferred
stock, Series 2002-B, no par value, 7.50% cumulative preferred stock, Series
2001-A, no par value, 7.60% cumulative preferred stock, Series 2002-A, no par
value, and 8 1/4% cumulative preferred stock, Series 1992-A, no par value, will
be converted into the right to receive cash in the amount of $1,000 per share
($25 per depositary share representing 1/40th of a share), plus all accrued and
unpaid dividends up to but excluding the closing date. Each outstanding share of
Household 5% cumulative preferred stock, no par value, $4.30 cumulative
preferred stock, no par value, and $4.50 cumulative preferred stock, no par
value, will be designated for redemption effective prior to the merger and
Household will deposit the applicable redemption price in trust for the holders
of these shares under the terms of the instruments governing their shares.

     2.  To transact any other business as may properly come before the special
meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof.

     Holders of record of Household common stock and voting preferred stock,
consisting of 5% cumulative preferred stock, $4.30 cumulative preferred stock
and $4.50 cumulative preferred stock, all as of the close of business on
February 21, 2003, are entitled to vote at the special meeting. Holders of
record of Household's 7 5/8% cumulative preferred stock, 7.50% cumulative
preferred stock, 7.60% cumulative preferred stock and 8 1/4% cumulative
preferred stock are not entitled to vote at the special meeting, and are
entitled to appraisal rights as more fully described in the attached document.

     YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT. BECAUSE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT REQUIRES
THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF THE HOLDERS OF AT LEAST A MAJORITY OF THE OUTSTANDING
SHARES OF HOUSEHOLD COMMON STOCK AND VOTING PREFERRED STOCK, VOTING TOGETHER AS
A SINGLE CLASS, A FAILURE TO VOTE WILL HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS A VOTE AGAINST
THE MERGER (EXCEPT THAT SHARES OF HOUSEHOLD COMMON STOCK CREDITED TO AN ACCOUNT
UNDER THE HOUSEHOLD INTERNATIONAL TAX REDUCTION INVESTMENT PLAN FOR WHICH VOTING
INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT RECEIVED WILL BE VOTED BY THE PLAN'S TRUSTEE IN THE SAME
WAY AS THE MAJORITY OF THE SHARES HELD UNDER THE PLAN FOR WHICH VOTING
INSTRUCTIONS ARE RECEIVED). WHETHER OR NOT YOU EXPECT TO VOTE IN PERSON AT THE
SPECIAL MEETING, PLEASE COMPLETE, SIGN AND DATE THE ENCLOSED PROXY CARD AND
RETURN IT IN THE ENCLOSED ENVELOPE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. YOU MAY ALSO GRANT YOUR
PROXY BY TELEPHONE OR ON THE INTERNET AS DESCRIBED IN THE ENCLOSED PROXY CARD.
Giving your proxy now will not affect your right to vote in person if you attend
the special meeting and vote personally.

                                         By Order of the Board of Directors,

                                         /s/ KENNETH H. ROBIN

                                         KENNETH H. ROBIN
                                         Executive Vice President-General

                             QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q.  WHEN AND WHERE IS THE SPECIAL MEETING?

A.  The special meeting of Household stockholders will be held at Household
    International, Inc., 2700 Sanders Road, Prospect Heights, Illinois on March
    28, 2003, at 10:00 a.m. local time.

Q.  HOW DO I VOTE?

A.  After you have carefully read this document, please mail your signed proxy
    card in the enclosed postage-paid envelope to Computershare Investor
    Services LLC as soon as possible so that your stock may be represented and
    voted at the Household special meeting. You may also grant your proxy by
    telephone, on the Internet or vote in person at the Household special
    meeting. If your shares are held in "street name", i.e., in the name of a
    broker, bank or other record holder, you must either direct the record
    holder as to how to vote your stock or obtain a proxy from the record holder
    to vote at the special meeting. For more information regarding how to vote
    your stock, please refer to "The Special Meeting of Household
    Stockholders -- How You Can Vote."

Q.  MAY I CHANGE MY VOTE?

A.  Yes. You may withdraw your proxy or change your vote by delivering a
    later-dated, signed written notice of revocation or proxy card to the
    Corporate Secretary of Household before the Household special meeting or by
    voting in person at the Household special meeting. You may also withdraw
    your proxy or change your vote by telephone or on the Internet as described
    in this document.

Q.  SHOULD I SEND IN MY STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A.  No. After the companies complete the merger, HSBC will send instructions to
    Household stockholders whose stock was converted in the merger. These
    instructions will explain how to exchange certificates representing shares
    of Household common stock for either HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs, and
    how to exchange certificates representing shares of Household 7 5/8%
    cumulative preferred stock, 7.50% cumulative preferred stock, 7.60%
    cumulative preferred stock and 8 1/4% cumulative preferred stock for cash.

    Immediately prior to closing, Household will deposit the redemption price of
    the Household 5% cumulative preferred stock, $4.30 cumulative preferred
    stock and $4.50 cumulative preferred stock in trust for the holders of the
    shares, and will take the other steps required to redeem these shares in
    accordance with their respective terms. Holders of such preferred stock will
    receive a notice of redemption from Household that will explain how to
    exchange their stock certificates for the redemption price.

Q.  WHEN IS THE MERGER EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED?

A.  HSBC and Household expect to complete the merger during the first quarter of
    2003. Because the merger is subject to regulatory approvals in a number of
    jurisdictions and other conditions, the companies cannot predict the exact
    timing.

Q.  WHOM CAN I CALL WITH QUESTIONS?

A.  If you have more questions about the merger, or would like additional copies
    of this document, you should contact:

                                    SUMMARY

     This summary highlights selected information from this document. It does
not contain all of the information that is important to you. You should read
this document and the additional documents referred to in this document
carefully to fully understand the merger.

IN THE MERGER, ONE SHARE OF HOUSEHOLD COMMON STOCK MAY BE EXCHANGED FOR 2.675
HSBC ORDINARY SHARES OR 0.535 HSBC ADSS, AT YOUR ELECTION (SEE PAGE 75)

     Each holder of Household common stock will receive, at the holder's
election, either 2.675 HSBC ordinary shares or 0.535 HSBC American depositary
shares, or HSBC ADSs, for each share of Household common stock held. We refer to
this as the exchange ratio. Each HSBC ADS represents an ownership interest in
five HSBC ordinary shares. Promptly following the merger, Computershare Investor
Services LLC, as exchange agent, will mail to holders of record of Household
common stock a letter of transmittal for holders to use in making their election
to receive HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs.

HOUSEHOLD PREFERRED STOCK WILL BE REDEEMED FOR CASH OR EXCHANGED FOR CASH IN THE
MERGER (SEE PAGE 75)

     Each holder of Household 7 5/8% cumulative preferred stock, 7.50%
cumulative preferred stock, 7.60% cumulative preferred stock and 8 1/4%
cumulative preferred stock will receive cash in the amount of $25 per depositary
share representing 1/40th of a share ($1,000 per share), plus all accrued and
unpaid dividends up to but excluding the closing date. This preferred stock is
referred to in this document as the non-voting preferred stock.

     Each outstanding share of Household 5% cumulative preferred stock, $4.30
cumulative preferred stock and $4.50 cumulative preferred stock will be
designated for redemption effective prior to the merger and Household will
deposit the applicable redemption price in trust for the holders of these shares
under the terms of the instruments governing their shares. This preferred stock
is referred to in this document as the voting preferred stock.

THE IMPLIED VALUE OF THE CONSIDERATION PER SHARE OF HOUSEHOLD COMMON STOCK THAT
YOU WILL RECEIVE WILL DEPEND ON THE MARKET PRICE OF HSBC ORDINARY SHARES AND
HSBC ADSS ON THE DATE THE CONSIDERATION IS RECEIVED; THAT VALUE MAY BE HIGHER OR
LOWER THAN IT WAS ON NOVEMBER 13, 2002, ON THE DATE THIS DOCUMENT WAS MAILED OR
ON THE DATE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING OF HOUSEHOLD STOCKHOLDERS (SEE PAGE 89)

     The dollar value of the consideration that Household common stockholders
will receive as a result of the merger will depend on the price of HSBC ordinary
shares or HSBC ADSs that Household stockholders elect to receive and the pounds
sterling/U.S. dollar exchange rate on the date the merger consideration is
received. The market value of the consideration that holders of Household common
stock will receive for each share of Household common stock owned will be equal
to either 2.675 times the market price of an HSBC ordinary share, or 0.535 times
the market price of an HSBC ADS.

     Based on the closing mid-market price of HSBC ordinary shares on the London
Stock Exchange and the then current pounds sterling/U.S. dollar exchange rate:

     - on November 13, 2002, the last full trading day in London prior to the
       announcement of the merger, the implied value per share of Household
       common stock was $30.04, and

     - on February 25, 2003, the latest practicable date prior to the printing
       of this document, the implied value per share of Household common stock
       was $28.23.

     Based on the closing market price of the HSBC ADSs on the New York Stock
Exchange:

     - on November 13, 2002, the implied value per share of Household common
       stock was $29.99, and

     - on February 25, 2003, the implied value per share of Household common
       stock was $28.61.

     The exchange ratio of either 2.675 HSBC ordinary shares or 0.535 HSBC ADSs
to be received in the merger for each share of Household common stock is fixed.
There will be no adjustment to the exchange ratio for changes in the market
price of either Household common stock or HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs.
Accordingly, the market value of the HSBC ordinary shares or

                                        1
<PAGE>

HSBC ADSs to be received by holders of Household common stock in the merger will
depend on the market price of HSBC ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs at the time
they are received and could vary significantly from the market value on November
13, 2002, on February 25, 2003 or on the date of the special meeting of
Household stockholders. As a result of the fixed exchange ratio, holders of
Household common stock bear the risk of a decline in the market price of HSBC
ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs.

THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OWNING HSBC ADSS AND HSBC ORDINARY SHARES (SEE
PAGES 120-130)

     HSBC ADSs have been created to allow U.S. stockholders more easily to hold
interests in HSBC ordinary shares and to trade those interests on the New York
Stock Exchange. Each HSBC ADS represents an ownership interest in, and the
holder may at any time convert this interest into, five HSBC ordinary shares.
Your rights as a holder of HSBC ADSs will in some cases be different from the
rights of a holder of HSBC ordinary shares. For example:

     - DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS: Holders of HSBC ADSs will receive cash
       dividends or other distributions in proportion to the number of HSBC
       ordinary shares represented by such HSBC ADSs, less the fees and expenses
       (if any) of The Bank of New York.

     - VOTING RIGHTS: Holders of HSBC ADSs are entitled to vote on a poll on
       matters submitted to holders of HSBC ordinary shares. The Bank of New
       York will enable a holder of HSBC ADSs to attend and vote on a poll at a
       meeting by appointing the holder its proxy for the underlying HSBC
       ordinary shares. If the holder does not wish to attend a meeting, the
       holder may instruct The Bank of New York to appoint another person to
       attend and vote on a poll on the holder's behalf. In neither case will
       the person appointed by The Bank of New York be entitled to vote on a
       show of hands.

     - TAXES:

       - A transfer for value of HSBC ordinary shares is generally subject to
         U.K. stamp duty tax of 0.5%, payable by the purchaser.

       - A transfer for value of HSBC ADSs is not subject to U.K. stamp duty
         or to U.K. stamp duty reserve tax.

       - If a holder of HSBC ADSs exercises its right to convert its HSBC ADSs
         into HSBC ordinary shares, the transfer of the underlying HSBC ordinary
         shares from the depositary to the HSBC ADS holder is subject to stamp
         duty tax at the fixed rate of L5 per transfer.

       - If a holder of HSBC ordinary shares exercises its right to convert its
         HSBC ordinary shares into HSBC ADSs, the transfer of the HSBC ordinary
         shares to the depositary is subject to stamp duty or stamp duty reserve
         tax equal to 1.5% of the value of the shares (rounded up, in the case
         of stamp duty, to the nearest L5). HSBC has agreed to pay such stamp
         duty or stamp duty reserve tax in connection with the initial issuance
         of HSBC ADSs in connection with the merger.

THE HSBC ORDINARY SHARES AND HSBC ADSS TO BE ISSUED IN THE MERGER WILL BE LISTED
AND TRADED ON VARIOUS EXCHANGES (SEE PAGE 89)

     The HSBC ordinary shares to be issued in the merger (including the ordinary
shares underlying the HSBC ADSs to be issued in the merger) will be admitted to
the Official List of the U.K. Listing Authority and to trading on the London
Stock Exchange, and will be listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited,
Euronext Paris and the New York Stock Exchange. The HSBC ordinary shares will
trade on the London Stock Exchange under the symbol "HSBA", on The Stock
Exchange of Hong Kong Limited under the symbol "005" and on Euronext Paris under
the symbol "PHSB". The HSBC ADSs to be issued in the merger will be listed on
the New York Stock Exchange and will trade under the symbol "HBC".

HOLDERS OF HOUSEHOLD COMMON STOCK ARE ENTITLED TO THE BENEFIT OF THE HSBC SECOND
INTERIM DIVIDEND IN LIEU OF THE FINAL DIVIDEND FOR 2002 (SEE PAGES 79 AND 82)

     The merger will not be completed prior to the record date for HSBC's second
interim dividend. As

                                        2
<PAGE>

a result, the holders of Household common stock will not be entitled to receive
that dividend on the HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs they receive in the
merger. However, the Household board of directors is entitled, in its
discretion, to declare and pay additional cash dividends on the Household common
stock, and otherwise to take appropriate steps, so that holders of Household
common stock receive further dividends per share of Household common stock up
to, in the aggregate, 2.675 times the HSBC second interim dividend per HSBC
ordinary share, unless HSBC has taken alternative steps, reasonably acceptable
to Household, to provide the same economic benefit to holders of Household
common stock. Household expects, subject to applicable law, that Household's
board of directors will declare a dividend on Household common stock with a
record date immediately prior to the completion of the merger, with the dividend
to be paid on May 6, 2003, the same day that the HSBC second interim dividend is
paid, or if the merger is completed subsequent to May 6, 2003, to be paid
promptly following the merger. For more information on historical dividends paid
to holders of Household common stock and HSBC ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs,
please refer to "Market Price and Dividend Data".

THE MERGER IS GENERALLY TAX FREE TO HOLDERS OF HOUSEHOLD COMMON STOCK AND
TAXABLE TO HOLDERS OF HOUSEHOLD PREFERRED STOCK (SEE PAGE 70)

     Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton have
delivered to Household and HSBC, respectively, their opinions, dated the date of
this document, that (1) the merger will be treated for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the U.S.
tax code, (2) each transfer of property to HSBC by a stockholder of Household
pursuant to the merger will not be subject to Section 367(a)(1) of the U.S. tax
code and (3) U.S. holders of Household common stock will not recognize any
taxable gain or loss on the exchange of their stock for HSBC ordinary shares or
HSBC ADSs, but will recognize a taxable gain or loss in respect of any cash
received instead of a fractional HSBC ordinary share (or fractional HSBC ADS)
that they would otherwise be entitled to receive. U.S. holders of Household
preferred stock (whether their stock is converted into the right to receive cash
in the merger or designated for redemption for cash prior to the merger) will
recognize a taxable gain or loss on the exchange of their stock for cash.

OWNING HSBC ORDINARY SHARES IS DIFFERENT FROM OWNING HOUSEHOLD COMMON STOCK (SEE
PAGE 131)

     As a result of the merger, holders of Household common stock will receive,
at their election, either HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs. Each HSBC ADS
represents an ownership interest in five HSBC ordinary shares. There are
differences between the rights of a holder of common stock in Household, a
Delaware corporation, and the rights of a holder of ordinary shares in HSBC, an
English company. For example:

     - only holders representing 5% or more of the voting power of HSBC or 100
       shareholders holding shares paid up as to an average sum, per
       shareholder, of not less than L100, acting together, will, with prior
       written notice to HSBC, be able to propose resolutions to be considered
       at annual general meetings of HSBC, whereas any Household stockholder who
       is entitled to vote at the meeting may bring business before a Household
       stockholders' meeting,

     - persons acquiring 3% or more of the voting power of HSBC will generally
       be required to make public disclosures and notifications with respect to
       their ownership,

     - amendments to HSBC's Memorandum and Articles of Association will require
       the approval of at least 75% of the votes cast at a shareholders' meeting
       of HSBC, whereas amendments to Household's Certificate of Incorporation
       require the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding
       stock entitled to vote thereon,

     - except in limited circumstances, holders of HSBC ordinary shares will not
       be entitled to appraisal rights in mergers or any other types of
       transactions,

     - HSBC generally will not have the same freedom as Household has to adopt
       defensive measures in the event of a takeover bid, and

     - although holders of HSBC ordinary shares will be permitted to initiate
       lawsuits on behalf of the company in limited circumstances, holders will
       not be able to initiate shareholder class action lawsuits against HSBC.

     You should also be aware that it may be difficult to effect service of
process to begin a lawsuit in a U.S.

                                        3

court against directors and officers of HSBC who are not residents of the United
States.

HOUSEHOLD AND HSBC BELIEVE THE MERGER WILL BENEFIT BOTH COMPANIES (SEE PAGES 39
AND 56)

     Household believes that the merger will make it more competitive in several
important ways. Household expects the merger to improve its ability to fund the
continued growth of its business. Additionally, Household believes that the
merger will provide it with the ability to create additional product offerings
in the United States targeted to prime and near-prime consumers and to extend
its business into new markets in which HSBC already has a significant presence.

     HSBC believes that the merger creates significant opportunities to
strengthen its business in a way that benefits its shareholders and is
consistent with its strategic objectives. HSBC believes that the merger meets
HSBC's stated objective of growing consumer assets and improves the geographic
balance of HSBC's earnings, significantly increasing the contribution from North
America. By expanding its U.S. consumer finance operations through the merger,
HSBC seeks to add an asset class that further diversifies its portfolio to
offset its potential exposure to increased concentration risk. In addition, HSBC
believes that the merger offers significant opportunities to extend Household's
business model into countries and territories currently served by HSBC and
broadens the product range available to the enlarged customer base. The
combination of the businesses is expected to produce cost savings in the areas
of administrative support and through consolidating card processing. HSBC also
expects that funding costs for the Household business will be lower in the
future as a result of the financial strength and diversity of HSBC. The merger
is expected to be accretive to earnings per share for 2003 on a U.K. GAAP basis.

THERE ARE RISKS THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER IN VOTING ON THE MERGER AGREEMENT,
INCLUDING FACTORS THAT MAY REDUCE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE MERGER (SEE
PAGE 25)

     Although Household and HSBC believe the merger will benefit both companies,
there are risks that you should consider in voting on the merger agreement,
including factors that may reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger for
holders of Household common stock, including that:

     - the value of HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs to be received by holders
       of Household common stock in the merger will fluctuate, and as a result
       of the fixed exchange ratio, holders of Household common stock bear the
       risk of a decline in the market price of HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC
       ADSs;

     - the market value of the HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs to be issued in
       the merger will be subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between
       the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling;

     - the rights of holders of HSBC ADSs to be issued in the merger will not be
       the same as, and may be less favorable than, the rights of holders of
       HSBC ordinary shares to be issued in the merger;

     - the removal of Household from the S&P 500 Index and other market indices
       could result in mutual funds and other investment vehicles selling HSBC
       ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs received in the merger, which could
       adversely affect the market prices for HSBC ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs
       following the merger;

     - shareholders in the United States may decide to sell Household common
       stock and HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs, which could cause a decline
       in their market prices;

     - the opinions, each dated November 14, 2002, obtained by Household from
       its financial advisors will not reflect changes in circumstances between
       the signing of the agreement and the merger, and Household has not
       obtained updated fairness opinions;

     - regulatory requirements or conditions may reduce the anticipated benefits
       of the merger;

     - Household's business, including the business of lending to non-prime
       consumers, involves special legal, regulatory and reputational
       considerations;

     - there are legal actions relating to the merger and Household's prior
       financial disclosures;

     - the merger agreement limits Household's ability to pursue alternatives to
       the merger; and

                                        4
<PAGE>

     - Household's executive officers and directors have interests in the merger
       that are different from your interest as a Household stockholder.

THE HOUSEHOLD BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT HOUSEHOLD STOCKHOLDERS VOTE
"FOR" ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE 39)

     Household's board of directors has determined that the merger agreement and
the merger are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of Household and
its stockholders and has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the
merger and unanimously recommends that Household stockholders vote "FOR"
adoption of the merger agreement. In light of the matters discussed under
"Merger -- Background of the Merger" and on due consideration of the factors
discussed under "Merger -- Household's Reasons for the Merger" the board has
concluded that, notwithstanding Household's recent historical market prices
including a 2002 high of $63.25 per share, the consideration offered by HSBC in
the merger, with an implied value of approximately $30 per share of Household
common stock as of the date of the Household board meeting, is likely to deliver
better value to holders of Household common stock than would be the case in the
foreseeable future in the absence of the merger.

HOLDERS OF HOUSEHOLD NON-VOTING PREFERRED STOCK HAVE APPRAISAL RIGHTS IN THE
MERGER (SEE PAGE 87)

     Holders of Household common stock and Household voting preferred stock do
not have appraisal rights in the merger. Only holders of Household non-voting
preferred stock have statutory appraisal rights in the merger and may perfect
those rights by following in all respects the procedures specified in Section
262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

     To perfect your appraisal rights:

     - you must deliver a written demand for appraisal to Household before the
       vote on the merger is taken at the special meeting and continuously hold
       your shares of record through the completion of the merger; and

     - you, or another dissenting holder, must file a petition with the Delaware
       Court of Chancery within 120 days after the effective date of the merger,
       demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares.

     As a holder of depositary shares each representing an ownership of 1/40th
of a share of a class of Household non-voting preferred stock, if you wish to
exercise and perfect your appraisal rights, you must do so by acting through the
depositary that is the record holder of the shares. You should send a written
notice to the depositary instructing it to take the actions summarized above on
your behalf.

GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. AND KEEFE, BRUYETTE & WOODS, INC. CONSIDER THE MERGER
CONSIDERATION FAIR, FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW, TO HOUSEHOLD COMMON
STOCKHOLDERS AND HOLDERS OF NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK, RESPECTIVELY (SEE
PAGES 42 AND 53)

     Household retained Goldman, Sachs & Co. as its financial advisor in
connection with the merger. In addition, Household retained Keefe, Bruyette &
Woods, Inc. to perform a financial analysis of certain classes of Household's
preferred stock and to render an opinion as to the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the consideration to be received in the merger by the holders
of these classes of preferred stock. Household retained two different financial
advisors in order for the Household board of directors to obtain separate,
independent opinions regarding the fairness, from a financial point of view, of
the consideration to be received in the merger by the holders of Household
common stock, on the one hand, and the holders of this preferred stock, on the
other.

     Goldman Sachs delivered a written opinion to Household's board of directors
that, as of November 14, 2002, and based upon and subject to the factors and
assumptions set forth therein, the exchange ratio of 2.675 HSBC ordinary shares
or 0.535 HSBC ADSs for each share of Household common stock is fair, from a
financial point of view, to holders of Household common stock. Goldman Sachs
will be paid $5 million upon the mailing of this document to Household's
stockholders and will be paid a further $22 million if the merger is completed.

     Keefe, Bruyette & Woods delivered a written opinion to Household's board
that, as of November 14, 2002, and based upon and subject to the factors and
assumptions set forth therein, the consideration to be received by holders of
Household 7 5/8% cumulative preferred stock, 7.50% cumulative preferred stock
and 7.60% cumulative preferred

                                        5
<PAGE>

stock in the merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
Keefe, Bruyette & Woods was paid $333,000 on its retention to render a fairness
opinion, and will be paid an additional $333,000 upon the mailing of this
document to Household's stockholders and a further $334,000 if the merger is
completed.

     Both opinions were provided for the information and assistance of
Household's board of directors in connection with its consideration of the
merger. Neither opinion is a recommendation to any Household stockholder as to
how to vote. The full text of each of the Goldman Sachs opinion and the Keefe,
Bruyette & Woods opinion, which set forth assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations on review undertaken in connection with the
opinions, is attached to this document as Annex B and Annex C, respectively. You
should read both opinions carefully.

     The three series of Household voting preferred stock are being redeemed
pursuant to their terms and the 8 1/4% cumulative preferred stock is being
converted into cash consideration equal to its current redemption price and,
accordingly, no fairness opinion was requested or obtained with respect to these
series of preferred stock.

HOUSEHOLD EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS HAVE INTERESTS IN THE MERGER THAT
DIFFER FROM YOUR INTERESTS IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 59)

     Household's executive officers and directors have economic interests in the
merger in addition to the interest they share with you as a holder of Household
stock. These interests exist because of rights the executive officers have
pursuant to the terms of the equity plans maintained by Household, which provide
for the accelerated vesting of some stock-based awards in connection with
transactions such as the merger. The merger will not result in the accelerated
vesting of any of the stock options to acquire shares of Household common stock
held by the non-employee directors of Household, although these options will
become HSBC stock options in the merger. These interests also exist in the case
of the executive officers, due to the terms of employment agreements with
Household, which provide for severance benefits in the event of qualifying
employment terminations after a change of control. In addition, nine executive
officers of Household have entered into new employment agreements that will
become effective upon the completion of the merger, pursuant to which they will
continue to have senior management positions in Household, will receive payments
under their pre-existing employment agreements with Household, and will receive
compensation including salary, bonus and equity grants from HSBC following the
merger. Pursuant to the terms of these new employment agreements, subject to
satisfaction of the terms and conditions of those agreements, the nine
executives, including Messrs. Aldinger, Schoenholz and Mehta, would be entitled
to receive the following amounts and interests in the aggregate: annual base
salary aggregating $4.9 million per year; annual bonus aggregating approximately
$9.25 million per year; HSBC restricted stock grants with an aggregate grant
date value of $40.5 million vesting in equal annual installments over either a
three-or five-year period. As described in detail on page 63, the approximate
aggregate payments in satisfaction of the cash severance obligations under the
existing employment agreements and employment protection agreements between
Household and each of the nine executives who have entered into new employment
agreements with Household, including Messrs. Aldinger, Schoenholz and Mehta, is
$58 million. Assuming the merger is completed on March 31, 2003, the number of
stock options to acquire shares of Household common stock held by the nine
executives who have entered into new employment agreements with Household,
including Messrs. Aldinger, Schoenholz and Mehta, that will vest and become
exercisable as a result of the merger is 2,023,125 in the aggregate, which
options have an in-the-money value of $0, based on the closing price per share
of Household common stock on February 25, 2003. Assuming the merger is completed
on March 31, 2003, the number of Household restricted stock rights held by the
nine executives, including Messrs. Aldinger, Schoenholz and Mehta, that will
vest and become free of restrictions as a result of the merger is 461,008 in the
aggregate, which restricted stock rights have a value of approximately $12.7
million in the aggregate, based on the closing price per share of Household
common stock on February 25, 2003.

     Following the merger, Mr. Aldinger, the current chairman and chief
executive officer of Household, will continue to serve as chairman and chief
executive officer of Household until January 1, 2004 and thereafter as chairman
and chief executive officer of Household and HSBC North America, Inc. Mr.
Aldinger will also serve as a member of the

HSBC board of directors. Following the merger, Mr. Schoenholz will continue to
serve as Household's president and chief operating officer, and Mr. Mehta will
continue to serve as a group executive of Household. As described in detail
beginning on page 59, there are substantial financial interests to be conveyed
to the executive officers of Household, including Messrs. Aldinger, Schoenholz
and Mehta, under either the terms of existing or new employment agreements and
due to the accelerated vesting of stock options and restricted stock rights in
respect of Household common stock.

     Pursuant to the terms of the new employment agreements with each of Messrs.
Aldinger, Schoenholz and Mehta, subject to satisfaction of the terms and
conditions of those agreements, each of these executives would be entitled to
receive the following amounts and interests:

     - Mr. Aldinger: annual base salary of $1 million; annual bonus of $4
       million; a special retention grant of HSBC restricted stock with a grant
       date value of $10 million vesting in three equal annual installments; two
       subsequent annual grants of HSBC restricted shares each with a grant date
       value of $5.5 million vesting in three equal annual installments.

     - Mr. Schoenholz: annual base salary of $650,000; annual bonus of $1.5
       million; a special retention grant of HSBC restricted stock with a grant
       date value of $3 million vesting in three equal annual installments.

     - Mr. Mehta: annual base salary of $550,000; annual bonus of $1.125
       million; a special retention grant of HSBC restricted stock with a grant
       date value of $5 million vesting in five equal annual installments.

     As described in detail on page 63, the approximate payment in satisfaction
of the cash severance obligations under the existing employment agreements
between Household and each of Messrs. Aldinger, Schoenholz and Mehta is $20.30
million, $10.64 million and $8.60 million, respectively. Assuming the merger is
completed on March 31, 2003, the number of stock options to acquire shares of
Household common stock held by each of Messrs. Aldinger, Schoenholz and Mehta
that will vest and become exercisable as a result of the merger is 1,015,000,
256,000 and 256,000, respectively, which options have an in-the-money value of
$0, based on the closing price per share of Household common stock on February
25, 2003. Assuming the merger is completed on March 31, 2003, the number of
Household restricted stock rights held by each of Messrs. Aldinger, Schoenholz
and Mehta that will vest and become free of restrictions as a result of the
merger is 134,420, 84,012 and 84,012, respectively, which restricted stock
rights have a value of approximately $3.7 million, $2.3 million and $2.3
million, respectively, based on the closing price per share of Household common
stock on February 25, 2003.

     Following the merger, HSBC has agreed that Household will continue to be
obligated to indemnify and will continue to maintain directors' and officers'
insurance covering the officers and directors of Household relating to events
occurring before completion of the merger.

HSBC WILL ASSUME HOUSEHOLD STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER EQUITY AWARDS (SEE PAGES 64
AND 78)

     When HSBC and Household complete the merger, outstanding options to
purchase, and other equity-based awards in respect of, shares of Household
common stock, granted to Household employees and directors under Household's
equity-based plans, will be assumed by HSBC and become options to purchase and
awards in respect of HSBC ordinary shares. The number of shares subject to these
options and awards, and the exercise price of the options, will be adjusted to
reflect the exchange ratio. Options and awards that have not previously vested
will vest upon completion of the merger, except for options and awards granted
after November 14, 2002. Assuming the merger is completed on March 31, 2003,
options to acquire an aggregate of 2,143,125 shares of Household common stock
held by Household's executive officers will vest and become exercisable as a
result of the merger, which options have a weighted average exercise price of
$53.44, and an aggregate of 526,750 Household restricted stock rights held by
Household's executive officers will vest and become free of restrictions as a
result of the merger.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS ATTACHED (SEE PAGE 75 AND ANNEX A)

HOLDERS OF HOUSEHOLD COMMON STOCK AND SOME HOLDERS OF HOUSEHOLD PREFERRED STOCK
CAN VOTE ON THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 33)

     The holders of record of Household common stock and voting preferred stock,
as of the close of business on February 21, 2003, which is the record date for
the special meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the
special meeting.

     The holders of Household non-voting preferred stock are entitled to receive
notice of, but are not entitled to vote at, the special meeting.

A MAJORITY VOTE OF HOUSEHOLD STOCKHOLDERS IS REQUIRED TO ADOPT THE MERGER
AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE 33)

     The adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Household stock entitled to
vote, voting together as a single class. Each share of common stock and each
share of voting preferred stock is entitled to one vote. Failure to grant your
proxy by telephone or on the Internet, to return a properly executed proxy card
or to vote in person at the special meeting will have the same effect as a vote
"AGAINST" adoption of the merger agreement (except that shares of Household
common stock credited to an account under the Household International Tax
Reduction Investment Plan for which voting instructions are not received will be
voted by the plan's trustee in the same way as the majority of the shares held
under the plan for which voting instructions are received).

A MAJORITY VOTE OF HSBC ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE MERGER
(SEE PAGE 36)

     At an extraordinary general meeting of HSBC shareholders expected to occur

will vote on a resolution to approve the merger and authorize the directors of
HBSC to allot the necessary HSBC ordinary shares to be issued in connection with
the merger.

     The merger is conditioned on approval of the resolution, which will require
the approval of a majority of the votes cast on a show of hands or on a poll at
the HSBC extraordinary general meeting. On a show of hands every HSBC ordinary
shareholder who is present in person, including corporate representatives of
corporate shareholders, is entitled to one vote. On a poll, every HSBC ordinary
shareholder who is present in person, including corporate representatives of
corporate shareholders, or by proxy is entitled to one vote for each HSBC
ordinary share held.

THERE ARE CONDITIONS THAT MUST BE SATISFIED OR WAIVED BEFORE HSBC AND HOUSEHOLD
ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 83)

                                        8
<PAGE>

     - Household having performed in all material respects all obligations
       required to be performed by it under the merger agreement,

     - HSBC having received a tax opinion from Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &
       Hamilton, to the effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization
       within the meaning of the U.S. tax code and that each transfer of
       property to HSBC by a stockholder of Household pursuant to the merger
       will not be subject to Section 367(a)(1) of the U.S. tax code,

       on HSBC or Household.

     In addition, Household is not required to complete the merger unless a

MUST BE OBTAINED PRIOR TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 68)

     In the United States, the merger is subject to the prior notification
requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act, which requires
its impact on competition to be reviewed in advance by the Department of Justice
or the Federal Trade Commission. The required waiting period has been
terminated.

     The change in control of some Household subsidiaries will also be subject
to regulatory approval, including by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of
New York and the state banking authorities in some other states, some state
insurance departments, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

     Filings with regulatory authorities will also be required or advisable in
other countries in which Household operates, including the United Kingdom, the
Republic of Ireland and Canada.

UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES HOUSEHOLD WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY A TERMINATION FEE TO

     The information listed as "equivalent pro forma" for Household was obtained
by multiplying the HSBC pro forma amounts under U.K. GAAP by the exchange ratio
of 2.675 HSBC ordinary shares for each share of Household common stock.

     The pro forma information is not indicative of the results of future
operations or the actual results that would have been incurred had the merger
been consummated at the beginning of the periods presented. You should read the
data presented below together with the historical consolidated financial
statements, including the related notes, of HSBC and Household that are

SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA

  HSBC

     HSBC prepares its financial statements in accordance with U.K. generally
accepted accounting principles, or U.K. GAAP. It uses the U.S. dollar as its
reporting currency because the U.S. dollar and currencies linked to it form the
major currency bloc in which HSBC transacts its business. In connection with its
listing on the New York Stock Exchange, HSBC also reconciles financial
information to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP,
which differ in some respects from U.K. GAAP, as described in "HSBC and
Household Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information." Except
as otherwise specifically noted, all financial information for HSBC contained in
this document has been prepared in accordance with U.K. GAAP.

     The selected financial information which is set forth below as of and for
the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 has been derived from and
should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and statistics or
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of HSBC and its subsidiaries
as set forth in HSBC's annual report on Form 20-F/A for the year ended December
31, 2001. The consolidated financial statements of HSBC as of December 31, 1997,
1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 and for each of the years in the five-year period
ended December 31, 2001 have been audited by KPMG Audit Plc, chartered
accountants and registered auditor. The selected information which is set forth
below as of and for the year ended December 31, 2001 has been restated to
reflect the adoption of U.K. Financial Reporting Standard 19 "Deferred Tax," and
together with the selected financial information which is set forth below as of
and for the six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2002 is unaudited and should be
read in conjunction with HSBC's report on Form 6-K, dated August 5, 2002,
containing interim financial information for the six months ended June 30, 2001

HOUSEHOLD

     The selected financial information which is set forth below as of and for
the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 has been derived
from and should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and
statistics or consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Household
and its subsidiaries as set forth in Household's annual report on Form 10-K/A,
for the year ended December 31, 2001. The consolidated financial statements of
Household as of December 31, 2000 and 2001, and for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2001, have been audited by KPMG LLP,
Household's independent certified public accountants.

     The selected financial information which is set forth below as of and for
the six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2002 is unaudited and should be read in
conjunction with Household's quarterly report on Form 10-Q/A, for the quarter
ended June 30, 2002, which is incorporated by reference herein. Operating
results for the six months ended June 30, 2002 should not be considered
indicative of the results for any future quarters or the year ending December
31, 2002.

     For the three months ended September 30, 2002, Household recorded a $525
million pre-tax charge related to Household's agreement in principle with a
multi-state working group of state attorneys general and regulatory agencies to
effect a nationwide resolution of alleged violations of federal and state
consumer protection, consumer finance and banking laws and regulations related
to real estate secured lending from its retail branch consumer lending
operations as operated under the "HFC" and "Beneficial" brand names. Please
refer to Household's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended
September 30, 2002 for further information. This agreement became effective on
December 16, 2002. Consent decrees or similar documentation have been entered
into with all 50 states and the District of Columbia. On October 11, 2002,
Household announced that it had determined that the continued operation of
Household Bank, f.s.b. was not in Household's long-term strategic interest.
During the fourth quarter of 2002, Household completed the sale of substantially
all of the remaining assets and deposits of Household Bank, f.s.b. A loss of
$240 million (after-tax) was recorded on the disposition of these assets and
deposits.

     In October 2002, Household issued 18.7 million shares of common stock for
$400 million and $542 million of 8.875% Adjustable Conversion-Rate Equity
Security Units, or Units. Each Unit consists of both a purchase contract, under
which the purchaser will agree to purchase from Household, for $25 each, shares
of common stock of Household on February 15, 2006, and an 8.875% senior note due
February 15, 2008.

     Household's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP.

    relating to the June 30, 1998 merger with Beneficial Corporation, or
    Beneficial, and the $118.5 million after-tax gain on the sale of
    Beneficial's Canadian operations, net operating income was $1,114.3 million,
    the return on average owned assets was 2.22%, the return on average common
    shareholders' equity was 17.9%, the common dividend payout ratio was 27.1%
    and the return on average managed assets was 1.54%. This non-GAAP financial
    information is being provided for comparison of our operating trends and
    should be read in conjunction with our GAAP financial information.

(2) The ratios of common and preferred equity and trust preferred securities as
    a percentage of owned and managed assets are non-GAAP financial ratios that
    are used by rating agencies as a measure to evaluate capital adequacy. These
    ratios may differ from similarly named measures presented by other
    companies. Because of their long-term nature and Household's ability to
    defer dividends, rating agencies consider trust preferred securities as
    equity in calculating these ratios.

(3) Household monitors its operations and evaluates trends on both an owned
    basis as shown in its historical financial statements and on a managed
    basis, which is a non-GAAP basis. Managed basis reporting adjustments assume
    that securitized receivables have not been sold and are still on Household's
    balance sheet. Managed basis information is intended to supplement, and
    should not be considered a substitute for, owned basis reporting and should
    be read in conjunction with reported owned basis results.

UNAUDITED SELECTED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     HSBC has reached an agreement to acquire Household in accordance with the
terms of a merger agreement entered into on November 14, 2002 between HSBC, H2
(a wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC) and Household. Under the terms of the merger
agreement, Household will be merged with and into H2. Following the acquisition,
H2 will remain a wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC but will be renamed Household
International, Inc.

     Holders of Household common stock will be entitled to receive, at their
election for each share of Household common stock, 2.675 HSBC ordinary shares or
0.535 HSBC ADSs, each HSBC ADS representing 5 HSBC ordinary shares. All the
outstanding Household non-voting preferred stock will be converted into a right
to receive from HSBC cash in the aggregate amount of approximately U.S.$1,100
million, together with accrued but unpaid dividends. In addition, all the
outstanding Household voting preferred stock will be designated for redemption
effective prior to the merger and Household will deposit the applicable
redemption price in trust for the holders of these shares under the terms of the
instruments governing their shares.

     HSBC and Household are providing the following unaudited selected pro forma
condensed combined financial information to illustrate the impact of the merger
on the companies' historical financial positions and results of operations under
the acquisition method of accounting under U.K. GAAP. In addition, we also are
providing financial information on a U.S. GAAP basis.

     For a more detailed explanation of this analysis, please refer to "HSBC and
Household Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information."

     The unaudited selected pro forma financial information is presented for
illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what the
operating results or the financial position of the combined company would have
been had the merger occurred on the respective dates assumed and is not
necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial position of the
combined company.

     The unaudited selected pro forma financial information for the year ended
December 31, 2001 and as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2002 is
presented on a U.K. GAAP basis and combines the following:

     - HSBC's historical financial information for the year ended December 31,
       2001 (as restated following implementation of U.K. Financial Reporting
       Standard (FRS) 19 "Deferred Tax") and as of and for the six months ended
       June 30, 2002.

     - Household's historical financial information on a U.S. GAAP basis for the
       year ended December 31, 2001 and as of and for the six months ended June
       30, 2002, adjusted to conform with HSBC's accounting policies under U.K.
       GAAP.

     - Adjustments to give effect to capital security transactions of Household
       subsequent to June 30, 2002.

     - Pro forma adjustments related to acquisition accounting utilizing the
       respective fair values of Household's assets and liabilities as of June
       30, 2002.

     The unaudited selected pro forma consolidated combined balance sheet
information as of June 30, 2002 assumes the merger was consummated on that date.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income information for
the six months ended June 30, 2002 and for the year ended December 31, 2001 give
effect to the merger as if the merger had been consummated on January 1, 2001,
the first day of the earliest financial period presented.

     The unaudited selected pro forma financial information is based on, and
derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the historical
consolidated financial statements and related notes of HSBC and Household,
incorporated by reference in this document. Please refer to "Where You Can Find
More Information".

ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING

     HSBC intends to account for the merger using acquisition accounting under
U.K. GAAP. Under this method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of
Household will be recorded, as of the completion date of the merger, at their
respective fair values and added to those of HSBC. Financial statements and
reported results of operations of HSBC issued after consummation of the merger
will reflect these values, but prior HSBC financial statements will not be
restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results
of operations of Household.

     All unaudited selected pro forma financial information contained in this
document has been prepared using the acquisition method to account for the
merger. Under U.K. GAAP, the final determination of the purchase price is based
on the price of HSBC ordinary shares as of the date the merger is completed. In
addition, the final allocation of the purchase price will be determined after
completion of a thorough analysis to determine the fair values of Household's
assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting
adjustments and goodwill may be materially different from those reflected in the
unaudited selected pro forma information presented in this document.

     HSBC judges its performance by comparing cash returns on cash invested,
which is a non-GAAP measure. Cash basis items are derived by adjusting reported
earnings to eliminate the impact of the amortization of goodwill arising on
acquisitions.

                      RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE MERGER

     In addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by
reference into this document, you should carefully consider the following risk
factors in deciding whether to vote in favor of the merger. Please also refer to
the additional risk factors identified in the periodic reports and other
documents of HSBC and Household incorporated by reference into this document and
listed in "Where You Can Find More Information."

THE VALUE OF HSBC ORDINARY SHARES OR HSBC ADSS TO BE RECEIVED BY HOLDERS OF
HOUSEHOLD COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER WILL FLUCTUATE

     Upon completion of the merger, each share of Household common stock will be
exchanged for, at the election of the holder, either 2.675 HSBC ordinary shares
or 0.535 HSBC ADSs. There will be no adjustment to the exchange ratio for
changes in the market price of either Household common stock or HSBC ordinary
shares or HSBC ADSs. Accordingly, the market value of the HSBC ordinary shares
or HSBC ADSs that holders of Household common stock will become entitled to
receive upon completion of the merger will depend on the market value of HSBC
ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs at the time of completion of the merger and could
vary significantly from the market value on the date of this document or the
date of the Household special meeting. The market value of the HSBC ordinary
shares or HSBC ADSs to be received in the merger will also continue to fluctuate
after completion of the merger. For historical and current market prices of HSBC
ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs, please refer to "Market Price and Dividend Data."
You should obtain current market quotations for HSBC ordinary shares and HSBC
ADSs and for Household common stock.

THE MARKET VALUE OF THE HSBC ORDINARY SHARES OR HSBC ADSS TO BE ISSUED IN THE
MERGER WILL BE SUBJECT TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS

     Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the pound
sterling will affect the dollar equivalent of the pound sterling price of HSBC
ordinary shares traded on the London Stock Exchange, or LSE, and, as a result,
are likely to affect the market price of the HSBC ADSs traded on the New York
Stock Exchange, or NYSE.

THE RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF HSBC ADSS TO BE ISSUED IN THE MERGER WILL NOT BE THE
SAME AS THE RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF HSBC ORDINARY SHARES TO BE ISSUED IN THE MERGER

     The rights and terms of the HSBC ADSs are designed to replicate, to the
extent reasonably practicable, the rights attendant to HSBC ordinary shares, for
which there is no active trading market in the United States. However, because
of aspects of U.K. law, HSBC's Memorandum and Articles of Association and the
contractual terms of the deposit agreement under which the HSBC ADSs are issued,
the rights of holders of HSBC ADSs are not identical to, and, in some respects,
are less favorable than, the rights of holders of HSBC ordinary shares. For more
information regarding the characteristics of, and differences between, HSBC
ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs, please refer to "Description of HSBC Ordinary
Shares" and "Description of HSBC American Depositary Shares."

THE REMOVAL OF HOUSEHOLD FROM THE S&P 500 INDEX AND OTHER MARKET INDICES COULD
RESULT IN MUTUAL FUNDS AND OTHER INVESTMENT VEHICLES SELLING HSBC ORDINARY
SHARES AND HSBC ADSS RECEIVED IN THE MERGER

     Household common stock is presently included in the S&P 500 Index, the
Russell 3000 Index, the Russell 1000 Index, the Wilshire 5000 Index and 31 other
market indices. Goldman Sachs has estimated that mutual funds and other
investment vehicles whose investment objective is to track the performance of
these market indices may currently hold 14.2% of the outstanding shares of
Household common stock. These funds may be required to sell the HSBC ordinary
shares or HSBC ADSs they receive in the merger because HSBC is not, and is not
expected to be, included in these market indices. These sales could adversely
affect the market price for HSBC ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs following the
merger.

SHAREHOLDERS IN THE UNITED STATES MAY DECIDE TO SELL HOUSEHOLD COMMON STOCK AND
HSBC ORDINARY SHARES OR HSBC ADSS, WHICH COULD CAUSE A DECLINE IN THEIR MARKET
PRICES

     U.S. holders of Household common stock may be disinclined to own shares of
companies that have their primary listing outside the United States. This,
combined with the removal of Household from the S&P 500 Index, as described
above, could result in the sale of HSBC ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs received
in the merger, some of which will end up being held by U.K. and other non-U.S.
investors (such sales being referred to as "flowback"). Goldman Sachs has
estimated, based on assumptions set forth below in this document, that 61.3% of
the HSBC ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs received by holders of shares of
Household common stock in the merger may be sold as a result of the transaction.
These sales could adversely affect the market price for HSBC ordinary shares and
HSBC ADSs following the merger. Please refer to "The Merger -- Opinion of
Household's Financial Advisor Relating to Common Stock -- Flowback Analysis."

THE OPINIONS, EACH DATED NOVEMBER 14, 2002, OBTAINED BY HOUSEHOLD FROM ITS
FINANCIAL ADVISORS WILL NOT REFLECT CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES BETWEEN THE SIGNING
OF THE AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER

     Household has not obtained updated opinions from Goldman, Sachs & Co. and
Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., Household's financial advisors, as of the date of
this document based on its belief that there have been no changes in
circumstances since delivery of the November 14 opinions that necessitate
updated opinions, particularly in view of the fact that the opinions were only
one of several factors considered by Household's board of directors in
determining to approve the merger, and that the then current trading prices for
shares of Household stock and HSBC ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs were only one
of several factors considered by Household's financial advisors in rendering
their fairness opinions. However, changes in the operations and prospects of
HSBC or Household, general market and economic conditions and other factors
which are beyond the control of HSBC and Household, and on which the November
14, 2002 written opinion of Goldman Sachs and the November 14, 2002 written
opinion of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods are based, may alter the value of HSBC or
Household or the prices of HSBC ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs and Household
common and preferred stock by the time the merger is completed. As a result of
the foregoing, holders of Household's common stock, 7 5/8% cumulative preferred
stock, 7.50% cumulative preferred stock and 7.60% cumulative preferred stock
should be aware that the opinions of Goldman Sachs and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods
do not speak as of the time the merger will be completed or as of any date other
than November 14, 2002. For a description of the opinions that Household
received from its financial advisors, please refer to "The Merger -- Opinion of
Household's Financial Advisor Relating to Common Stock" and "The
Merger -- Opinion of Household's Financial Advisor Relating to Non-Redeemable
Preferred Stock." For a description of the other factors considered by
Household's board of directors in determining to approve the merger, please
refer to "The Merger -- Household's Reasons for the Merger."

HSBC HAS NOT QUANTIFIED THE COST SYNERGIES AND REVENUE ENHANCEMENTS EXPECTED TO
RESULT FROM, AND MAY FAIL TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF, THE MERGER

     HSBC and Household entered into the merger agreement with the expectation
that the merger would result in significant cost synergies and revenue
enhancements from additional business opportunities; however, HSBC has not
attempted to quantify these expected cost synergies and revenue enhancements.
HSBC and Household believe that the merger will result in a lower cost of
funding for Household and increased cost savings in the areas of administrative
support and information technology and through consolidating card processing. In
addition, the merger offers significant opportunities to capture new customer
business for both companies, to market products to each other's customers, to
migrate customers from Household to HSBC as their financial circumstances
improve and to link Household's Hispanic customer base with HSBC's Mexican
banking network, and HSBC's Mexican banking network, including the recently
acquired Grupo Financiero Bital S.A. de C.V., with Household's consumer finance
capabilities for qualifying emigrants.

     HSBC may fail to realize some or all of the benefits of these cost savings
as a result of, among other things, Household's failing to benefit from HSBC's
lower funding costs, the failure successfully to consolidate HSBC's North
American card processing business with Household's or to expand Household's
credit card platforms across wider geographic markets or the continued
duplication of administrative functions. HSBC

                                        26
<PAGE>

also may fail to realize some or all of the benefits of new business
opportunities because, among other reasons, it is unable fully to take advantage
of cross-selling opportunities, its marketing efforts are unsuccessful or it
fails to provide an effective infrastructure for linking customers to networks
or retaining customers. Despite Household's experience in forecasting credit
risks and costs, HSBC may also fail to realize some of the benefits of the
merger if the U.S. economy and consumer credit levels significantly deteriorate.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR CONDITIONS MAY REDUCE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE
MERGER

     As a result of the merger, Household's subsidiaries will become subject to
examination by and the supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, or the FRB. They will also become subject to the requirements of
the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or the BHCA, which generally
limit the activities in which a financial holding company such as HSBC may
directly or indirectly engage in the United States to those that are "financial
in nature." As of the second anniversary of the merger, any Household subsidiary
engaged in any activity that has not been determined by the FRB to be financial
in nature will have to divest such activity unless it otherwise qualifies for an
exemption under the BHCA. For example, Household currently owns companies or
assets on which it previously foreclosed that are engaged in or involve
activities that are not financial in nature. While none of these businesses is
material to Household or the combined company, as of the second anniversary of
the merger, any such activities may need to be divested. In addition, one or
more of the various banking, consumer finance, insurance and other regulatory
agencies whose approvals are required in connection with the merger may impose
conditions on such approvals. Such requirements or conditions could have an
adverse effect on HSBC or reduce the potential benefits of the merger.

HOUSEHOLD'S BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE BUSINESS OF LENDING TO THE NON-PRIME
CONSUMER MARKET, INVOLVES SPECIAL LEGAL, REGULATORY AND REPUTATIONAL
CONSIDERATIONS

     Household is considered to be a lender to the non-prime consumer market as
these consumers account for approximately 37% of Household's receivables on a
managed basis. Non-prime consumers are individuals who have limited credit
histories, modest income, high debt-to-income ratios or have experienced credit
problems caused by occasional delinquencies, prior charge-offs or other credit
related actions. These consumers generally have higher delinquency and credit
loss probabilities and are charged a higher interest rate to compensate for the
additional risk and for where the loan is not adequately collateralized to
mitigate the risk of loss. The major participants in the business of lending to
non-prime consumers, including Household and its principal competitors, have
been subject to litigation, adverse publicity and regulatory scrutiny involving
allegations of improper practices, including alleged violations of federal and
state consumer protection, consumer finance and banking laws and regulations.
Also, Household has been named in purported class actions by individuals and
consumer groups (such as AARP and ACORN) claiming that its loan products or its
lending policies and practices are unfair or misleading to consumers.

     On October 11, 2002, Household announced that it had reached a preliminary
agreement with a multi-state working group of state attorneys general and
regulatory agencies to effect a nationwide resolution of alleged violations of
law relating to real estate secured lending from its retail branch consumer
lending operations. The preliminary agreement became effective as of December
16, 2002. Consent decrees or similar documentation have now been entered into
with all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Under the settlement, Household
has committed to make changes to some of its lending practices, including
providing greater disclosures and alternatives for customers in connection with
non-prime mortgage lending originated by its retail branch network and amending
all branch-originated real estate secured loans to provide that no prepayment
penalty is payable later than 24 months after origination. The settlement
required Household to establish a fund of $484 million to be divided among all
participating states (including the District of Columbia), with each state
receiving a proportionate share based upon the volume of the retail branch
originated real estate secured loans made by Household in that state during the
period of January 1, 1999 through September 30, 2002. Household agreed to
deposit these monies into the fund in three equal installments. On January 15,
2003 and February 14, 2003, Household made the first two deposits and will make
the remaining deposit on March 17, 2003. Household has also paid $10.2 million
to the states as

                                        27
<PAGE>

reimbursement for the expenses of their investigation and will pay $9.8 million
of the fees and expenses of an independent administrator. At its expense,
Household will also retain an independent monitor to report on Household's
compliance with the settlement over the next five years. The various commitments
regarding its business practices that Household has made in connection with the
multi-state settlement are described in greater detail in Household's Current
Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 15, 2002. See "Where You Can
Find More Information."

     Although each consumer that receives a payment under the settlement must
release Household from all civil claims relating to its consumer lending
practices, the settlement itself does not cause the immediate dismissal of
purported class actions seeking redress for any claims covered by the settlement
and there can be no assurance that all plaintiffs and potential plaintiffs will
participate in the settlement. Also, Household expects that various consumer
groups, including those that have brought purported class actions against
Household in the past, will continue to target Household in the media and with
legal actions in an effort to effect additional changes to the non-prime
mortgage lending industry.

LEGAL ACTIONS RELATING TO THE MERGER AND HOUSEHOLD'S PRIOR FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES

     Several derivative and/or purported class action lawsuits have been filed
against Household and various of its directors and officers alleging violations
of fiduciary duty and corporate waste with respect to the merger. Some of these
lawsuits seek to enjoin the merger. While these lawsuits are in their
preliminary stages and Household intends to defend them vigorously, there can be
no assurance that the outcome of these lawsuits will be favorable to Household.
Please refer to "The Merger -- Litigation Relating to the Merger."

     In connection with Household's restatement of its prior period financial
results in August 2002 and other disclosure matters, Household, its directors,
some officers and former auditors have been subjected to various legal actions
and proceedings, including several purported class action lawsuits, alleging
violations of the federal securities laws. Although Household believes that its
officers and directors have not committed any wrongdoing and that there will be
no resulting material liability to Household or any of its officers and
directors, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these actions
and proceedings.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT LIMITS HOUSEHOLD'S ABILITY TO PURSUE ALTERNATIVES TO THE
MERGER

     The merger agreement contains "no shop" provisions that, subject to limited
exceptions, limit Household's ability to discuss, facilitate or commit to
competing third-party proposals to acquire all or a significant part of the
company. Further, there are only limited exceptions to Household's agreement
that Household's board of directors will not withdraw or modify in a way adverse
to HSBC its recommendation to Household stockholders that they vote in favor of
the merger, or recommend any other acquisition proposal. Although Household's
board of directors is permitted to take these actions if it determines that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, doing so would
entitle HSBC to terminate the merger agreement and to receive a termination fee
of $550 million. Also, in some situations where a competing acquisition proposal
has been made known to Household or its stockholders and the merger agreement is
subsequently terminated for a variety of reasons (including because Household
stockholders fail to approve the merger or because Household, as permitted by
the merger agreement, engages in discussions with a competing acquiror that are
not terminated within 20 days), Household is required to pay HSBC a termination
fee of $550 million if Household completes, or enters into an agreement for, an
alternative acquisition transaction during the 12 months after the termination.
See "The Merger Agreement -- No Solicitation," "-- Termination, Amendment and
Waiver" and "-- Fees and Expenses."

     HSBC required Household to agree to these provisions as a condition to
HSBC's willingness to enter into the merger agreement. However, these provisions
might discourage a potential competing acquiror that might have an interest in
acquiring all or a significant part of Household from considering or proposing
that acquisition even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per
share market price than that proposed in the merger, or might result in a
potential competing acquiror proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire
Household than it might otherwise have proposed to pay as a result of the
termination fee.

HOUSEHOLD'S EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS HAVE INTERESTS IN THE MERGER THAT
ARE DIFFERENT FROM YOUR INTEREST AS A HOUSEHOLD STOCKHOLDER

     The merger agreement was negotiated with HSBC by executive officers of
Household. It has been approved by Household's board of directors, which is
recommending that Household stockholders vote in favor of the merger agreement.
In considering these facts and the other information contained in this document,
you should be aware that Household's executive officers and directors have
economic interests in the merger in addition to the interest that they share
with you of being a holder of Household stock. As described in detail below,
there are substantial financial interests to be conveyed to each executive
officer of Household, including Messrs. Aldinger, Schoenholz and Mehta, under
either the terms of existing or new employment agreements and due to the
accelerated vesting of stock options and restricted stock rights in respect of
Household common stock. For instance, some of the stock options and shares of
restricted stock will vest as a result of the merger, and Household stock
options will become HSBC stock options in the merger. Nine executive officers,
including Mr. Aldinger, have entered into new employment agreements with
Household that will become effective when the merger is completed, under which
they will continue to have senior management positions in Household, will
receive payments and benefits under their pre-existing employment agreements
with Household, and will receive compensation including salary, bonus and equity
grants from HSBC following the merger. Mr. Aldinger will also become a member of
the HSBC board of directors following the merger. Pursuant to the terms of these
new employment agreements, subject to satisfaction of the terms and conditions
of those agreements, the nine executives, including Messrs. Aldinger, Schoenholz
and Mehta, would be entitled to receive the following amounts and interests in
the aggregate: annual base salary aggregating $4.9 million per year; annual
bonus aggregating approximately $9.25 million per year; HSBC restricted stock
grants with an aggregate grant date value of $40.5 million vesting in equal
annual installments over either a three or five year period. As described in
detail on page 63, the approximate payment in satisfaction of the cash severance
obligations under the existing employment agreements and employment protection
agreements between Household and each of the nine executives who have entered
into new employment agreements with Household, including Messrs. Aldinger,
Schoenholz and Mehta, is $58 million. Assuming the merger is completed on March
31, 2003, the number of stock options to acquire shares of Household common
stock held by the nine executives who have entered into new employment
agreements with Household, including Messrs. Aldinger, Schoenholz and Mehta,
that will vest and become exercisable as a result of the merger is 2,023,125 in
the aggregate, which options have an in-the-money value of $0, based on the
closing price per share of Household common stock on February 25, 2003. Assuming
the merger is completed on March 31, 2003, the number of Household restricted
stock rights held by the nine executives, including Messrs. Aldinger, Schoenholz
and Mehta, that will vest and become free of restrictions as a result of the
merger is 461,008 in the aggregate, which restricted stock rights have a value
of approximately $12.7 million in the aggregate, based on the closing price per
share of Household common stock on February 25, 2003. The merger will not result
in the accelerated vesting of any of the stock options to acquire shares of
Household common stock held by the non-employee directors of Household, although
these options will become HSBC stock options in the merger. Following the
merger, HSBC has agreed that Household will, subject to specified cost
restrictions, maintain directors' and officers' insurance for a six-year period
following completion of the merger covering the directors and officers of
Household relating to events occurring before completion of the merger. For
additional information about these interests, please see "The
Merger -- Interests of Household's Executive Officers and Directors in the
Merger."

                              RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

     On January 15, 2003, Household announced its 2002 fourth-quarter and
full-year earnings. Household's fourth-quarter net income totaled $338.2
million, or $.66 per diluted share. For the full year, Household's net income
totaled $1.6 billion, or $3.22 per diluted share. In 2002, Household incurred a
$333.2 million, after-tax, non-recurring charge relating to its nationwide
settlement with state attorneys general and other regulators in the third
quarter and a $240.0 million after-tax loss on the disposition of the assets and
deposits of Household Bank, f.s.b. (the "Thrift") in the fourth quarter.
Excluding these non-recurring charges, Household would have earned $578.2
million in the fourth quarter and $2.1 billion for the full year. For further
detail on Household's 2002 fourth-quarter and full-year earnings, please refer
to Household's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 16,
2003, which you can obtain as described under "Where You Can Find More

(1) Household monitors its operations and evaluates trends on both an owned
    basis as shown in its historical financial statements and on a managed
    basis, which is a non-GAAP basis. Managed basis reporting adjustments assume
    that securitized receivables have not been sold and are still on Household's

                 THE SPECIAL MEETING OF HOUSEHOLD STOCKHOLDERS

TIME, PLACE AND PURPOSE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

     The special meeting will be held at Household International, Inc., 2700
Sanders Road, Prospect Heights, Illinois, on March 28, 2003, at 10:00 a.m. local
time. The purpose of the special meeting is to consider and vote on the proposal
to adopt the merger agreement and to consider any other matters that may
properly come before the Household special meeting.

     Household's board of directors has unanimously determined that the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including
the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Household and
its stockholders, unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement and unanimously recommends that Household
stockholders vote "FOR" adoption of the merger agreement.

WHO CAN VOTE AT THE SPECIAL MEETING

     The holders of record of Household common stock and Household voting
preferred stock as of the close of business on February 21, 2003, which is the
record date for the special meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to
vote, together as a single class, at the special meeting. Holders of Household
non-voting preferred stock are entitled to notice of, but are not entitled to
vote at, the special meeting.

     If you own shares that are registered in someone else's name, for example,
in the name of a broker, you need to direct that person to vote those shares or
obtain an authorization from that person and vote those shares yourself at the
meeting. On the record date, there were 473,664,080 shares of Household common
stock outstanding held by approximately 16,430 stockholders of record, as well
as 407,718 shares of 5% cumulative preferred stock, 103,976 shares of $4.50
cumulative preferred stock and 836,585 shares of $4.30 cumulative preferred
stock outstanding held by approximately 1,103, 208 and 464 stockholders of
record, respectively. The approximate number of holders of Household common
stock was determined by adding the number of record holders to the estimated
number of proxies to be sent to street name holders.

VOTE REQUIRED

     The adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Household common stock and
Household voting preferred stock entitled to vote on the merger, voting together
as a single class. Each holder of a share of Household common stock and voting
preferred stock is entitled to one vote per share. Failure to grant your proxy
by telephone or on the Internet, to return a properly executed proxy card or to
vote in person will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" adoption of the
merger agreement (except that shares of Household common stock credited to an
account under the Household International Tax Reduction Investment Plan for
which voting instructions are not received will be voted by the plan's trustee
in the same way as the majority of the shares held under the plan for which
voting instructions are received).

     Under the rules of the NYSE, brokers who hold shares of stock in street
names for customers have the authority to vote those shares in their discretion
on "routine" proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial
owners. However, brokers are precluded from exercising their voting discretion
with respect to the approval of non-routine matters such as adoption of the
merger agreement and, as a result, absent specific instructions from the
beneficial owner of such shares, brokers are not empowered to vote those shares.
Shares of stock held by brokers for customers who have not provided such voting
instructions on a matter are referred to generally as "broker non-votes."
Abstentions and properly executed broker non-votes will be treated as shares of
stock that are present and entitled to vote at the special meeting for purposes
of determining whether a quorum exists and will have the same effect as votes
"AGAINST" adoption of the merger agreement.

     The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Household common
stock and voting preferred stock, taken together as a single class, entitled to
be cast as of the record date, represented in person or by

                                        33
<PAGE>

proxy, will constitute a quorum for purposes of the special meeting. A quorum is
necessary to hold the special meeting.

HOW YOU CAN VOTE

     Each holder of shares of Household common stock and voting preferred stock
outstanding on February 21, 2003, is entitled to one vote per share, voting
together as a single class, at the special meeting. Because the vote on the
merger agreement is based on the number of shares outstanding rather than on the
number of votes cast, failure to vote your shares is effectively a vote
"AGAINST" adoption of the merger agreement (except as described below with
respect to shares of Household common stock held in TRIP accounts). If you are
the record holder of shares of Household common stock or voting preferred stock,
you can vote your shares in any of four ways:

     - Granting Your Proxy by Mail.  If you choose to grant your proxy by mail,
       simply mark your proxy card, date and sign it, and return it in the
       postage-paid envelope provided.

     - Granting Your Proxy by Telephone.  You can grant your proxy by telephone
       by calling the toll-free telephone number on your proxy card. You may
       grant your proxy by telephone 24 hours a day.

     - Granting Your Proxy on the Internet.  You can also grant your proxy on
       the Internet. The web site where you can grant your proxy is on your
       proxy card and is available 24 hours a day.

     - Voting in Person.  You can also vote in person at the special meeting.

     If you grant your proxy by telephone or on the Internet, you should not
return your proxy card. Instructions on how to grant your proxy by telephone or
on the Internet are given on the proxy card included with this document. If you
own shares that are registered in someone else's name, for example, a broker,
you need to direct that person to vote those shares or obtain an authorization
from them and vote those shares yourself at the meeting.

     Your proxy represents any shares of Household common stock and/or voting
preferred stock registered in your name, as well as any full or fractional
shares of Household common stock held in your name under the Household Dividend
Reinvestment and Common Stock Purchase Plan, Household Employee Stock Purchase
Plan, Household International Tax Reduction Investment Plan, which we refer to
as "TRIP," or Household Financial Corporation Limited Match and Save Plan. If
you participate in TRIP, to vote your shares of Household common stock held in
your TRIP account you must return your completed proxy/voting instruction card
to Computershare Investor Services LLC in the envelope provided or grant your
proxy by telephone or on the Internet as outlined on the proxy card by March 25,
2003. Vanguard Fiduciary Trust Company, the TRIP trustee, will act as your proxy
and will vote the shares of Household common stock held in your TRIP account. If
Computershare does not receive your voting instructions for shares held in your
TRIP account by March 25, 2003, your shares will be voted by Vanguard in the
same way as the majority of the TRIP held shares for which voting instructions
are received.

     If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker, trustee or other
holder of record, you must obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from the
holder of record to be able to vote in person at the special meeting.

     If you vote your shares by submitting a proxy, your shares will be voted at
the special meeting as you indicated on your proxy card, telephone proxy or
Internet proxy. If no instructions are indicated on your signed proxy card
(including with respect to proxy cards received for shares held in your TRIP
account), all of your shares will be voted "FOR" the adoption of the merger
agreement.

     As of the record date, the directors and executive officers of Household
owned, in the aggregate, 1,658,303 outstanding shares of Household common stock,
or collectively approximately 0.003% of the outstanding shares of Household
common stock on that date, and no shares of voting preferred stock.

     Household will pay the costs of soliciting proxies for the special meeting.
Officers, directors and employees of Household may solicit proxies by telephone,
mail, the Internet or in person. However, they will not be paid for soliciting
proxies. Household hired Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc. to solicit

                                        34
<PAGE>

proxies, for which they will be paid $20,000 plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket
expenses. Upon request, Household will reimburse brokerage firms and other
custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable expenses in forwarding
solicitation material to beneficial owners of shares of stock entitled to vote
on the merger agreement.

HOW TO REVOKE OR CHANGE YOUR VOTE

     You can revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the special
meeting by:

     - giving written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary of
       Household at Household International, Inc., 2700 Sanders Road, Prospect
       Heights, Illinois, 60070, Attention: Corporate Secretary;

     - submitting another proper proxy by mail, by telephone or on the Internet;
       or

     - attending the special meeting and voting by paper ballot in person.

OTHER BUSINESS

     Household is not currently aware of any business to be acted upon at the
special meeting other than the matters discussed in this document. However, if
other matters do properly come before the Household special meeting it is
intended that shares represented by proxies will be voted, or not voted, by the
individuals named in the proxies at their discretion. No proxy that is voted
against adoption of the merger agreement will be voted in favor of any
adjournment or postponement of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting
additional proxies for such adoption.

        THE EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING OF HSBC ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS

     In connection with the merger, the board of directors of HSBC has convened
an extraordinary general meeting of HSBC ordinary shareholders to be held at
Cabot Hall, Cabot Place West, Canary Wharf, London E14 5AB, United Kingdom, on
March 28, 2003, at 11:00 a.m. local time.

     HSBC ordinary shareholders will not receive this document, but will instead
receive a shareholders' circular prepared in compliance with the laws of the
U.K. and the listing rules of the U.K. Listing Authority, or UKLA, and The Stock
Exchange of Hong Kong Limited, or SEHK.

     At the meeting, a resolution will be proposed:

     - to approve the merger (including the arrangements to be put in place in
       relation to the outstanding options to purchase, and other equity-based
       awards in respect of, shares of Household common stock), and authorize
       the directors of HSBC (or any duly authorized committee thereof) to take
       the necessary steps to implement it, subject to such non-material
       modifications as they think fit; and

     - to authorize the directors of HSBC to allot HSBC ordinary shares in
       satisfaction of HSBC's obligations arising under or as contemplated by
       the merger agreement to issue HSBC ordinary shares to existing holders of
       Household common stock, to holders of options to purchase, and other
       equity-based awards in respect of, Household common stock and to holders
       of other Household securities.

     The authority to be granted by the resolution will expire at the conclusion
of the annual general meeting of HSBC to be held in 2004, except that if the
merger has been completed by that time, HSBC will remain obligated, and continue
to have the authority, to allot the HSBC ordinary shares issuable to holders of
assumed Household options and other equity-based awards and holders of other
Household securities. The authority is in addition to the existing authority to
allot shares granted to the directors at the annual general meeting of HSBC held
on May 31, 2002, which will remain in full force and effect until its expiry.

     The merger is conditioned upon the resolution being passed. The resolution
is being proposed as an ordinary resolution, which requires the approval of a
majority of the votes cast on a show of hands or on a poll at the HSBC
extraordinary general meeting. On a show of hands every HSBC ordinary
shareholder who is present in person, including corporate representatives of
corporate shareholders, shall have one vote. On a poll, every HSBC ordinary
shareholder who is present in person, including corporate representatives of
corporate shareholders, or by proxy shall have one vote for each HSBC ordinary
share he or she holds.

                                   THE MERGER

     This discussion of the merger is qualified by reference to the merger
agreement, which is attached to this document as Annex A. You should read the
entire merger agreement carefully.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     Household's board of directors and executive officers have periodically
reviewed and assessed Household's business strategy, including the markets in
which it operates, consumer lending trends, the economic and regulatory
environment, funding sources and the opportunities and risks of its various
business operations. In the view of Household's management, Household
historically has been able to generate strong cash flows, capital and
consistently profitable results in a variety of economic environments, and it
was therefore anticipated that Household would continue to have reasonable
access to capital markets. However, Household's management also recognized that
Household was the only major U.S. consumer finance company that did not have
significant access to funding sources (such as retail deposits) other than the
global capital markets and that this could, depending upon prevailing economic
and market conditions, affect Household's relative competitive position.
Further, notwithstanding Household's financial track record, capital markets,
including the secondary trading market for debt issued by Household, recently
became more volatile. Household believes that this is the result of numerous
factors, including reports of participants in the consumer lending industry
experiencing regulatory issues and credit quality problems in their portfolios,
uncertainty surrounding a preliminary agreement by Household and state
regulators to settle lending practices issues and related civil litigation and
adverse actions taken by some credit rating agencies with respect to Household's
short-term and long-term debt.

     In 1999 senior management of Household and HSBC first met and developed a
relationship in connection with negotiating a settlement to legal proceedings
involving Household and HSBC brand names in the United Kingdom. Over the
following years, HSBC and Household from time to time informally discussed
potential business relationships, including whether Household could originate
assets for sale to HSBC, whether Household could securitize assets to HSBC's
specification and whether opportunities existed for international joint
ventures.

     In late 2001 and early 2002, Household commenced an evaluation of its
business strategy and the various strategic alternatives available to it in
light of the increasingly challenging capital markets and regulatory
environment, as well as continuing trends towards increasing competition and
consolidation within the financial service industry. Over the next several
months, Household management discussed with its financial advisor, Goldman,
Sachs & Co., and its board of directors these trends and other issues relating
to its operating environment and possible strategic alternatives and directions,
including the possibility of various business combinations that could be
expected to address these issues. These discussions also addressed changing
investor perceptions of the consumer lending industry due to recent
developments, including recent regulatory developments such as the Federal Trade
Commission's suit against Citigroup centered on the alleged practices of its
newly-acquired Associates First Capital subsidiary, actions by regulators
involving some specialized credit card lenders with significant non-prime
portfolios and initiatives in several states and municipalities to increase
regulation of industry practices to address purported predatory lending
concerns. During this period, Household had generalized discussions regarding
potential transactions with potentially interested parties, but no offer to
purchase the company was made. On May 1, 2002, Household formally engaged
Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor in connection with the possible sale of
all or a portion of Household.

     In April 2002, a meeting took place at the initial suggestion of Sir John
Bond, the Group Chairman of HSBC, between William F. Aldinger, the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of Household, and Sir John Bond. At this meeting, Mr.
Aldinger and Sir John had exploratory discussions regarding potential business
opportunities involving Household and HSBC. During the succeeding months and
continuing into the summer, senior executives of Household and HSBC continued
periodically to have informal discussions regarding the environment for
financial services companies and the possible benefits of one or more strategic
transactions between the two companies, including the possibility of joint
ventures in other markets. Capital market conditions became more challenging
during the summer, and it became apparent that Household's

                                        37
<PAGE>

potential cost of funds, as evidenced by secondary market bond trading spreads,
had increased significantly. During this period, Household and Goldman Sachs
continued to analyze Household's strategic alternatives.

     In September 2002, Mr. Aldinger and Sir John met and agreed to expand the
discussions regarding potential business opportunities to include a possible
combination of Household and HSBC. At various times in October and early
November 2002, senior executives of Household and HSBC had further exploratory
discussions regarding a potential business combination between Household and
HSBC. During this period, HSBC and Household also entered into a confidentiality
agreement. In mid-October, representatives of HSBC and Household discussed using
a fixed exchange ratio structure for a potential transaction, but no specific
value for the exchange ratio was discussed.

     In early November 2002, Goldman Sachs and Rohatyn Associates LLC, one of
HSBC's financial advisors, held discussions regarding the potential terms of a
business transaction between Household and HSBC, and HSBC retained Morgan
Stanley & Co. Limited and HSBC Bank plc to act as financial advisors to HSBC.
During the first week of November 2002, Goldman Sachs and Rohaytn Associates
discussed preliminary analyses in support of proposed exchange ratios, and
Household and HSBC commenced preliminary negotiations of the exchange ratio
through their financial advisors. On November 9, 2002, Mr. Aldinger and Sir John
met to discuss the business framework of a potential merger, including financial
and management issues, the possible acquisition consideration and transaction
structure. Mr. Aldinger and Sir John discussed and provisionally agreed (subject
to the approval of their respective boards of directors) on the exchange ratio
for the Household common stock and, over the next several days, Household, HSBC
and their legal advisors engaged in negotiations of the other terms of a
proposed definitive merger agreement, including the consideration to be paid in
the merger to holders of Household's preferred stock, as well as the terms of
retention and employment arrangements that HSBC wished to put in place with key
Household executives in connection with the proposed merger. Household also
retained Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. for the purpose of performing a financial
analysis of Household's preferred stock that was not currently redeemable (7.50%
cumulative preferred stock, 7.60% cumulative preferred stock and 7 5/8%
cumulative preferred stock) and rendering a fairness opinion with respect to the
consideration to be paid to the holders of such preferred stock in the merger.
Household retained two different financial advisors in order for Household's
board of directors to obtain separate, independent opinions regarding the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be received in
the merger by the holders of Household common stock, on the one hand, and by the
holders of such preferred stock, on the other. Shortly after the retention of
Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, senior management of HSBC and Household agreed that the
consideration for the preferred stock would be the stated liquidation preference
of the preferred stock plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the date the merger
was completed.

     At a meeting on November 6, 2002, the Acquisitions and Disposals Committee
of the HSBC board of directors considered a proposal for a potential merger and
authorized Sir John to proceed further with negotiations.

     On November 12, 2002, Household's board of directors met to discuss the
terms of the proposed merger. Members of Household's senior management team
presented an overview of Household's business and operations and also discussed
with the board the strategic rationale of the proposed merger and the operating
fit between Household and HSBC. Management and representatives of Goldman Sachs
also discussed with the board Household's prospects for continuing as an
independent company. The board understood that Household had experienced
continuing and significant funding pressure resulting from wider debt spreads
and negative rating agency actions in late 2002, and that this made Household
vulnerable to decreased capital market access at a time when Household had
substantial levels of debt and asset backed securities, totaling approximately
$31 billion, maturing in 2003. The board noted that the capital markets
environment for Household, combined with the prospect of slower asset growth,
lower commercial paper balances, increased competition and changing investor
perceptions of the consumer lending industry (including regulatory developments
and legislation governing the non-prime credit market) could continue to erode
Household's profitability over time. Management and representatives of Goldman
Sachs continued by reviewing the HSBC business and prospects, noting that HSBC's
more diverse business lines and geography, combined with more stable and better
priced funding sources as a result of bank deposit funding, higher credit
ratings and lower

                                        38
<PAGE>

financial leverage, was likely to present significantly less exposure to many of
the issues confronting Household. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also observed
that many companies with similar business lines to Household were trading at
levels considerably below their 52-week trading highs, with peer credit card,
mortgage finance, auto lending, other consumer finance and commercial finance
companies, trading at median market prices (as of November 11, 2002) as a
percentage of 52-week trading highs of 44.6%, 89.2%, 37.8%, 78.3% and 69.7%,
respectively. The board observed that a positive change of market sentiment
regarding Household was not likely based on current funding and economic
conditions. The Board concluded that combining with HSBC would allow holders of
Household common stock -- as stockholders of the combined entity -- to
participate in improved and more stable growth prospects than Household was
likely to be able to achieve on a stand-alone basis, and determined that the
consideration offered by HSBC in the merger, with an implied value of
approximately $30 per share of Household common stock as of the date of the
Household board meeting, was likely to deliver better value to holders of
Household common stock in the foreseeable future than would be the case if
Household continued as a stand-alone company, notwithstanding Household's recent
historical market prices that included a 2002 high of $63.25 per share.

     Representatives of Goldman Sachs continued by discussing with the board the
consideration to be received by the holders of Household common stock in the
merger and presented to the board the financial analyses described below under
"-- Opinion of Household's Financial Advisor Relating to Common Stock." During
the meeting, the board received the oral opinion of Goldman Sachs, subsequently
confirmed by a written opinion dated November 14, 2002, that as of the date of
the opinion, and subject to the matters and assumptions set forth in its
opinion, the proposed exchange ratio of 2.675 ordinary shares of HSBC for each
share of Household common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to
Household's common stockholders. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods presented to the board
the financial analyses relating to the consideration to be received by the
holders of Household's preferred stock that is not currently redeemable
described under "-- Opinion of Household's Financial Advisor Relating to
Non-Redeemable Preferred Stock." Keefe, Bruyette & Woods delivered its oral
opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by a written opinion, dated November
14, 2002, that as of the date of the opinion, and subject to the matters and
assumptions set forth in its opinion, the proposed consideration to be paid to
the holders of this preferred stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to
these holders. Household's legal advisors, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz,
reviewed with the board the proposed terms of the merger agreement and key
employee retention and employment agreements, discussed the expected timetable
to closing and the various approvals, including stockholder and regulatory
approvals, that would be required to complete the transaction, and reviewed the
legal principles applicable to the Household board's decisions and actions with
respect to the proposed transaction. Household's board of directors discussed
the proposed transaction and asked questions of Household management and the
financial and legal advisors regarding the transaction, after which the board
unanimously approved the merger agreement and proposed merger, and the proposed
retention and employment agreements in connection with the merger.

     At a meeting on November 13, 2002, the HSBC board of directors met to
discuss the terms of the proposed merger and key Household employee retention
and employment agreements. Sir John explained the proposed terms and the
strategic rationale for the merger and presentations were made to the board.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley also participated in the meeting. The members
of the HSBC board of directors present unanimously approved the proposed
transaction and authorized a committee of the board to give the necessary
approval to proceed when all outstanding substantive issues regarding the merger
agreement had been resolved. The committee gave such approval later on November
13, 2002.

     Counsel to Household and HSBC continued to negotiate to finalize legal and
technical points on the merger agreement. Early on November 14, 2002, the
parties executed the merger agreement and issued a joint press release
announcing the execution of the merger agreement.

HOUSEHOLD'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     Household's board of directors consulted with senior management and
Household's financial and legal advisors and considered a number of factors,
including those set forth below, in reaching its decision to

                                        39
<PAGE>

approve the merger and the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement, and to recommend that Household's stockholders vote "FOR"
adoption of the merger agreement.

     Household's board of directors considered the following factors as
generally supporting its decision to enter into the merger agreement:

     - the anticipated strategic fit between HSBC and Household, including

      - that HSBC could elect to use its financial strength and access to
        capital markets on relatively attractive terms to help address current
        Household funding issues,

      - that HSBC could leverage Household's strong asset generation
        capabilities to grow the combined business, particularly in the United
        States,

      - the potential for growth outside of the United States by extending
        Household's business into markets where HSBC has a strong presence,

      - that the limited overlap between the operations of Household and HSBC
        would reduce the risk in integrating the two companies,

      - the potential cost of funding synergies that could result from
        Household's broader range of funding sources within the HSBC group,
        including funding from HSBC's deposits and an increased capacity to
        issue commercial paper, and from tighter interest rate spreads on new
        issues of unsecured term-debt funding and commercial paper, due to
        HSBC's financial strength (as reflected in its higher credit ratings),
        size and diversification, which pre-tax cost of funding synergies were
        estimated by Household to aggregate $115 million, $394 million and $593
        million in 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively,

      - the business opportunities that would result from having an enhanced
        product range and lower funding costs in terms of customer origination
        and migration following the combination of the two companies, and

      - the potential cost savings that could result from reduced operating
        expenses in the combined U.S. credit card business and in Household's
        U.K. businesses and from reductions in Household's systems costs and
        corporate overhead, which pre-tax cost savings were estimated by
        Household to aggregate $91 million, $213 million and $268 million in
        2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively;

     - the presentation made by Goldman Sachs discussed further below under
       "-- Opinion of Household's Financial Advisor Relating to Common Stock,"
       and Goldman Sachs' oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a
       written opinion dated November 14, 2002, to the effect that, as of the
       date of the opinion, and subject to the matters and assumptions stated in
       its opinion, the exchange ratio in the proposed merger was fair, from a
       financial point of view, to the holders of Household common stock. The
       full text of Goldman Sachs' written opinion is attached to this document
       as Annex B;

     - the presentation made by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, described below under
       "-- Opinion of Household's Financial Advisor Relating to Non-Redeemable
       Preferred Stock," and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods' oral opinion, subsequently
       confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated November 14, 2002, to
       the effect that, as of the date of the opinion, and subject to the
       matters and assumptions stated in its opinion, the merger consideration
       to be received by the holders of Household preferred stock that is not
       currently redeemable, was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
       holders of such preferred stock. The full text of Keefe, Bruyette &
       Woods' written opinion is attached to this document as Annex C;

     - the expectation that the merger would be a tax-free transaction for U.S.
       federal income tax purposes and that the conversion of the Household
       common stock into HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs would be tax-free to
       holders of Household common stock;

     - the financial terms of the transaction, including the trading history of
       HSBC ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs, the fixed exchange ratio for holders
       of Household common stock and the cash

                                        40
<PAGE>

       consideration to be received in the merger by holders of Household
       non-voting preferred stock and the anticipated redemption of the
       Household voting preferred stock;

     - the expectation that the merger would be accretive to HSBC's earnings per
       share under U.K. GAAP in 2003 and 2004, as discussed further below under
       "-- Opinion of Household's Financial Advisor Relating to Common
       Stock -- Pro Forma Merger Analysis";

     - the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the nature of
       the parties' representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, which
       Household's board of directors considered would provide a reasonable
       degree of certainty that the merger would be completed;

     - Household's business and operating environment, including competitive,
       economic, regulatory and capital market conditions;

     - Household's financial condition, results of operations, business and
       earnings prospects, as well as Household's operating prospects on a
       stand-alone basis, in the light of relevant factors including the
       changing conditions in the economy and in financial markets, recent
       events involving Household, the evolving regulatory environment faced by
       consumer finance companies and restricted access to and higher costs of
       funding in the capital markets;

     - information available to Household's board of directors concerning other
       strategic alternatives;

     - the belief of Household's board of directors that, in view of the
       foregoing and the matters discussed under "-- Background of the Merger,"
       and notwithstanding Household's recent historical market prices including
       a 2002 high of $63.25 per share, the consideration offered by HSBC in the
       merger, with an implied value of approximately $30 per share of Household
       common stock as of the date of the Household board meeting, was likely to
       deliver better value to holders of Household common stock than would be
       the case in the foreseeable future in the absence of a transaction with
       HSBC;

     - HSBC's business, operations, financial condition and earnings and the
       result of Household's due diligence investigation of HSBC;

     - the required regulatory consents and the likelihood that the merger would
       be approved by the requisite regulatory authorities and otherwise
       completed pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement; and

     - the expectation that the merger could be completed in a reasonable
       timeframe.

     Household's board of directors considered the following factors generally
weighing against a decision to enter into the merger agreement:

     - the difficulties and management distractions inherent in completing a
       merger and an integration of the operations of two companies;

     - the risk that the potential benefits of the merger might not be fully
       achieved;

     - the risk that the merger might not be consummated, and the possible
       adverse implications to customers, investor relations and employee morale
       under such circumstances;

     - the risk that, although Household has the right under limited conditions
       to consider and participate in discussions and negotiations with respect
       to alternative acquisition proposals, the provisions of the merger
       agreement relating to the potential payment of a $550 million termination
       fee may have the effect of discouraging such proposals; and

     - the fact that, although the dollar value implied by the exchange ratio
       (approximately $30 per share based on then-current market prices)
       represented a premium to the then-current market price of Household
       common stock, that value was also below recent historical levels for
       Household common stock, including a 2002 high of $63.25 per share. Please
       refer to "-- Opinion of Household's Financial Advisor Relating to Common
       Stock -- Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis."

     Household's board of directors also considered the retention and employment
arrangements with key Household employees to be entered into in connection with
the merger agreement and the interests that some

                                        41
<PAGE>

Household executive officers and directors have with respect to the merger in
addition to their interests as holders of Household common stock. See
"-- Interests of Household's Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger".

     The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by
Household's board of directors, while not exhaustive, includes the material
factors considered by the board of directors. In view of the variety of factors
considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger, Household's board of
directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise
assign relative or specific weight or values to any of these factors, and
individual directors may have given different weights to different factors.

RECOMMENDATION OF HOUSEHOLD'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     After careful consideration, Household's board of directors has unanimously
determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, including the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of Household and its stockholders, unanimously approved the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and
unanimously recommends that Household stockholders vote "FOR" adoption of the
merger agreement.

OPINION OF HOUSEHOLD'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR RELATING TO COMMON STOCK

     Goldman, Sachs & Co. delivered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in
writing to Household's board of directors that, as of the date of the opinion,
and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the
exchange ratio of 2.675 HSBC ordinary shares or 0.535 HSBC ADSs to be received
for each share of Household common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was
fair from a financial point of view to the holders of Household common stock.

     THE FULL TEXT OF THE WRITTEN OPINION OF GOLDMAN SACHS, DATED NOVEMBER 14,
2002, WHICH SETS FORTH ASSUMPTIONS MADE, PROCEDURES FOLLOWED, MATTERS CONSIDERED
AND LIMITATIONS ON THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE OPINION, IS
ATTACHED AS ANNEX B. HOUSEHOLD'S STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD READ THE OPINION IN ITS
ENTIRETY. GOLDMAN SACHS PROVIDED ITS OPINION FOR THE INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE
OF HOUSEHOLD'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN CONNECTION WITH ITS CONSIDERATION OF THE
MERGER. THE GOLDMAN SACHS OPINION IS NOT A RECOMMENDATION AS TO HOW ANY HOLDER
OF SHARES OF HOUSEHOLD COMMON STOCK OR VOTING PREFERRED STOCK SHOULD VOTE WITH
RESPECT TO THE MERGER.

     In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its
related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:

     - the merger agreement;

     - annual reports to stockholders and annual reports on Forms 10-K and
       10-K/A of Household (including its predecessor companies) for the five
       years ended December 31, 2001;

     - annual reviews to shareholders of HSBC for the five years ended December
       31, 2001 and annual reports on Forms 20-F and 20-F/A of HSBC for the
       three years ended December 31, 2001;

     - certain interim reports to stockholders and quarterly reports on Forms
       10-Q and 10-Q/A of Household;

     - certain interim reports to shareholders and reports of foreign private
       issuers on Form 6-K of HSBC;

     - certain other communications from Household and HSBC to their respective
       stockholders and shareholders;

     - internal financial analyses and forecasts for Household prepared by its
       management; and

     - certain cost savings and operating synergies projected by the management
       of Household to result from the merger.

     Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior managements
of Household and HSBC regarding their assessment of the strategic rationale for,
and the potential benefits of, the transaction

                                        42
<PAGE>

contemplated by the merger agreement and the past and current business
operations, financial condition and future prospects of their respective
companies, including discussions with Household with respect to the importance
of the funding environment to the financial performance of consumer finance
companies. In addition, Goldman Sachs reviewed the reported price and trading
activity for the Household common stock and the HSBC ordinary shares (including
price and trading activity for HSBC ADSs, each of which represents an ownership
interest in five HSBC ordinary shares), compared certain financial and stock
market information for Household and HSBC with similar information for certain
other companies, the securities of which are publicly traded, reviewed the
financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the finance industry
specifically and in other industries generally and performed such other studies
and analyses as it considered appropriate.

     Goldman Sachs relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial, accounting and other information discussed with or reviewed by it and
assumed such accuracy and completeness for the purpose of rendering the opinion
described above. HSBC did not make available to Goldman Sachs any projections of
expected future performance. Accordingly, Goldman Sachs' review of HSBC's
expected future performance was limited to discussions with the management of
HSBC of certain research analysts' estimates. Goldman Sachs assumed with the
consent of Household's board of directors that HSBC's allowances for loan and
lease portfolio losses are in the aggregate adequate to cover all loan and lease
portfolio losses. In addition, Goldman Sachs did not review individual credit
files or make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and
liabilities (including any derivative or off-balance sheet assets and
liabilities) of Household or HSBC or any of their respective subsidiaries, nor
was Goldman Sachs furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs
assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and
approvals necessary for the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the
merger agreement will be obtained without any adverse effect on Household or
HSBC or their respective subsidiaries or on the expected benefits of the merger.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by
Goldman Sachs in connection with rendering the opinion described above. The
following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the
financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs. The order of analyses described
does not represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by
Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include
information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with
the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of
Goldman Sachs' financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following
quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is
based on market data as it existed on or before November 14, 2002 and is not
necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

     Historical Stock Trading Analysis.  Goldman Sachs reviewed the historical
trading prices for the Household common stock for the twelve-month period ended
November 11, 2002. In addition, Goldman Sachs analyzed the consideration to be
received by holders of Household common stock pursuant to the merger agreement
in relation to the closing market prices of the Household common stock on
November 11, 2002 and November 8, 2002, based on the closing price of HSBC
ordinary shares on such dates.

     This analysis indicated that the price per share to be received by holders
of Household common stock based on the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger
agreement represented:

     - a premium of 29.0% based on the November 11, 2002 (the last full trading
       day prior to the Household board of directors meeting to discuss the
       proposed merger) closing price of $23.07 per share; and

     - a premium of 31.3% based on the November 8, 2002 (the last full trading
       day prior to the meeting at which Mr. Aldinger and Sir John discussed an
       exchange ratio for the Household common stock) closing price of $23.05
       per share.

     Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis.  Goldman Sachs reviewed the closing
prices of Household common stock divided by the corresponding closing prices of
HSBC ADSs over the three-year period ended November 11, 2002. In addition,
Goldman Sachs calculated the average of these historical daily exchange

                                        43
<PAGE>

ratios for the one-month, two-month, three-month, one-year and three-year
periods ended November 11, 2002. The following table presents the results of
these calculations:

<Table>

<S>                                                           <C>

1-Year Average..............................................      0.813
3-Year Average..............................................      0.807
</Table>

     Comparison of the transaction exchange ratio to historical exchange ratios
is a measure used to analyze the per share consideration to be received by the
holders of Household common stock in relation to the equity capital market's
historical relative valuations of Household common stock and HSBC ADSs. The
analysis indicated that the 0.535 HSBC ADSs to be received in exchange for each
share of Household common stock in the merger represented (1) a premium to the
ratio of the market price of Household common stock to the market price of HSBC
ADSs on November 11, 2002, (2) a premium to the average ratio of such prices for
the one-month and two-month periods ended November 11, 2002 and (3) a discount
to the average ratio of such prices for the three-month, one-year and three-year
periods ended November 11, 2002.

     The transaction exchange ratio of 0.535x would result in the holders of
Household common stock owning approximately 12% of the outstanding ordinary
shares of the pro forma combined company following the merger.

  SELECTED COMPANIES ANALYSIS

     Household Peers.  Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared certain financial
information for Household to corresponding financial information, ratios and
public market multiples for the following publicly traded corporations in the
finance industry:

     Credit Card Companies

      - MBNA Corporation

      - Capital One Financial Corporation

      - Providian Financial Corporation

      - CompuCredit Corporation

      - Metris Companies Inc.

     Mortgage Finance Companies

      - Countrywide Financial Corporation

      - Doral Financial Corporation

      - IndyMac Bancorp, Inc.

     Auto Lenders

      - AmeriCredit Corp.

      - WFS Financial Inc.

     Other Consumer Finance Companies

      - American Express Company

                                        44
<PAGE>

     Commercial Finance Companies

      - CIT Group Inc.

      - GATX Corporation

      - Financial Federal Corporation

      - DVI, Inc.

     Although none of the selected companies is directly comparable to
Household, the companies included were chosen because they are publicly traded
companies with operations that, for purposes of analysis, may be considered
similar to certain operations of Household.

     Goldman Sachs calculated and compared various financial multiples and
ratios based on publicly available financial data as of June 30, 2002,
information it obtained from SEC filings and Institutional Brokers Estimate
System, or IBES, estimates. The multiples and ratios for Household were
calculated using the closing price of Household common stock on November 11,
2002, with Household's equity adjusted to reflect its October 2002 common stock
and convertible securities offering and October 11, 2002 proposed settlement
with state attorneys general. The multiples and ratios for each of the selected
companies were based on the most recent publicly available information. With
respect to the selected companies, Goldman Sachs calculated:

      - net income for the twelve months ended June 30, 2002, as a percentage of
        the average common equity for that period; and

      - net income for the twelve months ended June 30, 2002, as a percentage of
        the average managed assets for that period.

     Net income to average common equity and net income to average managed
assets are measures used to analyze a company's profitability and operating
performance over a stated period. The analysis indicated that Household's ratios
of net income to average common equity and net income to average managed assets
for the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2002 were higher than the medians of
these ratios for Household's selected peers. Goldman Sachs then compared these
measures to the corresponding values for Household. The results of these
analyses are summarized as follows:

     Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the selected companies' ratios of
November 11, 2002 stock price to calendar year 2002 and 2003 IBES earnings
estimates and June 30, 2002 book value with the corresponding ratios for
Household. Stock price to IBES estimated earnings and stock price to book value
(equity) per share are measures used to analyze the equity capital market's
valuation of a company. The analysis indicated that Household's ratios of
November 11, 2002 stock price to IBES estimated 2002 and 2003 earnings were
lower than the medians of these ratios for Household's selected peers and that
its ratio of

     HSBC Peers.  Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared certain financial
information for HSBC to corresponding financial information, ratios and public
market multiples for the following publicly traded corporations in the banking
industry:

     Asia Banks

      - Hang Seng Bank Limited (which is a subsidiary of HSBC)

      - DBS Group Holdings Ltd

     United Kingdom Banks

      - Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc

      - U.S. Bancorp

     Although none of the selected companies is directly comparable to HSBC, the
companies included were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with
operations that, for purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain
operations of HSBC.

     Goldman Sachs calculated and compared various financial multiples and
ratios based on publicly available financial data as of June 30, 2002,
information it obtained from SEC filings and IBES estimates. The multiples and
ratios of HSBC were calculated using the closing price of HSBC ordinary shares
on November 11, 2002. The multiples and ratios for each of the selected
companies were based on the most recent publicly available information. With
respect to the selected companies, Goldman Sachs calculated:

      - the ratio of price to 2003 IBES estimated earnings, as a multiple of
        IBES estimated earnings growth; and

      - dividend yield.

                                        46
<PAGE>

     Stock price to IBES estimated earnings divided by the median IBES estimated
five-year growth rate is a measure used to analyze the equity capital market's
valuation of a company in relation to its estimated growth prospects. Dividend
yield represents a company's annual dividend paid to shareholders in relation to
its current stock price. The analysis indicated that HSBC's ratio of November
11, 2002 stock price to IBES estimated 2003 earnings per share divided by its
IBES five-year median growth estimate, as well as HSBC's dividend yield, were
higher than the medians of these ratios for HSBC's selected peers. The results
of these analyses are summarized as follows:

     Goldman Sachs also calculated and compared the selected companies'
estimated calendar year 2002 and 2003 price/IBES estimated earnings ratios and
price to book value ratios to the results for HSBC. Stock price to IBES
estimated earnings and stock price to book value (equity) per share multiples
are measures used to analyze the equity capital market's valuation of a company.
The analysis indicated that HSBC's ratios of November 11, 2002 stock price to:
IBES estimated 2002 earnings per share, IBES estimated 2003 earnings per share,
June 30, 2002 stated book value and June 30, 2002 tangible common equity were in
line with the medians of these ratios for HSBC's selected peers. The following

     In addition, Goldman Sachs compared, for the five-year period ended
November 11, 2002, the average ratio of trading price to next twelve months IBES
earnings estimates for the HSBC ordinary shares and the selected companies.
Stock price to IBES estimated earnings is a measure used to analyze the equity
capital market's valuation of a company. The analysis indicated that HSBC's
average ratio of stock price to IBES estimated earnings over the stated period
was higher than the selected U.K. banks' averages and U.S. banks' averages and
in line with the Asia banks' averages. The following table presents the results

     Analysis of Exchange Ratio.  Goldman Sachs performed certain analyses,
based on historical information and earnings estimates for Household of $4.24
per share in 2003 and $4.66 in 2004 (including estimated adjustments of $0.16
and $0.18 for 2003 and 2004, respectively, as a result of the transition to U.K.
GAAP)

provided by management of Household and earnings estimates for Household
provided by IBES at an exchange ratio of 0.535x (which represents the number of
HSBC ADSs that holders of Household common stock may elect to receive for each
share of Household common stock in the merger).

     The earnings estimates provided to Goldman Sachs by management were not
prepared with a view to public disclosure. The earnings estimates are
forward-looking statements, made only as of the date of Goldman Sachs' opinion,
and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results
to differ materially from those estimates; accordingly, such estimates should
not be relied upon by investors as an accurate prediction of future events.
Please refer to "Forward-Looking Statements." Based on the November 11, 2002
closing price of $23.07 for shares of Household common stock (except where
noted) and $55.61 for HSBC ADSs, Goldman Sachs calculated for Household the
implied aggregate consideration (on a diluted basis), the ratio of aggregate
consideration to IBES estimated U.S. GAAP earnings for the calendar years 2003
and 2004 and the ratio of aggregate consideration to U.S. GAAP book value as of
September 30, 2002 (pro forma for Household's recent common stock and

     Dividend Discount Analysis.  Goldman Sachs performed a dividend discount
analysis on Household and on the combined company following the merger (a) using
earnings estimates for Household provided by Household of $4.40 per share in
2003 and $4.84 per share in 2004, which assume a decrease in Household's cost of
funds from 400-600 basis points over three-year U.S. Treasuries (Household's
spreads for a three-year average maturity prior to the merger announcement) in
the unsecured debt markets to 250 basis points over three-year U.S. Treasuries
by 2005, and (b) using earnings estimates for Household provided by Household of
$4.40 per share in 2003 and $4.84 per share in 2004, with adjustments for the
assumption of a continuation of the current funding environment for Household.
The analysis with respect to the combined company utilized IBES estimated
earnings for HSBC of $3.82 per HSBC ADS in 2003 and $4.24 per HSBC ADS in 2004
and earnings estimates for Household provided by Household of $4.24 per share in
2003 and $4.66 per share in 2004 (including estimated adjustments of $0.16 per
share and $0.18 per share in 2003 and 2004, respectively, as a result of the
transition to U.K. GAAP), and synergies for Household within the combined
company projected by Household management, including reduced funding costs
resulting from Household's broader range of funding sources and tighter new
issue spreads (i.e., the difference between the offered yield on Household
securities and a benchmark such as U.S. Treasuries or the London Interbank
Offered Rate, or LIBOR) on unsecured term debt and commercial paper, increased
capacity for commercial paper and reduced expenses resulting from increased
operational efficiencies for Household within the combined company. Goldman
Sachs estimated the implied present values of a share of Household common stock
both on a stand-alone basis and for the combined company by calculating an
implied net present value of dividends for Household and the combined company
based on historical dividend levels for Household and HSBC for the years 2003
through 2007 and a terminal value at year-end 2007. Goldman Sachs calculated
implied per share ranges of the Household common stock and the HSBC ordinary
shares using implied terminal values at

                                        48
<PAGE>

year-end 2007 based on multiples of 2008 estimated earnings ranging from 4.8x to
8.8x, with respect to Household, and 11.7x to 15.7x, with respect to the
combined company. The Household terminal multiples were derived from its
six-month average price to IBES estimated next twelve-months earnings ratio. The
terminal multiples for the combined company were derived from a weighted average
of HSBC and Household price to earnings ratios (based on Household management
projected 2003 earnings for Household and IBES estimated 2003 earnings for
HSBC). These implied terminal value indications were then discounted to an
implied present value using discount rates ranging from 11.9% to 15.9%, with
respect to Household, and 9.3% to 13.3%, with respect to the combined company.
The discount rates with respect to Household were derived from the estimated
cost of Household's equity and a blended cost of equity for the combined
company, calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model and certain
assumptions, including a market premium, predicted betas (as calculated by
Barra, an analytical service) for Household and HSBC, respectively, and a
risk-free rate derived from the yield on ten-year U.S. Treasuries. A stock's
beta is a measure of the volatility of its price relative to the overall stock
market. The blended cost of equity for the combined company was calculated using
the Capital Asset Pricing Model and a blended beta (based on Household
management projected 2003 earnings for Household and IBES estimated 2003
earnings for HSBC). The ranges of terminal value multiples were chosen to
reflect sensitivities to the market valuation as of November 11, 2002 for
Household and the weighted average market valuation as of November 11, 2002 for
the combined company based upon 2004 IBES estimated earnings contributions. The
range of discount rates was chosen to reflect sensitivities to the estimated
cost of equity for Household and HSBC as of November 11, 2002. The following
table presents the results of this analysis:

     Pro Forma Merger Analysis.  Goldman Sachs prepared pro forma analyses of
the financial impact of the merger using earnings estimates and projected
synergies for Household prepared by Household's management and earnings
estimates from IBES for HSBC. The analyses indicated pro forma earnings
accretion, primarily derived from the premium multiple of stock price to IBES
estimated 2003 and 2004 earnings at which HSBC trades (and has historically
traded) in relation to Household. The analyses with respect to the combined
company also assumed synergies for Household projected by Household's
management. For each of the years 2003 and 2004, Goldman Sachs compared the
earnings per share, or EPS, of HSBC ordinary shares, on a stand-alone basis, to
the EPS of the common stock of the combined company, both including and
excluding synergies. Goldman Sachs performed this analysis based on the closing
prices of Household common stock and HSBC ADSs on November 11, 2002. Based on
such analyses, the proposed transaction would be accretive to HSBC's IBES
estimated 2003 earnings by 9.9% with synergies and 8.2% without synergies, and
IBES estimated 2004 earnings by 12.8% with synergies and 8.4% without synergies.

     In addition, based on the current quarterly dividend of $0.25 paid on the
Household common stock, or $1.00 per share annualized, and the HSBC dividend
paid in 2002 of $2.47 per HSBC ADS, holders of Household common stock would
receive an additional $0.32 in dividends on a pro forma per share of Household
common stock basis, representing an implied dividend accretion to Household
stockholders of approximately 32%.

     Goldman Sachs analyzed the potential impact of the proposed merger on
HSBC's market valuation and, thereby, the consideration to be received by
Household stockholders. Using the assumed accretion to HSBC IBES estimated 2004
EPS of 12.8% with synergies and 8.4% without synergies, Goldman Sachs calculated
the stock price of the combined company at various ratios of price to estimated
2004 pro forma earnings. After accounting for the assumed EPS accretion from the
proposed merger with synergies, Goldman Sachs estimated that HSBC's ratio of
price to estimated 2004 earnings could decline from 13.1x to 11.6x before having
a negative impact on HSBC's share price. Excluding synergies, HSBC's ratio of
price to estimated 2004 earnings could decline from 13.1x to 12.1x before having
a negative impact on HSBC's stock price. The following table presents the
results of this analysis:

  ** Breakeven P/E is the estimated price to earnings ratio at which the
     combined company must trade in order to maintain HSBC's November 11, 2002
     ADS price of $55.61. Assuming accretion to HSBC IBES estimated 2004
     earnings of 8.4% (without synergies) or 12.8% (with synergies), a P/E ratio
     higher than the breakeven P/E would result in an increase in the trading
     price for the HSBC ordinary shares, and a P/E ratio lower than the
     breakeven P/E would result in a decreased trading price for the HSBC
     ordinary shares.

 *** Assumes 8.4% 2004E U.K. GAAP EPS accretion to HSBC.

**** Assumes 12.8% 2004E U.K. GAAP EPS accretion to HSBC.

     Flowback Analysis.  Goldman Sachs performed an analysis of the possible
effect of flowback, and compared estimated flowback to the average daily trading
volume of HSBC ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs across all exchanges, using
institutional shareholdings as of June 30, 2002. Assuming sales of HSBC ordinary
shares and HSBC ADSs received in the merger by 70% of retail and active
institutional holders of Household common stock, sales of HSBC ordinary shares
and HSBC ADSs received in the merger by all passive institutional holders of
Household common stock upon removal of Household from the S&P 500 Index, and
purchases of combined company stock upon re-weighting of HSBC in U.K. indices,
this illustrative analysis indicated that an estimated 61.3% of HSBC ordinary
shares and HSBC ADSs received by holders of Household common stock in the merger
would be sold as a result of the transaction. The market value of these HSBC
ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs, based on the exchange ratio and the $55.61
closing price of HSBC ADSs on November 11, 2002 would represent approximately 17
times the average daily trading volume of HSBC ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs,
based on the average daily trading volume for HSBC ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs
across all exchanges for the three-month period ended November 11, 2002. The
number of days of trading volume represented by various levels of sales of
acquiror stock to be received by holders of acquired company stock in a merger
is a measure used to analyze the ability of the market to absorb

 * Goldman Sachs' estimate of the percentage of HSBC ordinary shares and HSBC
   ADSs received by holders of Household common stock in the merger to be sold
   as a result of the transaction.

** Equals market value of sales divided by $516 million average daily worldwide
   trading volume of HSBC ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs for the three months
   prior to November 11, 2002.

     Goldman Sachs calculated the ratios of the equity value of the merger to
the market capitalization of HSBC and to the three-month average daily trading
volume of HSBC as of November 11, 2002. The ratios of merger equity value to
market capitalization and trading volume of the acquiror are measures used to
analyze the ability of the market to absorb potential sales of acquiror stock as
a result of a merger transaction. Goldman Sachs compared these ratios to the
equity values of each of the ten largest foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies
as percentages of acquiror market capitalization on the date of announcement and
as ratios to acquiror average daily trading volume for the three months prior to
the announcement.

 * Trading volume based on the three-month average for acquirers' daily trading

** Based on November 11, 2002 closing prices.

     This analysis indicated that, assuming, for illustrative purposes, sales of
100% of HSBC ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs received by holders of Household
stock in the merger, the equity value of the merger equals 14% of the acquiror's
pre-announcement market capitalization, and a multiple of 27.7x the three-month
average daily trading volume of HSBC stock.

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without

                                        51
<PAGE>

considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the
processes underlying Goldman Sachs' opinion. In arriving at its fairness
determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and
did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by
it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of
its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of
its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a
comparison is directly comparable to Household or HSBC or the contemplated
transaction.

     Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses solely for the purpose of Goldman
Sachs' providing its opinion to Household's board of directors as to the
fairness from a financial point of view of the merger. These analyses do not
purport to be appraisals or necessarily to reflect the prices at which
businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of
future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which
may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses.
Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon
numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective
advisors, none of Household, HSBC, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes
responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasted.

     As described above in "-- Household's Reasons for the Merger," Goldman
Sachs' opinion to Household's board of directors was one of many factors taken
into consideration by Household's board of directors in making its determination
to approve the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a
complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection
with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex B.

     Goldman Sachs, as part of its investment banking business, is continually
engaged in performing financial analyses with respect to businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated
underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities and private placements as well as for financial analyses for
estate, corporate and other purposes. Goldman Sachs is familiar with Household
having provided certain investment banking services to Household from time to
time, including having acted as joint lead manager for a public offering of $300
million of preferred stock of Household in September 2001; having acted as sole
bookrunner for a public offering of 18.7 million shares of common stock of
Household and $542 million of Adjustable Conversion-Rate Equity Security Units
of Household in October 2002; having acted as commercial paper dealer for
Household, commencing in October 2002; and having acted as its financial advisor
in connection with, and having participated in certain of the negotiations
leading to, the merger agreement. Household paid total fees and commissions to
Goldman Sachs of $1.2 million and $17.2 million in 2001 and 2002, respectively.

     Goldman Sachs also has provided investment banking services to HSBC from
time to time, including having acted as lead manager for a public offering of $4
billion aggregate principal amount of Non-cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock
of HSBC in May 2000; and having acted as HSBC's financial advisor in connection
with its acquisition of CCF S.A., formerly known as Credit Commercial de France
S.A., in July 2000.

     Household's board of directors selected Goldman Sachs as its financial
advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that
has substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger.

     Goldman Sachs provides a full range of financial advisory and securities
services and, in the course of its normal trading activities, may from time to
time effect transactions and hold securities, including derivative instruments,
of Household or HSBC for its own account and for the accounts of customers.

     Goldman Sachs may provide investment banking services to Household, HSBC
and their respective subsidiaries in the future.

     Pursuant to the terms of an engagement letter between Household and Goldman
Sachs, Household has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a transaction fee of
$27,000,000, $5,000,000 of which will be paid upon the mailing of this document
to Household's stockholders and $22,000,000 of which will be paid upon
completion of the merger. In addition, Household has agreed to reimburse Goldman
Sachs for its reasonable expenses,

                                        52
<PAGE>

including attorneys' fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and
related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under
the federal securities laws.

OPINION OF HOUSEHOLD'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR RELATING TO NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED
STOCK

     Household engaged Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., or KBW, to render an
opinion regarding the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the cash
consideration to be paid under the merger agreement to the holders of each
depositary share representing one-fortieth of a share of Household 7 5/8%
cumulative preferred stock, 7.50% cumulative preferred stock or 7.60% cumulative
preferred stock, which collectively constitute the outstanding currently
non-redeemable preferred stock of Household. Household selected KBW because KBW
is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with substantial experience
in transactions similar to the merger. As part of its investment banking
business, KBW is continually engaged in the valuation of banking and financial
service company securities in connection with acquisitions. Household did not
provide specific instructions to, or place any limitation on, KBW with respect
to the procedures to be followed or factors to be considered by KBW in
performing its analyses or providing its opinion.

     KBW attended and made a presentation to the meeting of Household's board of
directors on November 12, 2002. During this meeting, KBW rendered an oral
opinion (subsequently confirmed in a written opinion dated November 14, 2002)
that, as of the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to the factors
and assumptions set forth in KBW's written opinion, the cash consideration to be
received in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders
of the currently non-redeemable preferred stock.

     The full text of KBW's written opinion is attached as Annex C to this
document and is incorporated herein by reference. Holders of the currently
non-redeemable preferred stock are urged to read that opinion in its entirety
for a description of the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters
considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW.

     KBW's opinion is directed to Household's board of directors and addresses
only the cash consideration to be received under the merger agreement by holders
of the currently non-redeemable preferred stock. KBW's opinion does not address
the consideration to be received under the merger agreement by the holders of
Household common stock or the underlying business decision to engage in the
merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of Household
entitled to vote at the special meeting as to how that stockholder should vote
or act on any matter related to the proposed merger.

     In arriving at its opinion, KBW:

     - reviewed the merger agreement;

     - reviewed Household's Certificate of Incorporation and the certificates of
       designations of the currently non-redeemable preferred stock;

     - reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information
       relating to Household and HSBC;

     - reviewed other information, including the terms, call provisions, and
       conditions of the currently non-redeemable preferred stock of Household;

     - reviewed the credit ratings and certain financial and market data of the
       currently non-redeemable preferred stock of Household;

     - compared certain financial and credit rating information, and information
       for selected other issues of preferred securities, trust preferred
       securities and debt securities that KBW deemed similar to the currently
       non-redeemable preferred stock of Household; and

     - considered such other information, financial studies, analyses and
       investigations and financial, economic and market criteria that KBW
       deemed relevant.

     In connection with its review, KBW did not assume any responsibility for
independent verification of any of the foregoing information and KBW relied on
this information being complete and accurate in all material

                                        53
<PAGE>

respects. In addition, KBW was not requested to make, and did not make, an
independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) of Household or of HSBC, nor did KBW review any loan or credit files
of Household and KBW was not furnished with any such evaluations, appraisals or
reviews. KBW also assumed that Household has adequately reserved against losses
that may be incurred as a result of non-performing or defaulting loans. KBW did
not express any opinion as to the prices at which the currently non-redeemable
preferred stock of Household would trade at any time, and KBW assumed that the
merger will be completed in accordance with the terms and conditions outlined in
the merger agreement. KBW's opinion was necessarily based upon available
information and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they existed
and could be evaluated on the date it was rendered.

     The KBW opinion was among several factors taken into consideration by
Household's board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger
agreement and the merger. Consequently, the analyses described below should not
be viewed as determinative of the decision of the board of directors or
management of Household with respect to the fairness of the cash consideration
to be received under the merger agreement by holders of the currently
non-redeemable preferred stock.

     The following is a summary of the material analyses presented by KBW to
Household's board of directors on November 12, 2002, in connection with its
opinion. The summary is not a complete description of the analyses underlying
the KBW opinion or the presentation made by KBW to Household's board of
directors, but summarizes the material analyses performed and presented in
connection with such opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex
analytic process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and
relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to
the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its
opinion, KBW did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor
that it considered, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance
and relevance of each analysis and factor. The financial analyses summarized
below include information presented in tabular format. Accordingly, KBW believes
that its analyses and the summary of its analyses must be considered as a whole
and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on the
information presented below in tabular format, without considering all analyses
and factors or the full narrative description of the financial analyses,
including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses
and opinion. The tables alone are not a complete description of the financial
analyses.

  PREMIUM TO CURRENT MARKET PRICE.  KBW compared the cash consideration of $25
per depositary share to be paid under the merger agreement to the holders of
depositary shares representing fractional shares of the currently non-redeemable
preferred stock to the current market price of each depositary share of
currently non-redeemable preferred stock. Based on the market price as of the
close of business on November 11, 2002, the cash consideration of $25
represented the following premiums to the market price:

     The analysis indicated that the cash consideration to be paid to the
holders of depositary shares under the merger agreement offered them a premium
of at least 21.6% to the then current market price of their shares.

  SUMMARY OF CURRENTLY NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK.  KBW analyzed the key
terms and characteristics of each series of currently non-redeemable preferred
stock, including the dates at which each series would become mandatorily
redeemable by Household pursuant to its terms. Those terms and characteristics
are summarized in the following tables:

     In addition, KBW reviewed the voting rights and ranking of each series of
currently non-redeemable preferred stock. KBW noted that the redemption
provisions of the currently non-redeemable preferred stock would limit potential
upside in their market prices even with favorable credit trends.

  TRADING HISTORY OF AFFECTED PREFERRED STOCK.  KBW analyzed the current, high,
low and average yield spread of the currently non-redeemable preferred stock
measured relative to U.S. 30-year treasuries. The results of that analysis are
summarized in the following table:

(2) Yield spread measures since issue date; spread measured relative to 30-year
    treasury (5 3/8, maturing February 15, 2031).

     The analysis indicated that the yield-spread of the currently
non-redeemable preferred stock relative to U.S. 30-year treasuries was at or
near its highest level since its issue date.

     KBW also reviewed with Household's board of directors the trading price
history of each series of currently non-redeemable preferred stock since its
date of issuance.

  COMPARABLE ANALYSIS.  KBW analyzed a group of comparably-rated preferred,
trust preferred and debt securities issued by banking companies and the
securities of selected financial services companies in order to assess the
current trading market for similar securities issued by a peer group. The
results of the comparison are set out in the following table:

(1) Based on 30-year treasury yield of 4.74%.

     KBW noted that the comparable issues had bid side yield spreads in the
range of 2.70% to 3.64%, implying yields in the range of 7.44% to 8.38%,
compared with the currently non-redeemable preferred stock which, as of November
11, 2002, had spreads in the range 4.74% to 4.79%, implying yields in the range
of 9.25% to 9.34%. KBW noted that the current trading market and bid side
spreads for Household's currently non-redeemable preferred stock were more
characteristic of the market for sub-investment grade securities.

     Household's board of directors engaged KBW as an independent contractor to
act as financial advisor to Household regarding the consideration to be paid to
holders of the currently non-redeemable preferred stock in the merger. As part
of its investment banking business, KBW is continually engaged in the valuation
of banking and financial services company securities in connection with
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for various other
purposes. As specialists in the securities of banking and financial services
companies, KBW has experience in, and knowledge of, the valuation of banking and
financial services enterprises. In the ordinary course of its business as a
broker-dealer, KBW may, from time to time, purchase securities from, and sell
securities to, Household and HSBC and as a market-maker in securities, KBW may
from time to time have a long or short position in, and buy or sell, debt or
equity securities of Household and HSBC for KBW's own account and for the
accounts of its customers.

     Household and KBW have entered into an agreement relating to the services
to be provided by KBW in connection with the rendering of its fairness opinion.
Household agreed to pay KBW a cash fee of $333,000 promptly after entering into
the agreement. In addition, Household has agreed to pay KBW a cash fee of
$333,000 promptly after the mailing of this document and to pay KBW a cash fee
of $334,000 at the time of consummation of the merger. Pursuant to the KBW
engagement agreement, Household has also agreed to reimburse KBW for reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses and disbursements incurred in connection with KBW's
engagement and to indemnify KBW against various liabilities, including
liabilities under the federal securities laws. Other than as set forth in this
paragraph, Household has not paid any fees or commissions to KBW during the last
two years.

HSBC'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     The merger brings together one of the world's most successful deposit
gatherers with one of the world's largest generators of assets, and creates
significant opportunities to strengthen HSBC's business in a way that benefits
its shareholders and is consistent with its strategic objectives.

     The merger improves the geographic balance of HSBC's earnings,
significantly increasing the contribution from the North American business and
creating a more well balanced worldwide portfolio. The following table sets
forth information regarding the contributions by geographic region to the
profits and assets of HSBC and of HSBC and Household on an aggregated basis at
and for the six months ended June 30, 2002.

Household offers HSBC national coverage in the United States for consumer
lending, credit cards and credit insurance through varied distribution channels
including approximately 1,400 offices in 46 states, over 10,500 franchised auto
dealerships, 140 retail merchant relationships, over 250 correspondent mortgage
broker relationships and multiple web sites. Nevertheless, this improved
geographic balance might not prove beneficial to HSBC if the U.S. economy is
weaker than generally anticipated over the medium and long term.

     At June 30, 2002, HSBC had approximately $101 billion of loans and advances
to banks and approximately $173 billion of debt securities. As a result of
diminished corporate credit demand, HSBC faces potential challenges in deploying
other capital without increasing concentration risk. By expanding its U.S.
consumer finance operations through the merger, HSBC seeks to add an asset class
that further diversifies its portfolio to offset its potential exposure to
increased concentration risk. HSBC is aware, however, that some customers and
investors could react negatively to HSBC being associated with sub-prime lending
and that pending litigation and negative publicity associated with allegations
of improper lending practices by companies in this sector, including Household,
could reduce the benefits of the merger to HSBC. Please refer to "Risk Factors
Relating to the Merger."

     In terms of customer focus, the merger meets HSBC's stated objective of
growing consumer assets, adding over 50 million consumer accounts worldwide and
total assets of $122 billion on a U.K. GAAP basis as of June 30, 2002. The
current subdued outlook for world economies, interest rates, inflation and
corporate profitability increases the attractiveness of being able to access
directly consumers at the point in time when they are contemplating entering
into a financial transaction or reviewing their financial affairs. In this
regard HSBC believes that Household's technology platforms and practices, in
particular, in the areas of marketing, database management and credit scoring
capability, are at the forefront of global practice, and that the merger will
allow for the leveraging of these practices throughout the enlarged group.

     The combination of HSBC with Household creates a top 10 credit card issuer
globally, and presents a significant opportunity to achieve cost benefits for
the enlarged group by consolidating HSBC's North American card processing
business, presently outsourced, with that of Household's. HSBC expects the
significant scalability in volume of Household's credit card platforms to allow
for low cost expansion across wider geographic markets.

     HSBC believes that the merger offers the opportunity to significantly
expand its consumer franchise. The following table sets forth information
regarding the contribution by business line to the profits and loans/
receivables of HSBC and of HSBC and Household on an aggregated basis at and for
the six months ended June 30, 2002.

     The merger offers significant opportunities to extend Household's business
model into countries and territories currently served by HSBC and broadens the
product range available to the enlarged customer base. HSBC believes that the
merger will allow the enlarged group to capture valuable customer business that
currently falls outside either company's franchise. HSBC expects that the merger
will permit the enlarged group to market "prime" products through Household's
origination channels in the United States and "non-prime" products to HSBC's
deposit customers who are not eligible for HSBC's traditional loan products. It
also expects that the merger will allow customers, who might otherwise have
ceased to be Household customers as their financial circumstances improve, to
migrate from Household to HSBC, thereby remaining customers of the enlarged
group. HSBC also intends to link Household's Hispanic customer base with its
Mexican banking network for remittance services and to link HSBC's Mexican
banking network, including the recently acquired Grupo Financiero Bital S.A. de
C.V., with Household's consumer finance capabilities to serve qualifying
emigrants.

     HSBC and Household currently utilize compatible systems architectures,
which is expected to allow for cost savings through consolidation and common
purchasing. The combination of businesses is also expected to produce cost
savings in the areas of administrative support and through consolidating card
processing. HSBC also expects that funding costs for the Household business will
be lower in the future as a result of the financial strength and funding
diversity of HSBC.

     HSBC has not attempted to quantify the cost savings and opportunities for
revenue enhancements discussed above. HSBC's expectation that it may realize
these synergies is based upon its expertise in, and knowledge of, the global
financial services industry and its prior experience in making other substantial
acquisitions. For example, HSBC's belief that the merger presents a significant
opportunity to achieve cost benefits by consolidating North American card
processing is based upon its assumption that internalizing this business, which
is presently outsourced, would be less expensive for the combined company. HSBC
believes that cost savings as a result of compatible systems architecture can be
anticipated on the basis of consolidation and the benefits to be gained through
common purchasing. HSBC expects to achieve revenue enhancements based on its
belief that HSBC and Household are currently unable to capture valuable customer
business that falls outside each company's franchise, because they do not have
an appropriate 'non-prime' or 'prime' product for such customers. However, there
can be no assurance that any such benefits will be realized at any particular
time in the future, or at all.

     Based solely on an arithmetic calculation excluding synergies, the merger
is expected to be accretive to earnings per share for 2003 on a U.K. GAAP basis.
Such calculation would be obtained by dividing the combined earnings of HSBC and
Household by the new number of HSBC ordinary shares in issue as a result of the
merger, and comparing the result to the existing earnings per share for HSBC. As
set forth under "HSBC and Household Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined
Financial Information," on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
adjustments necessary to reconcile Household's results from U.S. GAAP to U.K.
GAAP and the acquisition accounting adjustments, the merger would have been
accretive to basic and diluted earnings per HSBC ordinary share of the enlarged
HSBC Group for both the six months ended June 30, 2002 and the year ended
December 31, 2001.

INTERESTS OF HOUSEHOLD'S EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE MERGER

     Household's executive officers and directors have economic interests in the
merger in addition to the interest they share with you as a holder of Household
common stock generally.

     As described in detail below, there are substantial financial interests to
be conveyed to each executive officer of Household, including Messrs. Aldinger,
Schoenholz and Mehta, under the terms of either existing or new employment
agreements and due to the accelerated vesting of stock options and restricted
stock rights in respect of Household common stock. For instance, some of the
executive officers' stock options and shares of restricted stock will vest as a
result of the merger, and their Household stock options will become HSBC stock
options in the merger. Nine executive officers, including Mr. Aldinger, have
entered into new employment agreements with Household that will become effective
when the merger is completed, under which they will continue to have senior
management positions in Household, will receive payments and benefits under
their pre-existing employment agreements with Household, and will receive
compensation including salary, bonus and equity grants from HSBC following
completion of the merger. Mr. Aldinger will also become a member of the HSBC
board of directors following the merger. The merger will not result in the
accelerated vesting of any of the stock options to acquire shares of Household
common stock held by the non-employee directors of Household, although these
options will become HSBC stock options in the merger. Following the merger, HSBC
has agreed that Household will, subject to specified cost restrictions, maintain
directors' and officers' insurance for a six-year period following completion of
the merger covering the directors and officers of Household relating to events
occurring before completion of the merger.

     Household's board of directors was aware of these interests and considered
them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

     Mr. Aldinger's New Employment Agreement with Household.  At the request of
HSBC, Mr. Aldinger has entered into an agreement relating to his employment with
Household following completion of the merger. The term of Mr. Aldinger's
agreement will begin upon completion of the merger and will end on the third
anniversary of that date. Under the new employment agreement, Mr. Aldinger will
serve as chairman and chief executive officer of Household until January 1, 2004
and thereafter as chairman and chief executive officer of Household and HSBC
North America, Inc. The agreement further provides that, during its term, Mr.
Aldinger will serve as a member of the HSBC board of directors. During the term
of the agreement, Mr. Aldinger will be paid an annual base salary equal to his
annual base salary as of the date that the merger agreement was signed, and an
annual bonus in an amount at least equal to the annual average of Mr. Aldinger's
bonuses earned with respect to years 1999, 2000 and 2001 (pro rated for any
partial year).

     Within thirty days of completion of the merger, or, if the completion of
the merger occurs during the two-month period prior to March 3, 2003, within
thirty days after such date, subject to the approval of the trustee of HSBC's
Restricted Share Plan, Mr. Aldinger will receive a one-time special retention
grant of HSBC restricted shares with a value equal to $10 million, based on the
closing price of HSBC ordinary shares as of the date of grant. The special
restricted shares will vest in three equal installments on each of the first
three anniversaries of the completion of the merger, as long as Mr. Aldinger
remains employed on each applicable vesting date, subject to accelerated vesting
upon a termination of employment by Household without "cause," by Mr. Aldinger
for "good reason" or due to his death or disability. After each of the first and
second anniversaries of the completion of the merger, subject to the approval of
the trustee of HSBC's Restricted Share Plan, Mr. Aldinger will receive an
additional grant of restricted shares of HSBC with a value equal to at least
$5.5 million, based on the closing price of HSBC ordinary shares on the
applicable date of grant. These restricted shares will generally be subject to
the same terms and conditions as the special restricted share grant. To the
extent all or a portion of any of the foregoing grants of restricted shares
cannot be made under HSBC's Restricted Share Plan, Mr. Aldinger will receive a
cash bonus equal to the amount of the restricted share grant that he was not
able to receive, subject to the same general terms and conditions as the
restricted share grant.

     As described in the narrative above and summarized in the table below,
assuming the continued employment of Mr. Aldinger for the relevant periods under
the new employment agreement and the satisfaction of the other terms and
conditions of such agreement, he would be entitled to receive the following

                                        59
<PAGE>

amounts and interests: annual base salary of $1 million; annual bonus of $4
million; a special retention grant of HSBC restricted shares with a value of $10
million on the date of grant vesting in three equal annual installments; a grant
of HSBC restricted shares on or following each of the first two anniversaries of
the completion of the merger each with a value of $5.5 million on the date of
grant vesting in three equal annual installments.

</Table>

     During the term, except with respect to benefits under qualified and
non-qualified excess and supplemental defined benefit retirement plans, Mr.
Aldinger will receive employee benefits and perquisites that are no less
favorable than those provided to him immediately prior to the date of the merger
agreement. Effective as of the completion of the merger, Mr. Aldinger's benefits
under Household's qualified and non-qualified excess and supplemental defined
benefit retirement plans will be frozen, and Mr. Aldinger will be entitled to
receive the retirement benefits provided under his existing employment
agreement.

     Mr. Aldinger's new employment agreement provides that if his employment is
terminated during the term by him for "good reason," or by Household for reasons
other than "cause" or disability, he will be entitled to:

     - a pro rata target annual bonus for the fiscal year of the date of
       termination;

     - a payment equal to his annual base salary plus the average of his annual
       bonuses with respect to the three-year period ended 2001, times the
       number of full and partial months from the date of termination until the
       third anniversary of the completion of the merger, divided by twelve;

     - the immediate vesting and exercisability of each stock option, restricted
       stock award and other equity-based award or performance award (or cash
       equivalent) that is outstanding as of the date of termination and
       treatment as retirement eligible for purposes of exercising any such
       award;

     - for the remainder of his life and that of his current spouse, continued
       medical and dental benefits at Household's cost; and

     - his retirement benefits in a lump sum.

     If any payments or benefits that Mr. Aldinger receives are subject to the
excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, his
employment agreement provides for an additional payment to restore him to the
after-tax position that he would have been in had the excise tax not been
imposed.

     The new employment agreement also provides that, during his employment with
Household, and for a period of one year after the termination of his employment
for any reason, other than a termination of employment by Household without
"cause" or a resignation by Mr. Aldinger for "good reason," Mr. Aldinger may not
become associated with certain competitive entities that are actively engaged in
the consumer lending business (including mortgage and credit card lending) and
may not solicit the business of any entity that was a significant commercial
customer or client of Household and its subsidiaries during the six-month period
prior to his termination date. The new employment agreement also contains a
confidentiality provision and a restriction on Mr. Aldinger's ability to solicit
or hire Household employees following certain terminations of his employment.

     Upon completion of the merger, Mr. Aldinger's new employment agreement will
supersede his existing employment agreement with Household, and Mr. Aldinger's
employment under his existing employment agreement will be deemed to have been
terminated due to a "qualifying termination," entitling him to the cash payments
under that agreement. Please refer to "-- Existing Household Employment
Agreements and Employment Protection Agreements."

     New Executive Officer Employment Agreements with Household.  At the request
of HSBC, the following eight additional executive officers of Household have
entered into employment agreements relating to their employment with Household
following completion of the merger: Messrs. Schoenholz, Mehta, Detelich,
Friedrich, Harvey, Kelly and Robin and Ms. Derickson (whose positions with
Household following completion of the merger are set forth below). The term of
the new executive officer employment agreements will begin upon completion of
the merger and will end on the third anniversary of that date. Under the new
employment agreements, each executive will generally serve in the same position
that such executive held as of the date of the merger agreement. During the
term, each executive will be paid an annual base salary of not less than such
executive's annual base salary as of the date of the merger agreement and will
receive an annual bonus in an amount at least equal to 75% of the annual average
of such executive's bonuses earned with respect to the three-year period ended
December 31, 2001 (pro rated for any partial year). During the term, each of the
executives will be eligible to participate, as approved by the HSBC board, in
any equity-based incentive compensation plan or program of HSBC as in effect
from time to time for similarly situated senior executives of Household. In
addition, during the term, each executive will be eligible to participate in the
various retirement, welfare and fringe benefit plans, programs and arrangements
of Household, in accordance with the terms of such plans, programs and
arrangements, provided that they will not receive age and service credit under
the Household retirement plans that would be duplicative of the age and service
credit that they are entitled to under the existing employment agreements or
employee protection agreements, as applicable.

     Within thirty days of completion of the merger, or, if the completion of
the merger occurs during the two-month period prior to March 3, 2003, within
thirty days after such date, subject to the approval of the trustees of HSBC's
Restricted Share Plan, each of the executives will receive a one-time special
retention grant of HSBC restricted shares, vesting in equal annual installments
over a three- or five-year period, with the grant value and vesting period
applicable to each of the executive officers set forth below. Upon termination
of an executive's employment by Household without "cause" or by an executive as
a result of a material breach of the agreement by Household, the restricted
shares will immediately vest. To the extent all or a portion of the grant of
restricted shares cannot be made under HSBC's Restricted Share Plan, the
executive will receive a one-time cash bonus equal to the amount of the
restricted share grant that such executive was not able to receive, subject to
the same general terms and conditions as the restricted share grant.

     As described in the narrative above and summarized in the table below,
assuming the continued employment following the merger of each of Messrs.
Schoenholz, Mehta, Detelich, Friedrich, Harvey, Kelly and Robin and Ms.
Derickson for the relevant periods under the new employment agreements and the
satisfaction of the other terms and conditions of such agreements, each
executive would be entitled to receive the following amounts and interests:

     - Mr. Schoenholz (President and Chief Operating Officer): annual base
       salary of $650,000; annual bonus of $1.5 million; and a retention grant
       of HSBC restricted shares with a value of $3 million on the date of
       grant, vesting in three equal installments on each of the first three
       anniversaries of the completion of the merger.

     - Mr. Mehta (Group Executive): annual base salary of $550,000; annual bonus
       of $1.125 million; and a retention grant of HSBC restricted shares with a
       value of $5 million on the date of grant, vesting in five equal
       installments on each of the first five anniversaries of the completion of
       the merger.

     - Mr. Detelich (Group Executive): annual base salary of $500,000; annual
       bonus of $314,225; and a retention grant of HSBC restricted shares with a

       installments on each of the first five anniversaries of the completion of
       the merger.

     - Mr. Friedrich (Executive Vice President): annual base salary of $400,000;
       annual bonus of $393,750; and a retention grant of HSBC restricted shares
       with a value of $1.5 million on the date of grant, vesting in three equal
       installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the completion
       of the merger.

     - Mr. Harvey (Group Executive and Chief Information Officer): annual base
       salary of $500,000; annual bonus of $537,500; and a retention grant of
       HSBC restricted shares with a value of $5 million on the

                                        61
<PAGE>

       date of grant, vesting in five equal installments on each of the first
       five anniversaries of the completion of the merger.

     - Mr. Kelly (Executive Vice President, Administration): annual base salary

     If during the term of the new employment agreements, an executive's
employment is terminated by Household other than for "cause" or disability or by
the executive for "good reason," subject to the executive's execution of a
general release in favor of Household and its affiliates, the executive will
continue to receive the executive's base salary and the annual bonus described
above at the time and in the manner such payments would have been paid had the
executive remained employed for the remainder of the term, and to the extent
permitted under the terms of the applicable plans, the continuation of welfare
benefits, umbrella liability insurance and automobile and financial counseling
allowances from the date of termination until the earlier of the executive
becoming eligible to participate in similar plans of another employer and the
last day of the term.

     The new employment agreements also provide that, during their term and
during the one-year period following any resignation by the executive of
employment other than a resignation that results from a material breach of the
agreement by Household, the executive may not become associated with competitive
entities that are actively engaged in the consumer lending business (including
mortgage and credit card lending) and may not solicit the business of any entity
that was a significant commercial customer or client of Household and its
subsidiaries during the six-month period prior to the executive's termination
date. The new

                                        62
<PAGE>

employment agreements also contain a confidentiality provision and a restriction
on the executive's ability to solicit or hire Household employees following
terminations of the executive's employment under some conditions.

     Upon completion of the merger, these new employment agreements will
supersede each executive's existing employment agreement or employment
protection agreement, as applicable, with Household (except that the excise tax
gross-up provision in the existing agreements will survive), and each
executive's employment under the existing employment agreement or employment
protection agreement will be deemed to have been terminated due to a "qualifying
termination," entitling the executive to the cash payments thereunder. Please
refer to "-- Existing Household Employment Agreements and Employment Protection
Agreements."

     Existing Household Employment Agreements and Employment Protection
Agreements.

     The following executive officers of Household are each party to an
employment agreement that contains change of control severance provisions:
Messrs. Aldinger, Schoenholz, Mehta, Detelich, Harvey, Hill, Kelly and Robin.
Messrs. Friedrich and McDonald and Ms. Derickson are each party to an employment
protection agreement that contains a change of control severance provision.
Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, if, during the three-year period
(18-month period under the employment protection agreements) following a change
of control, the employment of a covered executive is terminated due to a
"qualifying termination," which includes a termination other than for "cause" or
disability, or by the covered executive for "good reason" (including a
termination of employment by an executive with an employment agreement for any
reason during the 60-day period after the 12-month anniversary of the change of
control or, in the case of Mr. Aldinger, during the three-year period following
the change of control), the covered executive will be entitled to receive a cash
payment consisting of:

     - a pro rata annual bonus through the date of termination, based on the
       highest of the annual bonuses payable to the executive during the three
       years preceding the year in which the termination occurs;

     - a payment equal to three times (1.5 times under the employment protection
       agreements) the sum of the covered executive's base salary and highest
       annual bonus; and

     - a payment equal to the value of three years (18 months under the
       employment protection agreements) of additional employer contributions
       under Household's tax-qualified and supplemental defined contribution
       plans.

     As described in the narrative above and summarized in the table below, upon
a qualifying termination following completion of the merger, Messrs. Aldinger,
Schoenholz, Mehta, Detelich, Friedrich, Harvey, Hill, Kelly, McDonald and Robin
and Ms. Derickson would be eligible to receive approximately the following
amounts in satisfaction of the cash severance obligations described above under
their existing agreements with Household: Mr. Aldinger -- $20.30 million; Mr.
Schoenholz -- $10.64 million; Mr. Mehta: $8.60 million; Mr. Detelich -- $1.58
million; Mr. Friedrich -- $1.83 million; Mr. Harvey -- $4.33 million; Mr.
Hill -- $2.98 million; Mr. Kelly -- $4.36 million; Mr. McDonald -- $1.15
million; Mr. Robin -- $4.36 million; Ms. Derickson -- $1.89 million; which
payments have an aggregate value of approximately $62 million.

     In addition, upon a qualifying termination following a change of control,
each covered executive will be entitled to continued welfare benefit coverage
for three years (18 months under the employment protection agreements) after the
date of termination, three years (18 months under the employment protection
agreements) of additional age and service credit under Household's tax-qualified
and supplemental defined benefit retirement plans, and outplacement services. If
any amounts or benefits received under the employment agreements, employment
protection agreements or otherwise are subject to the excise tax imposed under
section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, an additional payment will be made to
restore the executive to the after-tax position in which he or she would have
been if the excise tax had not been imposed.

 STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK RIGHTS

     Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding and unexercised stock
option to acquire shares of Household common stock held by any current or former
employee or director of Household will be assumed by HSBC and converted into,
and become a right to acquire, the number of HSBC ordinary shares (rounded to
the nearest whole HSBC ordinary share) equal to the number of shares of
Household common stock subject to the Household stock option multiplied by the
exchange ratio. The exercise price of each converted HSBC stock option (per HSBC
ordinary share) will equal the exercise price per share of the Household stock
option divided by the exchange ratio (rounded to the nearest whole cent). The
converted number of HSBC ordinary shares and related exercise price will be
adjusted as necessary pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code with respect to
stock options intended to qualify as "incentive stock options" under Section 422
of the Internal Revenue Code. Upon completion of the merger, each right to
receive shares of Household common stock, including Household restricted stock
rights, or benefits measured based on the value of Household common stock, will
cease to represent the right to receive shares of Household common stock or
benefits measured thereby and will be converted into, and become a right to
receive, the number of HSBC ordinary shares or benefits measured thereby
(rounded to the nearest whole HSBC ordinary share) equal to the product of the
number of shares of Household common stock subject to such Household right and
the exchange ratio. The converted HSBC stock options and other equity-based
awards will continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to them immediately prior to the completion of the merger. At or
prior to the time that the holder of a converted HSBC stock option or other
equity-based award is entitled to receive the HSBC ordinary shares underlying
such option or award, such holder will be entitled to choose whether to receive
HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs.

     Pursuant to the terms of the equity-based plans of Household and the award
agreements thereunder, stock options to acquire Household common stock and
Household restricted stock rights, including stock options and restricted stock
rights granted to Household's executive officers and directors, will fully vest
or become free of restrictions immediately prior to the merger becoming
effective, and the stock options granted under each of the Household long-term
incentive plans will remain exercisable until the expiration of their original
term. The Household equity-based plans and the award agreements thereunder
provide that stock options to acquire Household common stock and Household
restricted stock rights granted after November 14, 2002, including stock options
and restricted stock rights held by Household's executive officers, will not
vest or become free of restrictions upon completion of the merger; however,
these awards will vest upon a termination of employment by Household for a
reason other than due to death, disability or "cause" or by the employee for
"good reason." In light of the proposed merger, the non-employee directors of
Household waived their regular annual grant of stock options under the Household
1996 Long-Term Executive Incentive Plan (which would be automatically made on
the same date that the annual grants are awarded to employees generally), and
instead will receive, prior to the completion of the merger, a cash payment of
equivalent value.

                                        64
<PAGE>

     As summarized in the table below, assuming the merger is completed on March
31, 2003, stock options to acquire an aggregate of 2,143,125 shares of Household
common stock held by Household's executive officers will vest and become
exercisable as a result of the merger, which options have a weighted average
exercise price of $53.44, and an aggregate of 526,750 Household restricted stock
rights held by Household's executive officers will vest and become free of
restrictions as a result of the merger. The merger will not result in the
accelerated vesting of any of the stock options to acquire shares of Household
common stock held by the non-employee directors of Household, although these
options will become HSBC stock options in the merger, and none of the Household
non-employee directors are holders of restricted stock rights.

(1) Assuming the merger is completed on March 31, 2003.

(2) The lowest exercise price for the stock options to acquire Household common
    stock that will vest on completion of the merger is $45.38.

 INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

     In the merger agreement, HSBC has agreed that all rights to
indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring prior to the effective time of the merger now existing in
favor of current and former directors and officers of Household and its
subsidiaries as provided in their respective organizational documents and
indemnification arrangements will continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms after the effective time of the merger. Furthermore,
HSBC will cause the surviving company in the merger to, from the effective time
of the merger, indemnify each present and former director and officer of
Household and its subsidiaries in their capacities as such against all losses,
expenses, claims, damages or liabilities arising out of acts or omissions
occurring on or prior to the effective time of the merger, to the fullest extent
permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law and other applicable law.
In the event that the surviving corporation in the merger consolidates or merges
with another person and is not

                                        65
<PAGE>

the surviving entity, or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to
another person, HSBC has agreed that proper provision will be made so that the
successors and assigns of the surviving corporation will assume the obligations
described above.

     In the merger agreement, HSBC has further agreed that, for a period of six
years after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation in the
merger will maintain in effect policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance with coverage at least as favorable in amount and scope as the
policies maintained by Household and its subsidiaries on the date of the merger
agreement with respect to matters arising on or before the effective time of the
merger. However, HSBC is not obligated to pay aggregate premiums that exceed
250% of the aggregate premiums for this insurance paid by Household on an
annualized basis as of the date of the merger agreement. In the event that the
surviving corporation is unable to maintain such insurance, it will use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available
for the maximum premium indicated in the preceding sentence.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     HSBC intends to account for the merger using acquisition accounting under
U.K. GAAP. Under this method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of
Household will be recorded, as of the completion date of the merger, at their
respective fair values and added to those of HSBC. Financial statements and
reported results of operations of HSBC issued after consummation of the merger
will reflect these values, but prior HSBC financial statements will not be
restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results
of operations of Household.

     All unaudited pro forma financial information contained in this document
has been prepared using the acquisition method to account for the merger. Under
U.K. GAAP, the final determination of the purchase price is based on the price
of HSBC ordinary shares as of the date the merger is completed. In addition, the
final allocation of the purchase price will be determined after completion of a
thorough analysis to determine the fair values of Household's assets and
liabilities. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting adjustments and
goodwill may be materially different from those reflected in the unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial information presented in this document.

OTHER EFFECTS OF THE MERGER

     The content and timing of reports and notices that HSBC files with the SEC
differ in several respects from the reports and notices that Household currently
files. HSBC is, and following the merger will continue to be, a foreign private
issuer for the purposes of the reporting rules under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, or the Exchange Act.

     As a U.S. reporting company, Household must file with the SEC, among other
reports and notices:

     (1) an annual report on Form 10-K within 90 days (scheduled to be reduced
         to 60 days by December 15, 2004 under recently adopted SEC rules) after
         the end of each fiscal year;

     (2) quarterly reports on Form 10-Q within 45 days (scheduled to be reduced
         to 35 days by December 15, 2005 under recently adopted SEC rules) after
         the end of each fiscal quarter; and

     (3) reports on Form 8-K upon the occurrence of material corporate events.

     As a foreign private issuer, pursuant to the requirements of the Exchange
Act, HSBC is required to:

     (1) file with the SEC an annual report on Form 20-F within six months after
         the end of each fiscal year; and

     (2) furnish to the SEC reports on Form 6-K as required.

     HSBC is not required under the Exchange Act to file quarterly reports on
Form 10-Q after the end of each fiscal quarter.

                                        66
<PAGE>

     In addition, the content and timing of reports and notices that holders of
HSBC ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs receive differ from the reports and notices
that are currently received by Household stockholders. As a U.S. reporting
company, Household must mail to its stockholders in advance of each annual
meeting of stockholders:

     (1) an annual report containing audited financial statements; and

     (2) a proxy statement that complies with the requirements of the Exchange
         Act.

     As a foreign private issuer, HSBC will, following the merger, continue to
be exempt from the rules under the Exchange Act prescribing the furnishing and
content of annual reports and proxy statements to its shareholders, but will
continue to be required to file with the SEC annual reports on Form 20-F, and
reports on Form 6-K as required and to make other filings as required by English
and Hong Kong SAR law or regulatory requirements. HSBC sends HSBC ordinary
shareholders and HSBC ADS holders a copy of its annual report and accounts or a
summary thereof. For additional information, please refer to "Description of
HSBC Ordinary Shares" and "Description of HSBC American Depositary Shares."

     If the merger is completed, the Household common stock and each series of
Household preferred stock will be delisted from the NYSE and will be
deregistered under the Exchange Act. It is also expected that Household will no
longer be a reporting company under the Exchange Act.

     Household common stock is presently included in the S&P 500 Index. Mutual
funds and other investment vehicles whose investment objective is to track the
performance of the S&P 500 Index currently hold a substantial amount of
Household common stock. These funds will be required to sell their Household
stock (or the HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs they receive in the merger) as a
result of Household's removal from the S&P 500 Index. These sales could
adversely affect the market price for the HSBC ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs.

     In addition, after the merger the relative weight of HSBC in the U.K.
series of the Financial Times Stock Exchange Actuaries Indices is expected to
increase and may increase on other global indices. As a result, pension funds,
unit trusts and other investment vehicles whose investment objective is to track
the performance of these indices are likely to increase their holdings of HSBC
ordinary shares.

LITIGATION RELATING TO THE MERGER

     Several lawsuits have been filed alleging violations of law with respect to
the merger. These lawsuits are described below. The lawsuits are in their
preliminary stages; Household believes that the claims against it lack merit and
intends to defend the lawsuits vigorously.

     Two of the lawsuits are pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County,
Illinois, Chancery Division. One, McLaughlin v. Aldinger et al., No. 02 CH
20683, asserts claims on behalf of a purported class of holders of Household
common stock against Household and some of its officers and directors for breach
of fiduciary duty in connection with the merger on the grounds that the
defendants allegedly failed to take appropriate steps to maximize the value of a
merger transaction for holders of Household common stock. The McLaughlin
complaint contends that plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm unless the
merger is enjoined, but seeks only damages. The other, Pace v. Aldinger et al.
No. 02 CH 19270, is both a derivative lawsuit on behalf of Household and a
purported class action on behalf of holders of Household common stock. This
lawsuit was filed prior to the announcement of the merger and originally
asserted claims relating to Household's pre-merger accounting practices. It has
since been amended to allege that Household and some of its officers and
directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger and,
among other things, seeks to enjoin the merger.

     A third lawsuit relating to the merger, Williamson v. Aldinger et al., No.
03 C00331, is pending in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Illinois. This derivative lawsuit on behalf of Household claims that
some of Household's officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties and
committed corporate waste by agreeing to the merger and allegedly failing to
take appropriate steps to maximize the value of a merger transaction. The
complaint seeks to enjoin the merger.

                               REGULATORY MATTERS

     HSBC and Household have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain all regulatory approvals required to complete the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. While HSBC and Household
believe that they will be able to obtain these regulatory approvals, HSBC and
Household cannot predict whether the required regulatory approvals will be
obtained within the time frame contemplated by the merger agreement or on
conditions that would not be detrimental to HSBC or Household, or whether these
approvals will be obtained at all. Under the merger agreement, in connection
with obtaining these approvals HSBC is not required to agree to, or to permit
Household to agree to, any limitation, divestiture or condition that would
materially and adversely impact HSBC or Household. HSBC and Household are not
aware of any other material governmental approvals or actions that are required
prior to completion of the acquisition other than those described below.

U.S. ANTITRUST

     Transactions like the merger are reviewed by the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice, which we refer to as the Antitrust
Division, or the United States Federal Trade Commission, which we refer to as
the FTC, to determine whether they comply with applicable antitrust law. Under
the provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and
the related rules, the merger cannot be completed until both HSBC and Household
furnish information and materials to the Antitrust Division and the FTC and a
required waiting period has ended. On November 27, 2002, HSBC and Household
filed their pre-merger notification and report forms with the Antitrust
Division. Early termination of the waiting period was granted effective December
16, 2002.

     Even after the termination of the waiting period, at any time before or
after the acquisition is completed, the Antitrust Division, the FTC or any state
could take action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in
the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the acquisition or seeking
divestiture of substantial assets of HSBC or Household or their subsidiaries.
Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws
under some circumstances. Based upon an examination of information available
relating to the businesses in which the parties are engaged, HSBC and Household
believe that the completion of the merger will not violate U.S. antitrust laws.
However, HSBC and Household can give no assurance that a challenge to the merger
on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if a challenge is made, of the result.

OTHER U.S. REGULATORY MATTERS

     Applications or notifications are also required to be filed with various
state banking departments in connection with the change in control of
Household's subsidiaries that act as mortgage bankers, sales finance companies
or licensed lenders, or that engage in other consumer finance activities. These
authorities may disapprove the change in control of such subsidiaries based upon
the criteria set forth in the applicable laws and regulations. Applications were
submitted by HSBC on November 27, 2002 to the New York State Banking Department
for approval of the change in control of those of Household's subsidiaries that
are licensed to engage in consumer financing activities in New York. The
Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York is required to render a
decision with respect to such applications within 90 days after acceptance of
the applications, unless such deadline is extended. Applications or appropriate
notifications have also been filed in all other states that require such filings
including Tennessee, Illinois, Maryland, Wisconsin, Oklahoma and Delaware.

     The change in control of Household's subsidiaries that act as insurance
underwriters or agencies is also subject to the receipt of necessary approvals
from various U.S. state insurance regulatory authorities. The insurance laws and
regulations of most states generally require that, to proceed with the
acquisition of control of an insurance company domiciled in a state through the
acquisition of or merger with the holding company parent of the insurance
company, the acquiror must obtain the prior approval of the insurance regulatory
authority of that state. In this regard, completion of the merger is subject to
the prior approval of the insurance regulatory authorities of Arizona, Delaware,
Michigan, New York and Ohio and applications are being made

                                        68
<PAGE>

to the insurance departments of those states. In addition, notices have been
sent to insurance regulators in other, non-domiciliary states notifying them of
the merger. No prior approval is required by these states.

     In order to complete the merger, HSBC must also obtain the approval of the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or OCC, under the Change in Bank
Control Act for the change in control of Household Bank (SB), N.A., a limited
purpose credit card bank and a subsidiary of Household. HSBC filed a Change in
Bank Control Act notice with the OCC on November 27, 2002. A decision by the OCC
is expected to be received within 60 days of the date as of which the notice is
deemed complete, unless the review period is extended.

UNITED KINGDOM

     The merger is conditioned on confirmation having been received by HSBC from
the U.K. Office of Fair Trading, in terms reasonably satisfactory to HSBC, that
the U.K.'s Secretary of State for Trade and Industry does not intend to refer
the merger to the U.K.'s Competition Commission.

     HSBC and Household notified the Office of Fair Trading of the merger on
November 29, 2002 by way of a prescribed statutory merger notice, under the
merger control provisions of the Fair Trading Act 1973. The U.K.'s Secretary of
State announced on January 17, 2003 that she has decided not to refer the merger
to the U.K.'s Competition Commission.

     The merger is conditioned, under the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000, on the approval of the U.K. Financial Services Authority, or FSA. HSBC is
obliged to notify the FSA of the merger because it would result in HSBC holding
10% or more of the shares in a parent undertaking, and therefore acquiring
"control" of a U.K. authorized person (HFC Bank plc, Hamilton Insurance Company
Limited and Hamilton Life Assurance Company Limited). Applications were filed
with the FSA on December 6, 2002, and the FSA has a maximum period of three
months to determine whether to approve the change of control or whether to
impose such conditions as it considers appropriate.

CANADA

     HSBC is required to file an application with the Canadian Office of the
Superintendent of Financial Institutions for prior approval of the indirect
acquisition of Household's Canadian subsidiaries, which was made on January 15,
2003.

     HSBC and Household filed a pre-notification as required under the Canadian
Competition Act in connection with the change in control of Household's Canadian
subsidiaries. It is anticipated that the Competition Bureau will complete its
review on February 28, 2003.

EUROPEAN UNION MERGER REGULATION

     Notification to the European Commission is not required under the European
Union Merger Regulation.

OTHER INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY MATTERS

     In addition to the required filings in the United States, the United
Kingdom and Canada, an application for change in control of Household's
subsidiaries in the Republic of Ireland has been filed and approval has been
granted. An antitrust filing has been made in the Federal Republic of Germany
and the German Federal Cartel Office has determined that the merger does not
have any effect on the German domestic market and so no further consideration is
required. An antitrust filing has also been made in the Republic of Ireland and
confirmation has been received that no order is to be made under relevant
legislation. In addition, HSBC and Household conduct operations in a number of
other jurisdictions and HSBC and Household are currently reviewing whether other
filings or approvals may be required or desirable in these other jurisdictions
in connection with the completion of the merger.

           MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX AND U.K. TAX CONSEQUENCES

GENERAL

     The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger to Household stockholders and the material U.S.
federal income tax consequences and U.K. tax consequences related to the
ownership of HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs.

     The discussion does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all
the U.S. federal income tax or U.K. tax consequences that may be relevant to any
particular Household stockholder, including tax consequences that arise from
rules of general application or that are generally assumed to be known by
stockholders. In particular, the discussion deals only with holders that hold
their Household common stock or preferred stock, and will hold their HSBC
ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs, as capital assets. The discussion does not address
the tax treatment of Household stockholders that are subject to special rules,
such as stockholders:

     - that are banks, insurance companies, dealers in securities or persons
       that elect mark-to-market treatment,

     - that hold their Household stock or will hold their HSBC ordinary shares
       or HSBC ADSs as a position in part of a straddle, conversion transaction,
       constructive sale or other integrated investment comprised of one or more
       other investments,

     - that hold both Household preferred stock and Household common stock,

     - who own or will own, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of HSBC's voting
       shares,

     - whose "functional currency" is not the U.S. dollar,

     - who exercise their right to dissent from the merger,

     - who received their Household stock by exercising employee stock options
       or otherwise as compensation,

     - who are resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom for U.K.
       tax purposes, or

     - who will hold their HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs for the purposes of
       a trade, profession or vocation carried on in the United Kingdom through
       a branch or agency.

     In addition, this discussion does not address U.S. holders (as described
below) of Household stock who will own 5% or more of the HSBC ordinary shares,
measured by vote or value, either directly or indirectly through attribution
rules, immediately after the merger, because those shareholders are subject to
special U.S. federal income tax rules, would generally be required to enter into
a "gain recognition agreement" with the Internal Revenue Service, and may be
required to recognize taxable gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
in respect of the transaction in some circumstances.

     This discussion also does not address U.S. state or local taxation or
taxation by countries other than the United States and the United Kingdom.

     This discussion is based on existing U.S. federal income tax law and U.K.
tax law, including statutes, regulations, administrative rulings and court
decisions, all as in effect on the date of this document. All of these
authorities are subject to change, or change in interpretation (possibly with
retroactive effect). The discussion assumes that the merger will be completed in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. Any change in any of the
foregoing authorities or failure of the assumptions to be true could alter the
tax consequences discussed below.

     Household stockholders should consult their own tax advisers as to the U.S.
federal income tax, U.K. tax and other tax consequences to them of the merger
and the ownership and disposition of HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs,
including the income tax consequences arising from their own unique facts and
circum-

                                        70
<PAGE>

stances, and including any estate, inheritance, gift, state, local or non-U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the merger.

     As used in this discussion, the term "U.S. holder" means, before the
merger, a beneficial owner of Household common stock or preferred stock, and,
after the merger, a beneficial owner of HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs, who
is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

     - an individual U.S. citizen or resident,

     - a U.S. corporation, or

     - otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis in
       respect of Household common stock or preferred stock or HSBC ordinary
       shares or HSBC ADSs.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO U.S. HOLDERS OF HOUSEHOLD
STOCK

     The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax
consequences related to the merger. This discussion applies to you only if you
are a U.S. holder.

  TAX OPINION

     The obligation of Household to complete the merger is conditioned upon
Household's receipt of an opinion from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, and the
obligation of HSBC to complete the merger is conditioned upon HSBC's receipt of
an opinion from Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, in each case to be delivered
at the time of the merger and substantially to the effect that the merger will
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the U.S. tax
code and that each transfer of property to HSBC by a stockholder of Household
pursuant to the merger will not be subject to Section 367(a)(1) of the U.S. tax
code.

     In addition, in connection with the mailing of this document to
stockholders of Household, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Cleary, Gottlieb,
Steen & Hamilton have delivered to Household and HSBC, respectively, their
opinions, dated the date of this document, with each opinion providing that (1)
the merger will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the U.S. tax code, (2)
each transfer of property to HSBC by a stockholder of Household pursuant to the
merger will not be subject to Section 367(a)(1) of the U.S. tax code and (3) the
U.S. holders of Household common stock will not recognize any taxable gain or
loss on the exchange of their stock for HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs, but
will recognize a taxable gain or loss in respect of any cash received instead of
a fractional HSBC ordinary share (or fractional HSBC ADS) that they would
otherwise be entitled to receive.

     Each of these tax opinions will be based on assumptions noted in such
opinion and on representations of Household and HSBC contained in certificates
signed by officers of Household and HSBC. Accordingly, subject to the
limitations and qualifications set forth herein, the following discussion, to
the extent it describes matters of law and legal conclusions, constitutes the
opinion of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton
as to the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to you
under the law in effect as of the date of this document.

  U.S. HOLDERS OF HOUSEHOLD COMMON STOCK

     If you are a U.S. holder of Household common stock, you will not recognize
any taxable gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon your receipt
of HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs in the merger. However, different rules
apply to any cash received in lieu of fractional HSBC ordinary shares or
fractional HSBC ADSs in the merger, as discussed further below.

     The aggregate tax basis of the HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs received
by you in the merger, including any fractional share interests to which you
would be entitled but for the special treatment of fractional share interests
described below, will equal the aggregate tax basis of the Household common
stock exchanged for HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs. The holding period of
such HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs will include the holding period of the
Household common stock exchanged therefor.

                                        71
<PAGE>

     Fractional interests in HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs will not be
issued to Household stockholders in the merger. Instead, any fractional share
interests that Household stockholders otherwise would have been entitled to
receive will be sold and the proceeds will be paid to those shareholders. If you
receive cash in respect of a fractional interest in an HSBC ordinary share or
HSBC ADS, you will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference
between the amount of cash received for the fractional share interest and your
tax basis in the Household common stock exchanged which is allocable to the
fractional share interest. Any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain
or loss, and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss with respect to
Household common stock held for more than 12 months at the completion of the
merger.

  U.S. HOLDERS OF HOUSEHOLD PREFERRED STOCK

     Whether your preferred stock is being converted into the right to receive
cash in the merger or being redeemed effective immediately prior to the merger,
you will recognize taxable gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
equal to the difference between the amount of cash received for your Household
preferred stock and your tax basis in that stock. Any such gain or loss
generally will be capital gain or loss, and generally will be long-term capital
gain or loss with respect to Household preferred stock held for more than 12
months at the completion of the merger.

  U.S. INFORMATION REPORTING AND BACKUP WITHHOLDING

     You may be subject, under some circumstances, to information reporting and
possibly backup withholding with respect to the amount of cash received unless
you provide proof of an applicable exemption or a correct taxpayer
identification number and otherwise comply with applicable requirements of the
backup withholding rules. Any amount withheld under the backup withholding rules
is not an additional tax and may be refunded or credited against your federal
income tax liability, so long as the required information is furnished to the
Internal Revenue Service.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX AND U.K. TAX CONSEQUENCES FOR U.S. HOLDERS OF HSBC
ORDINARY SHARES AND HSBC ADSS

     The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax and
U.K. tax consequences related to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of
HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs. Except for the summaries under "-- U.K. Stamp
Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax," this discussion applies to you only if you are
a U.S. holder that is not resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom
and will not hold HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs for the purposes of a trade,
profession or vocation carried on in the United Kingdom through a branch or
agency.

  U.K. TAXATION OF DIVIDENDS

     Dividends that you receive on HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs will not be
subject to any U.K. withholding tax.

  U.K. TAXATION OF DISPOSITIONS

     Dispositions of HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs that you make will not
give rise to any U.K. tax on chargeable gains.

  U.K. STAMP DUTY AND STAMP DUTY RESERVE TAX

     U.K. stamp duty is generally chargeable on documents effecting the transfer
of U.K. shares. Where no such document is created, or stamp duty is not paid, an
equivalent liability to stamp duty reserve tax, or SDRT, may arise. SDRT may
also arise on the issue of shares into a clearance system, or as set forth
below.

     In general, a transfer or issue of HSBC ordinary shares to the depositary
in exchange for HSBC ADSs is subject to stamp duty or SDRT. For this purpose,
the current rate of stamp duty and SDRT is 1.5% (rounded up, in the case of
stamp duty, to the nearest L5). The rate is applied, in each case, to the amount
or value of the consideration given for the transfer of the HSBC ordinary shares
or the value of the shares if there is no

                                        72
<PAGE>

such consideration, or their issue price. To the extent that such stamp duty is
paid on any such transfer of HSBC ordinary shares, no SDRT should be payable on
that transfer.

     Under the merger agreement, H2 Acquisition Corporation has agreed to pay
any U.K. stamp duty and SDRT which becomes payable on the proposed merger,
including stamp duty and SDRT on the issue of HSBC ADSs and HSBC ordinary
shares. This will, however, apply only in relation to issuances of HSBC ADSs
that Household stockholders elect to receive as merger consideration by so
specifying in a duly executed letter of transmittal or that are issued upon
exercise of existing Household stock options that are assumed by HSBC.
Furthermore, H2 Acquisition Corporation will not pay any incremental stamp duty
or SDRT that arises where a letter of transmittal is submitted by someone other
than the Household stockholder to whom the letter of transmittal has been
addressed. Where HSBC ordinary shares are later transferred to the depositary,
or a nominee of that depositary, U.K. stamp duty or SDRT will be payable by the
holder of those HSBC ordinary shares as described above.

     Provided that the instrument of transfer is not executed in the United
Kingdom and remains at all subsequent times outside the United Kingdom, no U.K.
stamp duty will be required to be paid on any transfer of HSBC ADSs. An
agreement to transfer HSBC ADSs will not give rise to a liability for SDRT.

     The transfer for value of HSBC ordinary shares, as opposed to HSBC ADSs,
will generally give rise to U.K. stamp duty or SDRT at the rate of 0.5% (rounded
up, in the case of stamp duty, to the nearest L5). The rate is applied to the
price payable for the relevant HSBC ordinary shares. A transfer of ordinary
shares from a nominee into the name of their beneficial owner, including the
transfer of underlying HSBC ordinary shares from the depositary to an HSBC ADS
holder, is subject to stamp duty at the fixed rate of L5 per transfer.

     SDRT is generally the liability of the purchaser and U.K. stamp duty is
usually paid by the purchaser.

  U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF HSBC ADSs

     If you hold HSBC ordinary shares in HSBC ADS form, you will be treated as
holding the underlying ordinary shares for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and
deposits and withdrawals of ordinary shares in exchange for HSBC ADSs will not
be taxable events.

  U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF DIVIDENDS

     You must include cash dividends paid on ordinary shares in ordinary income
on the date that you or the HSBC ADS depositary receives them. Dividends paid by
HSBC will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction available to some
U.S. corporate holders.

     If you qualify for benefits under the current income tax treaty in effect
between the United States and the United Kingdom, you will be eligible, subject
to generally applicable limitations, to receive a special foreign tax credit
equal to one-ninth of the amount of cash dividends that you receive on the HSBC
ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs, so long as you make an election to include in
income, as an additional notional dividend, an amount equal to the tax credit.
You should consult your tax adviser with respect to this special foreign tax
credit, and should note that the United States has signed, but not ratified, a
new income tax treaty with the United Kingdom that would eliminate this benefit.

  U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF DISPOSITIONS

     You will generally recognize taxable capital gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes upon the sale or exchange of HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC
ADSs, measured by the difference between the amount received and your tax basis
in the HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs. Such gain or loss will be long-term
capital gain or loss if you have held the HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs for
more than one year, including the holding period for any Household common stock
exchanged for such HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs.

  U.S. INFORMATION REPORTING AND BACKUP WITHHOLDING

     You may be subject, under some circumstances, to information reporting and
possibly backup withholding with respect to dividends and proceeds from the sale
or other disposition of HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs, unless you provide
proof of an applicable exemption or correct taxpayer identification number

                                        73
<PAGE>

and otherwise comply with applicable requirements of the backup withholding
rules. Any amount withheld under the backup withholding rules is not additional
tax and may be refunded or credited against your federal income tax liability,
so long as the required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue
Service.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES FOR NON-U.S. HOLDERS

     The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax
consequences of acquiring, holding, and disposing of HSBC ordinary shares or
HSBC ADSs by you if you are, with respect to the United States, a foreign
corporation or a non-resident alien individual.

  U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO NON-U.S. HOLDERS OF
  HOUSEHOLD STOCK

     You will not recognize taxable gain or loss on your exchange of Household
common stock for HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs. You also will not recognize
taxable gain on your receipt of cash instead of fractional HSBC ordinary shares
or HSBC ADSs or your receipt of cash in exchange for Household preferred stock,
unless

     - the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or
       business in the United States, or

     - if you are an individual, you are present in the United States for 183
       days or more in the taxable year of the merger and other conditions are
       met.

     Payments of cash to you generally are not subject to information reporting
or backup withholding. You may, however, be required to provide certification of
your non-U.S. status to establish your exemption from information reporting and
backup withholding.

  U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF NON-U.S. HOLDERS OF HSBC ORDINARY SHARES
  OR HSBC ADSs

     You generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on dividends
paid on HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs, unless the dividends are effectively
connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States.

     You also will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain
realized on a sale or exchange of HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs, unless

     - the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or
       business in the United States, or

     - if you are an individual, you are present in the United States for 183
       days or more in the taxable year of the sale or exchange and other
       conditions are met.

     Payments of dividends or proceeds from the disposition of HSBC ordinary
shares or HSBC ADSs generally are not subject to information reporting or backup
withholding. You may, however, be required to provide certification of your
non-U.S. status in connection with payments received within the United States or
from the HSBC ADS depositary or other U.S. related payors to establish your
exemption from information reporting and backup withholding.

U.K. TAX CONSEQUENCES FOR NON-U.S. HOLDERS NOT RESIDENT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM

     Subject to the comments in the following paragraph, a holder that is not a
U.S. holder and who is not resident in the United Kingdom, or a non-U.K. foreign
holder, will generally be treated for U.K. tax purposes in respect of his or her
holding of HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs in the same way that U.S. holders
are treated for U.K. tax purposes. Please refer to "-- U.S. Federal Income Tax
and U.K. Tax Consequences for U.S. Holders of HSBC Ordinary Shares and HSBC
ADSs".

     Non-U.K. foreign holders should note that they will not generally have the
benefit of the income tax treaty in effect between the United States and the
United Kingdom in relation to their holding of HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC
ADSs, although they may have the benefit of another applicable income tax treaty
between the United Kingdom and the country in which they are resident.

     Non-U.K. foreign holders should seek advice from an independent tax adviser
about the tax consequences of the proposed merger and of holding and disposing
of HSBC ordinary shares or ADRs representing HSBC ADSs.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     HSBC and Household believe that this summary describes all of the material
terms of the merger agreement. However, because the merger agreement is the
primary legal document that governs the merger, you should carefully read the
complete text of the merger agreement for its precise legal terms and other
information that may be important to you. The merger agreement is included as
Annex A to this document and is incorporated by reference in this document.

FORM OF THE MERGER

     If all of the conditions to the merger are satisfied or waived in
accordance with the merger agreement, Household will merge with and into H2
Acquisition Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC created solely for
the purpose of giving effect to the merger, and the separate corporate existence
of Household will cease. H2 Acquisition Corporation will be the surviving
corporation in the merger and will continue its corporate existence under
Delaware law. The Certificate of Incorporation and by-laws of H2 Acquisition
Corporation as in effect immediately prior to the effective time will be the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the surviving corporation.

EFFECTIVE TIME AND TIMING OF CLOSING

     The merger agreement provides that the merger will be completed on the
fifth business day following the first day on which all conditions in the merger
agreement have been fulfilled or waived. If the closing date would occur within
five business days of the last day of a calendar month, HSBC may at its option,
upon waiving specified conditions to the merger, delay the closing date until
the last day of the calendar month.

     The merger will become effective when HSBC and Household file a certificate
of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at a later
time if so specified in the certificate of merger. Although HSBC and Household
expect to complete the merger by the end of the first quarter of 2003, the
merger is subject to regulatory approvals in a number of jurisdictions and the
companies cannot predict the exact time of the merger's completion. For more
information about regulatory approvals to which the merger is subject, please
refer to "Regulatory Matters."

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

     The directors of H2 Acquisition Corporation will continue to be the
directors of the surviving corporation following the merger. The officers of
Household immediately prior to the merger will become the officers of the
surviving corporation following the merger.

CONSIDERATION TO BE RECEIVED IN THE MERGER

     Upon completion of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of
Household common stock will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive, at the election of the holder, 2.675 HSBC ordinary shares or 0.535 HSBC
ADSs (each HSBC ADS representing an ownership interest in five HSBC ordinary
shares). For more information about the characteristics of and difference
between HSBC ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs, please refer to "Description of HSBC
Ordinary Shares" and "Description of HSBC American Depositary Shares."

     Upon completion of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of
Household non-voting preferred stock will be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive cash in the amount of $1,000 per share ($25 per depositary
share representing 1/40th of a share), plus all accrued and unpaid dividends up
to but excluding the closing date, without interest. Holders of Household
non-voting preferred stock are entitled to assert dissenters' appraisal rights
instead of receiving this consideration. For a description of these dissenters'
rights, please refer to "Appraisal Rights."

     All shares of Household common stock and non-voting preferred stock will no
longer be outstanding following the merger and will be cancelled and retired and
will cease to exist. If you are a holder of a certificate

                                        75
<PAGE>

representing those shares you will no longer have any rights with respect to
those shares except the right to receive HSBC ordinary shares, HSBC ADSs and/or
cash as described above or, if applicable, appraisal rights.

     Pursuant to their terms, the outstanding 8.875% Adjustable Conversion-Rate
Equity Securities Units will remain outstanding following the merger, with the
purchase contract portion of such Units to be converted, as a result of the
merger, into contracts to purchase HSBC ordinary shares in lieu of shares of
Household common stock.

     Pursuant to their terms, the rights to subscribe for shares of Household
common stock under the zero-coupon convertible debt securities of Household will
be converted, as a result of the merger, into rights to subscribe for HSBC
ordinary shares.

REDEMPTION OF HOUSEHOLD VOTING PREFERRED STOCK

     Immediately prior to closing and as a condition to HSBC's obligation to
proceed with the merger, Household will deposit the redemption price of the
Household voting preferred stock in trust for the holders of the shares, and
will take the other steps required to redeem the shares in accordance with their
terms. As provided in the certificates of designation governing these shares of
preferred stock, upon the deposit in trust of the redemption price these shares
will no longer be deemed to be outstanding. The aggregate amount of the
redemption price of the Household voting preferred stock outstanding as of the
date of this document is $114.8 million, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to
the date of redemption.

SHARE ELECTION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES; FRACTIONAL SHARES

     HSBC has appointed Computershare Investor Services LLC as exchange agent
for the purpose of exchanging certificates formerly representing shares of
Household common stock and non-voting preferred stock for, as applicable, HSBC
ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs or cash. The exchange agent will mail to each
holder of record of Household common stock or non-voting preferred stock a
letter of transmittal for use in effecting delivery of certificates representing
these shares to the exchange agent. The letter of transmittal will require each
holder of Household common stock to make an election to receive either HSBC
ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs. If a holder of Household common stock does not
make an election, the exchange agent will return the letter of transmittal to
the holder for completion. If a holder of Household common stock elects to
receive HSBC ordinary shares, the holder will receive the HSBC ordinary shares
in certificated form unless the holder elects in the letter of transmittal to
receive them in uncertificated form through CREST.

     Upon surrender of a certificate representing Household common stock for
cancellation to the exchange agent together with a duly executed letter of
transmittal, the holder will be entitled to receive in exchange:

     - the whole number of HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs that the Household
       common stockholder has the right to receive pursuant to the merger
       agreement;

     - the amount of any cash in lieu of fractional HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC
       ADSs as described below, and

     - any dividends or other distributions on the HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC
       ADSs, as applicable, that have a record date after the date of completion
       of the merger and shall have been declared and paid prior to the exchange
       (in the event that a dividend or other distribution has a record date
       after the completion of the merger and has been declared but not yet paid
       prior to the exchange, the holder will be entitled to be paid such
       dividend or other distribution at the same time as all other holders of
       HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs).

     Upon surrender of a certificate for a depositary share representing 1/40th
of a share of Household non-voting preferred stock for cancellation to the
exchange agent together with a duly executed letter of transmittal, the holder
will be entitled to receive in exchange:

     - cash in the amount of $25 per depositary share, and

     - all accrued and unpaid dividends up to but excluding the closing date,
       without interest.

                                        76
<PAGE>

     With respect to both common stock and preferred stock, taxes will be
withheld as required.

     Household certificates that are surrendered will be cancelled. No interest
will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon surrender of stock
certificates. No holder of unsurrendered certificates will receive any dividends
or other distributions with respect to HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs to
which the holder is entitled under the merger agreement, or be entitled to vote
such HSBC ordinary shares, until the Household certificate registered to the
holder is surrendered to the exchange agent.

     YOU SHOULD NOT SEND YOUR HOUSEHOLD STOCK CERTIFICATES TO THE EXCHANGE AGENT
UNTIL YOU HAVE RECEIVED TRANSMITTAL MATERIALS FROM THE EXCHANGE AGENT. DO NOT
RETURN HOUSEHOLD STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH THE ENCLOSED PROXY.

     HOLDERS OF SHARES OF VOTING PREFERRED STOCK SHOULD NOT SEND SHARE
CERTIFICATES TO THE EXCHANGE AGENT. THESE SHARES WILL BE DESIGNATED FOR
REDEMPTION BY HOUSEHOLD EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE MERGER, AND THE
HOLDERS OF THESE SHARES SHOULD FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS INCLUDED IN THE NOTICE OF
REDEMPTION THEY WILL RECEIVE FROM HOUSEHOLD.

     HSBC will not issue fractional ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs to holders of
Household common stock in the merger. Instead, at HSBC's election (which must be
made prior to the effective time of the merger):

     - the exchange agent will aggregate and sell from time to time on the LSE
       the fractional HSBC ordinary shares (including HSBC ordinary shares
       underlying fractional HSBC ADSs) that would otherwise be issued. For each
       fractional HSBC ordinary share or HSBC ADS that otherwise would have been
       issued to you, you will receive a proportionate interest in the net
       proceeds (after commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket
       transaction costs, including customary expenses of the exchange agent) of
       these sales. Because fractional shares will be aggregated and sold from
       time to time after completion of the merger as shares of Household common
       stock are surrendered for exchange, the market value of an HSBC ordinary
       share upon which this cash amount is based will vary and, depending on
       when you surrender your Household common stock for exchange, you may
       receive more or less cash with respect to a fractional HSBC ordinary
       share or HSBC ADS than a Household common stockholder who surrenders
       shares at a different time and you will have no recourse against HSBC,
       Household, the exchange agent, the depositary or any other person as a
       result of the difference; or

     - HSBC will pay you an amount in cash equal to (A) the fractional share
       interest to which you would be entitled (after taking into account all
       shares of Household common stock held by you as of the effective time),
       multiplied by (B) (x) the closing mid-market price (disregarding extended
       hours) on the date of the completion of the merger of HSBC ordinary
       shares (as reported in the Daily Official List of the LSE), if you have
       elected to receive HSBC ordinary shares, or (y) the closing price
       (disregarding extended hours) of HSBC ADSs (as reported on the NYSE
       Composite Transaction Tape (as reported in the Wall Street Journal
       (National Edition), or, if not reported therein, any other authoritative
       source)) if you have elected to receive HSBC ADSs.

     No interest will be paid in respect of cash paid in lieu of a fractional
HSBC ordinary share or HSBC ADS or any dividends or distributions declared or
paid on the HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs issued in the merger.

     Immediately following the merger, Household's transfer books will be closed
and there will be no transfers on Household's transfer books of Household common
stock or preferred stock outstanding before the merger.

     The merger agreement provides that if any certificates representing shares
of Household common stock or non-voting preferred stock have not been
surrendered within 12 months after completion of the merger, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, the rights of these holders will cease and they
will no longer be entitled to receive HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs or cash,
as the case may be. If the surviving corporation requests, the exchange agent
will sell any remaining HSBC ordinary shares on the LSE and the proceeds from
those sales, together with any remaining cash representing unpaid payments to
holders of Household non-voting preferred stock, will be paid to the surviving
corporation as soon as practicable. Applicable state escheat laws may require
that unclaimed merger consideration be surrendered to appropriate state
authorities.

                                        77
<PAGE>

     If any of your Household share certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, you will be entitled to obtain the applicable merger consideration
after you make an affidavit of that fact and post a bond in a customary amount
to protect HSBC against claims related to your lost, stolen or destroyed stock
certificates.

STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER EQUITY-BASED AWARDS

     Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding and unexercised stock
option to acquire shares of Household common stock held by any current or former
employee or director of Household will be assumed by HSBC and converted into,
and become a right to acquire, the number of HSBC ordinary shares (rounded to
the nearest whole HSBC ordinary share) equal to the number of shares of
Household common stock subject to the Household stock option multiplied by the
exchange ratio. The exercise price of each converted HSBC stock option (per HSBC
ordinary share) will equal the exercise price per share of the Household stock
option divided by the exchange ratio (rounded to the nearest whole cent). The
converted number of HSBC ordinary shares and related exercise price will be
adjusted as necessary pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code with respect to
stock options intended to qualify as "incentive stock options" under Section 422
of the Internal Revenue Code. Upon completion of the merger, each right to
receive shares of Household common stock, including Household restricted stock
rights, or benefits measured based on the value of Household common stock, will
cease to represent the right to receive shares of Household common stock or
benefits measured thereby and will be converted into, and become a right to
receive, the number of HSBC ordinary shares or benefits measured thereby
(rounded to the nearest whole HSBC ordinary share) equal to the product of the
number of shares of Household common stock subject to such Household right and
the exchange ratio. The converted HSBC stock options and other equity-based
awards will continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to them immediately prior to the completion of the merger. At or
prior to the time that the holder of a converted HSBC stock option or other
equity-based award is entitled to receive the HSBC ordinary shares underlying
such option or award, such holder will be entitled to choose whether to receive
HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

of appraisal in the merger, please refer to "Appraisal Rights."

survive the consummation of the merger.

COVENANTS RELATING TO THE CONDUCT OF HOUSEHOLD'S BUSINESS

     Subject to some exceptions, Household has agreed that except with HSBC's
prior written consent, Household will conduct its business in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice during the period from the signing of the
merger agreement until the completion of the merger. Household has also agreed
to use reasonable best efforts to preserve its present business organizations,
to keep available the services of current officers and key employees and

business. Household has also agreed that, prior to the completion of the merger,
it will not, among other things, do any of the following without the written
consent of HSBC or as disclosed to HSBC prior to executing the merger agreement:

       Household's preferred stock and the regular Household fourth quarter cash
       dividend on Household common stock, currently expected to be declared in

       event that the merger will not be completed until after the record date
       for HSBC's second interim dividend in lieu of final dividend for 2002,
       which currently is expected to be declared by HSBC in March 2003

       and paid in May 2003, Household's board of directors is entitled in its
       discretion to declare and pay additional cash dividends on the Household
       common stock, and otherwise to take appropriate steps, so that holders of
       Household common stock receive, prior to the completion of the merger,
       further dividends per share of Household common stock up to, in the
       aggregate, 2.675 times the HSBC second interim dividend per HSBC ordinary

<PAGE>

     - pay or settle any litigation, claims or obligations in excess of $1
       million, other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with
       past practice or liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
       since September 30, 2002 or contemplated by Household's most recent
       financial statements included in its SEC filings made before November 12,
       2002;

     - agree or consent to any material agreements or material modifications of
       any agreement with any governmental entity in respect of the operations
       of its business (except (1) consent decrees contemplated by the agreement
       in principle between Household and a working group of state attorneys
       general and regulatory agencies, (2) as required by law to renew company
       permits or agreements in accordance with ordinary practice or (3) to
       effect the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement).

NO SOLICITATION

     Household has agreed that it and its representatives will not:

     - solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing
       information), or take any other action designed to facilitate any
       inquiries or proposals which constitute an acquisition proposal by any
       other party;

     - participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an alternative
       transaction; or

     - enter into any agreement regarding any alternative transaction.

     However, Household and its board are not prohibited, prior to the Household
special meeting, from considering and participating in discussions and
negotiations with respect to a bona fide acquisition proposal received by
Household, if Household's board:

     - concludes in good faith (after consultation with a nationally recognized
       investment banking firm) that the acquisition proposal would, if
       accepted, be reasonably capable of being consummated and would, if
       consummated, constitute a superior proposal not solicited in violation of
       the merger agreement; and

     - determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel)
       that failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary
       duties.

     If Household does not limit the duration of these discussions and
negotiations to 20 days, HSBC has the right to terminate the merger agreement
and would be entitled to a termination fee of $550 million if Household agrees
to, or enters into, an alternative transaction within 12 months after HSBC
terminates the merger agreement. See "-- Fees and Expenses."

     An acquisition proposal is any inquiry or proposal regarding

     - any merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares
       of capital stock (including by way of a tender offer), or

     - any similar transactions involving Household or its subsidiaries that,

if consummated, would constitute an alternative transaction.

     An "alternative transaction" is:

     - any transaction through which any person other than HSBC or its
       affiliates directly or indirectly acquires or would acquire more than 25%
       of the outstanding Household common stock or voting power or of any new
       class or series of preferred stock that would be entitled to a class or a
       series vote with respect to the merger whether from Household or pursuant
       to a tender offer or otherwise;

     - any merger or other business combination involving Household (other than
       the merger with HSBC);

     - any transaction through which any person other than HSBC or its
       affiliates acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for
       this purpose equity securities of Household and equity securities of the
       entity surviving any merger or business combination including any of
       Household's subsidiaries) of

                                        81
<PAGE>

       Household or any of its subsidiaries representing more than 25% of the
       fair market value of all the assets, net revenues or net income of
       Household and its subsidiaries; or

     - any other consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or
       similar transaction other than those contemplated by the merger agreement
       as a result of which the holders of Household common stock immediately
       prior to the transaction do not, in the aggregate, own at least 75% of
       each of the outstanding common stock and the voting power of the
       surviving or resulting entity in substantially the same proportion as
       those holders held Household common stock immediately prior to the
       transaction.

     A "superior proposal" is a proposal made by a third party to acquire,
directly or indirectly (including through a merger, consolidation or similar
transaction), for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, all of the
Household common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors
or all or substantially all of the assets of Household, on terms which the
Household board reasonably believes (after consultation with a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) to be reasonably
capable of completion and, if completed, more favorable from a financial point
of view to its stockholders than the merger and the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement, taking into account at the time of determination any
changes to the financial terms of the merger agreement proposed by HSBC.

     Household has agreed

     - to notify HSBC promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) if it
       receives any acquisition proposal or any material modification to any
       acquisition proposal, or any request for nonpublic information by any
       person who has made or is considering making an acquisition proposal, and
       provide relevant information regarding the acquisition proposal or
       request;

     - to notify HSBC promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) if it enters
       into negotiations or discussions concerning any acquisition proposal; and

     - to cease any existing negotiations or discussions with any persons other
       than HSBC with respect to any acquisition proposal, and to use reasonable
       best efforts to cause all persons other than HSBC who have been furnished
       with confidential information in connection with an acquisition proposal
       to return or destroy that information.

     Except as expressly permitted by the merger agreement, neither Household's
board of directors nor any committee of Household's board of directors is
permitted to, in a manner adverse to HSBC:

     - withdraw, modify or qualify, the recommendation by the board of the
       merger, or take any action or make any statement in connection with the
       Household stockholder meeting inconsistent with its approval of the
       merger agreement; or

     - recommend any acquisition proposal other than the merger.

     However, Household's board of directors may, after three days prior notice
to HSBC, take such action to the extent that it determines in good faith (after
due consultation with outside counsel) that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.

COVENANTS RELATING TO THE CONDUCT OF HSBC'S BUSINESS

     Except as consented to by Household in writing, HSBC has agreed that, prior
to the completion of the merger, it will not, among other things, do any of the
following:

     - declare or pay dividends, other than the second interim dividend in lieu
       of final dividend for 2002 in respect of the HSBC ordinary shares, which
       is expected to be declared in March 2003 and paid in May 2003;

     - split, combine or reclassify any capital stock of HSBC;

     - acquire or agree to acquire any other corporation or other business
       organization, unless such action would not reasonably be expected to
       delay or impede the merger; or

                                        82
<PAGE>

     - amend any charter documents of HSBC or its subsidiaries in a manner that
       would materially delay or impede the merger or be adverse to holders of
       Household's capital stock, giving effect to the merger.

In addition, the HSBC board of directors is obligated, subject to its fiduciary
duties under applicable law, to recommend that HSBC's shareholders approve the
merger.

INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE

     HSBC has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to indemnify each
present and former director and officer of Household and its subsidiaries in
their capacities as such against all losses, expenses, claims, damages or
liability arising out of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the
effective time of the merger, to the fullest extent permitted under the Delaware
General Corporation Law and other applicable law and to maintain in effect
Household's current directors' and officers' liability insurance for a period of
six years, subject to specified cost limitations. For more information, please
refer to, "The Merger -- Interests of Household's Executive Officers and
Directors in the Merger -- Indemnification of Officers and Directors."

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

     HSBC has agreed that for a period of one year following the merger, with
respect to employees of the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries (so long
as they are employed by the surviving corporation or such subsidiary), it will:

     - pay such employees an annual salary or hourly wage and bonus and annual
       incentives (other than equity-based awards) that are no less than those
       payable to such employees immediately prior to the merger; and

     - provide such employees in the aggregate with employee benefits that are
       substantially similar in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided
       to such employees pursuant to Household's benefit plans (other than
       equity-based benefits) immediately prior to the merger.

     In addition, HSBC has agreed to:

     - generally recognize each employee's service with Household prior to the
       completion of the merger for purposes of eligibility to participate,
       vesting credits and, solely with respect to vacation and severance
       benefits, benefit accruals, in each case under the HSBC plans in which
       such employees are eligible to participate following the completion of
       the merger;

     - waive any exclusion for pre-existing conditions under any HSBC medical or
       health plans, provided the employee would have been entitled to coverage
       under a corresponding Household plan; and

     - honor the Household employment agreements, employment protection
       agreements and severance plans consistent with their terms and the
       accrued benefits under each of Household's non-qualified deferred
       compensation plans and retirement plans.

     However, HSBC has no obligation to continue the employment of any Household
employee for any period following the merger.

       true and correct in all but de minimis respects and in the case of other
       specified representations and warranties, true and correct in all

       a governmental entity seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of
       the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger
       agreement, seeking to impose any burdensome condition or which otherwise
       would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on HSBC or
       Household.

     In addition, the obligation of Household to effect the merger is subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions:

     - the representations and warranties of HSBC set forth in the merger
       agreement being true and correct except where the failure to be true and
       correct would not have a material adverse effect on HSBC or, in the case
       of specified representations and warranties, true and correct in all
       material respects, in each case, as of the date of the merger agreement
       and (except to the extent such representations and warranties speak as of
       an earlier date) as of the closing date, as though made on and as of the
       closing date and Household having received a certificate to that effect;

received a favorable tax opinion from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and HSBC
does not intend to waive the condition that HSBC has received a favorable tax
opinion from Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton.

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

     The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the completion
of the merger by the mutual written consent of Household and HSBC, or by either
Household or HSBC if:

     - the merger is not completed by June 30, 2003 (other than because of a
       breach of the merger agreement caused by the party seeking termination);

     - Household's stockholders fail to adopt the merger agreement at the
       Household special meeting or any adjournment thereof;

     - HSBC's shareholders fail to pass the resolution approving the merger at
       the HSBC extraordinary general meeting or any adjournment thereof;

     - a competent court or other governmental entity issues a non-appealable
       final order permanently restraining the merger; or

     - a governmental entity which must grant a regulatory approval as a
       condition to the merger denies approval of the merger (or, in the case
       HSBC, if such approval is subject to a burdensome condition) and such
       action has become final and non-appealable.

     The merger agreement may also be terminated by HSBC if:

     - there has been a breach of any of Household's representations,
       warranties, covenants or agreements, the breach has not been cured within
       30 days following written notice of the breach or cannot by its nature be
       cured within 30 days, and the breach, if occurring on the closing date,
       would constitute the failure of a condition to closing;

     - Household has willfully and materially breached its "no solicitation"
       obligations, or Household's board has failed to recommend in the proxy
       statement the adoption of the merger agreement, changed its
       recommendation to the Household stockholders, recommended an alternative
       proposal or failed to call a meeting of Household's stockholders; or

     - Household or any of its representatives has engaged in discussions with
       any person in connection with an acquisition proposal and not ceased all
       discussions within 20 days of the first date of any such discussions.

     The merger agreement may also be terminated by Household if:

     - there has been a breach of any of HSBC's representations, warranties,
       covenants or agreements set forth in the merger agreement, and the breach
       has not been cured within 30 days following written notice of the breach
       or cannot by its nature be cured within 30 days, and the breach, if
       occurring on the closing date, would constitute the failure of a
       condition to closing; or

     - HSBC's board has failed to recommend the merger to HSBC's ordinary
       shareholders or failed to call a meeting of HSBC's ordinary shareholders.

EFFECT OF TERMINATION

     In the event the merger agreement is terminated as described above, the
merger agreement will become void and neither HSBC nor Household will have any
liability pursuant to the merger agreement, except that:

     - Both HSBC and Household will remain liable for any willful breach of, or
       willful misrepresentation in, the merger agreement; and

                                        85
<PAGE>

     - Household may be required to pay HSBC a termination fee under the
       circumstances described below in "-- Fees and Expenses."

FEES AND EXPENSES

     Household has agreed to pay to HSBC a termination fee of $550 million if
any of the following occurs:

     - either party terminates the agreement because the merger was not
       completed by June 30, 2003 without the Household special meeting and vote
       on the merger having occurred, if

      - any alternative transaction was made known to Household or its
        stockholders, and was not withdrawn at least 15 days prior to, June 30,
        2003, and

      - an alternative transaction is consummated or an agreement with respect
        to any alternative transaction is entered into within 12 months after
        the date of termination;

     - either party terminates the agreement because Household's stockholders
       failed to adopt the merger agreement at the Household special meeting or
       any adjournment thereof, if

      - an acquisition proposal was made known to Household or its stockholders
        prior to the taking of the vote, and

      - any alternative transaction is consummated or an agreement with respect
        to any alternative transaction is entered into within 12 months after
        the date of termination;

     - HSBC terminates the agreement as a result of Household's breaching any of
       its covenants or agreements in the merger agreement in such a manner that
       HSBC would be entitled not to complete the merger, if

      - an acquisition proposal was made known to Household or its stockholders
        prior to the occurrence of the breach, and

      - any alternative transaction is consummated or an agreement with respect
        to any alternative transaction is entered into within 12 months after
        the date of termination;

     - HSBC terminates the agreement because Household has willfully and
       materially breached its "no solicitation" obligations, or Household's
       board has failed to recommend in the proxy statement the adoption of the
       merger agreement, changed its recommendation to the Household
       stockholders or recommended an alternative proposal or failed to call a
       meeting of Household's stockholders; or

     - HSBC terminates the agreement because Household or its representatives
       have had discussions with any person in connection with an acquisition
       proposal, Household and its representatives have not ceased those
       discussions within 20 days and Household consummates or enters into an
       agreement with respect to any alternative transaction within 12 months
       after the date of termination.

     In any situation described above, where more than one event is a condition
to the payment of the termination fee (for example, the termination of the
merger agreement and consummating or entering into an agreement relating to an
alternative transaction), the fee is not payable until the later of the events
has occurred. Except as described above, each party is obligated to pay its own
expenses in connection with the merger.

                                APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Holders of Household common stock and voting preferred stock are not
entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger. Delaware law
entitles record holders of shares of Household non-voting preferred stock,
consisting of Household's 7 5/8% cumulative preferred stock, 7.50% cumulative
preferred stock, 7.60% cumulative preferred stock and 8 1/4% cumulative
preferred stock who follow the procedures specified in Section 262 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law to have these shares appraised by the Delaware
Court of Chancery and to receive the "fair value" of these shares as determined
by the court in lieu of the merger consideration.

     Computershare Trust Company of New York, as depositary, is the holder of
record of the shares of Household non-voting preferred stock. As a holder of
depositary shares each representing an ownership of 1/40th of a share of a class
of Household non-voting preferred stock, you must exercise and perfect your
appraisal rights by acting through the depositary. If you wish to exercise and
perfect your appraisal rights, you should send a written notice to the
depositary at the following address, instructing it to take the necessary
actions summarized in this section in respect of your proportional ownership in
the shares the depositary holds of record:

                    Computershare Trust Company of New York
                             2 North LaSalle Street
                            Chicago, Illinois 60602
                            Attention: Edward Gurgul

     IN ORDER TO EXERCISE SUCH RIGHTS, A HOLDER OF HOUSEHOLD NON-VOTING
PREFERRED STOCK MUST DEMAND AND PERFECT THE RIGHTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION
262.

     The following is intended as a brief summary of the material provisions of
the Delaware statutory procedures required to be followed in order to dissent
from the merger and perfect appraisal rights. This summary, however, is not a
complete statement of all applicable requirements and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law,
the full text of which appears in Annex D of this document.

     Section 262 requires that stockholders be notified that appraisal rights
will be available not less than 20 days before the special meeting to vote on
the merger. A copy of Section 262 must be included with such notice. This
document constitutes Household's notice to the holders of the Household
non-voting preferred stock of the availability of appraisal rights in connection
with the merger in compliance with the requirements of Section 262. If you are a
holder of Household non-voting preferred stock and wish to consider exercising
your appraisal rights, you should carefully review the text of Section 262
contained in Annex D since failure timely and properly to comply with the
requirements of Section 262 will result in the loss of your appraisal rights
under Delaware law.

     Holders of Household non-voting preferred stock who elect to demand
appraisal of their shares must:

     - deliver to Household a written demand for appraisal of the shares before
       the vote with respect to the merger is taken; and

     - continuously hold such shares of record through the completion of the
       merger.

     If a holder of Household non-voting preferred stock fails to comply with
these conditions and the merger is completed, such holder will be entitled to
receive the cash payment for the shares as provided for in the merger agreement,
but such holder will have no appraisal rights with respect to the shares.

     ALL DEMANDS FOR APPRAISAL SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY OF HOUSEHOLD
AT HOUSEHOLD INTERNATIONAL, INC., 2700 SANDERS ROAD, PROSPECT HEIGHTS, ILLINOIS
60070, AND MUST BE DELIVERED BEFORE THE VOTE ON THE MERGER IS TAKEN AT THE
SPECIAL MEETING. ALL DEMANDS FOR APPRAISAL MUST BE EXECUTED BY, OR ON BEHALF OF,
THE RECORD HOLDER OF THE SHARES FOR WHICH APPRAISAL RIGHTS ARE BEING EXERCISED.
THE DEMAND MUST REASONABLY INFORM HOUSEHOLD OF THE IDENTITY OF THE HOLDER AND
THE INTENTION OF THE HOLDER TO DEMAND APPRAISAL OF HIS, HER OR ITS SHARES.

                                        87
<PAGE>

     Within 10 days after the effective date of the merger, HSBC must give
written notice that the merger has become effective to each holder who has
properly filed a written demand for appraisal. At any time within 60 days after
the effective date, any holder who has demanded appraisal has the right to
withdraw the demand and to accept the cash payment specified by the merger
agreement for his or her shares. Within 120 days after the effective date,
either HSBC or any holder who has complied with the requirements of Section 262
may file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination
of the fair value of the shares held by all holders entitled to appraisal. HSBC
has no obligation or intention to file such a petition in the event there are
dissenting stockholders. Accordingly, the failure of a holder to file such a
petition within the period specified could nullify the holder's previously
written demand for appraisal.

     If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a holder and a copy of the
petition is delivered to HSBC, HSBC will then be obligated, within 20 days after
receiving service of a copy of the petition, to provide the Chancery Court with
a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all holders who have
demanded an appraisal of their shares. After notice to dissenting holders, the
Chancery Court is empowered to conduct a hearing upon the petition, and to
determine those holders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become
entitled to the appraisal rights provided thereby. The Chancery Court may
require the holders who have demanded payment for their shares to submit their
stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the
pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply
with that direction, the Chancery Court may dismiss the proceedings as to that
holder.

     After determination of the holders entitled to appraisal of their shares,
the Chancery Court will appraise the shares, determining their fair value
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation
of the merger, together with a fair rate of interest. When the value is
determined, the Chancery Court will direct the payment of such value, with
interest thereon accrued during the pendency of the proceeding, if the Chancery
Court so determines, to the holders entitled to receive the same, upon surrender
by such holders of the certificates representing those shares.

     In determining fair value, the Chancery Court is required to take into
account all relevant factors. A holder of Household non-voting preferred stock
should be aware that the fair value of such holder's shares as determined under
Section 262 could be more, the same, or less than the value that such holder is
entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement.

     Costs of the appraisal proceeding may be imposed upon HSBC and the holders
participating in the appraisal proceeding by the Chancery Court as the Chancery
Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon the application of a holder,
the Chancery Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any
holder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to
be charged pro rata against the value of all shares entitled to appraisal. Any
holder who had demanded appraisal rights will not, after the effective date, be
entitled to vote shares subject to that demand for any purpose or to receive
payments of dividends or any other distribution with respect to those shares,
other than with respect to payment as of a record date prior to the effective
date. If no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective
date of the merger, or if the holder delivers a written withdrawal of his or her
demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the merger within 60 days after the
effective date of the merger, then the right of that holder to appraisal will
cease and that holder will be entitled to receive the cash payment for shares of
his, her or its shares pursuant to the merger agreement. Any withdrawal of a
demand for appraisal made more than 60 days after the effective date of the
merger may only be made with the written approval of the surviving corporation.
However, no appraisal proceeding in the Chancery Court may be dismissed as to
any stockholder without the approval of the court.

     IN VIEW OF THE COMPLEXITY OF SECTION 262, HOLDERS OF HOUSEHOLD NON-VOTING
PREFERRED STOCK THAT MAY WISH TO DISSENT FROM THE MERGER AND PURSUE APPRAISAL
RIGHTS SHOULD PROMPTLY CONSULT THEIR LEGAL ADVISORS.

    and H.K.$10 ordinary shares and the issue in substitution therefor of three
    ordinary shares of U.S.$0.50 par value for each ordinary share. The
    dividends per share for 1997 and 1998 have been restated accordingly.

    election, paid in either sterling or Hong Kong dollars, or satisfied by the
    issue of new shares in lieu of a cash dividend. In the table above sterling
    dividends have been translated into U.S. dollars at the noon buying rates

subsidiaries (including Beneficial Corporation, which was acquired in 1998),
offers real estate secured loans, auto finance loans, MasterCard and VISA credit
cards, private label credit cards, tax refund anticipation loans, retail
installment sales financing loans and other types of unsecured loans, as well as
credit and specialty insurance products. At September 30, 2002, Household had
approximately 32,000 employees and over 50 million active consumer accounts.

     As a non-operating holding company, Household's primary source of funds is
cash received from its subsidiaries, principally in the form of dividends.
Dividend distributions to Household from its banking and insurance subsidiaries
may be restricted by foreign, federal and state laws and regulations. Dividend
distributions from foreign subsidiaries may also be restricted by exchange
controls of the country in which the subsidiary is located. Also, as a holding
company, the rights of any of Household's creditors or stockholders to
participate in the assets of any subsidiary upon its liquidation or
recapitalization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's
creditors, except in cases where Household is a creditor with recognized claims
against the subsidiary. Nevertheless, there are no restrictions that currently
materially limit Household's ability to make payments to its creditors or to pay
dividends on its preferred stock or common stock at current levels. Also, there
are no restrictions which Household reasonably believes are likely to materially
limit future payments to its creditors or dividends.

and financial condition in the documents described under "Where You Can Find
More Information."

                               HSBC AND HOUSEHOLD
          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

INTRODUCTION

     HSBC has reached an agreement to acquire Household in accordance with the
terms of a merger agreement entered into on November 14, 2002 between HSBC, H2
(a wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC) and Household. Under the terms of the merger
agreement, Household will be merged with and into H2. Following the acquisition,
H2 will remain a wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC but will be renamed Household
International, Inc.

     Holders of Household common stock will be entitled to receive, at their
election for each share of Household common stock, 2.675 HSBC ordinary shares or
0.535 HSBC ADSs, each HSBC ADS representing 5 HSBC ordinary shares. All the
outstanding Household non-voting preferred stock will be converted into a right
to receive from HSBC cash in the aggregate amount of approximately U.S.$1,100
million, together with accrued but unpaid dividends. In addition, all the
outstanding Household voting preferred stock will be designated for redemption
effective prior to the merger and Household will deposit the applicable
redemption price in trust for the holders of these shares under the terms of the
instruments governing their shares.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     HSBC and Household are providing the following unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial information and explanatory notes, which we refer
to as the pro forma financial information, to illustrate the impact of the
merger on the companies' historical financial positions and results of
operations under the acquisition method of accounting.

     The pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2001
and as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2002 is presented on a U.K. GAAP
basis and combines the following:

     - HSBC's historical financial information for the year ended December 31,
       2001 (as restated following implementation of U.K. Financial Reporting
       Standard (FRS) 19 "Deferred Tax") and as of and for the six months ended
       June 30, 2002.

     - Household's historical financial information on a U.S. GAAP basis for the
       year ended December 31, 2001 and as of and for the six months ended June
       30, 2002, adjusted to conform with HSBC's accounting policies under U.K.
       GAAP.

     - Adjustments to give effect to capital security transactions of Household
       subsequent to June 30, 2002.

     - Pro forma adjustments related to acquisition accounting utilizing the
       respective fair values of Household's assets and liabilities as of June
       30, 2002.

     The unaudited pro forma consolidated combined balance sheet as of June 30,
2002 assumes the merger was consummated on that date. The unaudited pro forma
condensed combined statements of income for the six months ended June 30, 2002
and for the year ended December 31, 2001 give effect to the merger as if the
merger had been consummated on January 1, 2001, the first day of the earliest
financial period presented.

     The pro forma financial information is based on, and derived from, and
should be read in conjunction with, the historical consolidated financial
statements and related notes of HSBC and Household, incorporated by reference in
this document. Please refer to "Where You Can Find More Information".

     The pro forma financial information is presented for illustrative purposes
only and is not necessarily indicative of what the operating results or the
financial position of the combined company would have been had the merger
occurred on the respective dates assumed and is not necessarily indicative of
future operating results or financial position of the combined company.

ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING

     HSBC intends to account for the merger using acquisition accounting under
U.K. GAAP. Under this method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of
Household will be recorded, as of the completion date of the merger, at their
respective fair values and added to those of HSBC. Financial statements and
reported results of operations of HSBC issued after consummation of the merger
will reflect these values, but prior HSBC financial statements will not be
restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results
of operations of Household.

     All pro forma financial information contained in this document has been
prepared using the acquisition method to account for the merger. Under U.K.
GAAP, the final determination of the purchase price is based on the price of
HSBC ordinary shares as of the date the merger is completed. In addition, the
final allocation of the purchase price will be determined after completion of a
thorough analysis to determine the fair values of Household's assets and
liabilities. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting adjustments and
goodwill may be materially different from those reflected in the pro forma
information presented in this document.

                               HSBC AND HOUSEHOLD
     NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

NOTE 1 -- BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     The pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2001
and as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2002 is presented on a U.K. GAAP
basis and combines the following:

     - HSBC's historical financial information for the year ended December 31,
       2001 (as restated following implementation of U.K. Financial Reporting
       Standard (FRS) 19 "Deferred Tax") and as of and for the six months ended
       June 30, 2002.

     - Household's historical financial information on a U.S. GAAP basis for the
       year ended December 31, 2001 and as of and for the six months ended June
       30, 2002, adjusted to conform with HSBC's accounting policies under U.K.
       GAAP as described in Notes 4 and 5.

     - Adjustments to give effect to capital security transactions of Household
       subsequent to June 30, 2002 as described in Note 2.

     - Pro forma adjustments related to acquisition accounting utilizing the
       respective fair values of Household's assets and liabilities as of June
       30, 2002 as described in Notes 3 and 6.

     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30,
2002 assumes the merger was consummated on that date. The unaudited pro forma
condensed combined statements of income for the six months ended June 30, 2002
and for the year ended December 31, 2001 give effect to the merger as if the
merger had been consummated on January 1, 2001, the first day of the earliest
financial period presented.

     The pro forma financial information includes estimated costs and
adjustments to record assets and liabilities of Household at their respective
fair values. The pro forma costs and adjustments represent HSBC management's
best estimate based on available information at this time. They are subject to
updates as variables change, additional information becomes available and
additional analyses are performed. For the purpose of the pro forma financial
information, the purchase price has been based on the closing mid-market price
of an HSBC ordinary share on the London Stock Exchange on November 13, 2002, the
last day prior to the public announcement of the signing of the merger
agreement. Under U.K. GAAP, the final determination of the purchase price is
based upon the price of HSBC ordinary shares as of the date the merger is
completed. In addition, the final allocation of the purchase price will be
determined after completion of a thorough analysis to determine the fair values
of Household's assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the final acquisition
accounting adjustments and goodwill may be materially different from those
reflected in the pro forma financial information presented herein.

     Additionally, changes to Household's shareholders' funds including net
income from July 1, 2002 through to the date the merger is completed will also
affect the amount of goodwill recorded as the pro forma financial information
does not include net income for any period subsequent to June 30, 2002 nor does
it reflect two significant items announced subsequent to June 30, 2002. These
items comprise:

          (i) the $525 million pre-tax charge recorded by Household in the third
     quarter of 2002 related to Household's agreement in principle with a
     multi-state working group of state attorneys general and regulatory
     agencies to effect a nationwide resolution of alleged violations of federal
     and state consumer protection, consumer finance and banking laws and
     regulations related to real estate secured lending from its retail branch
     consumer lending operations as operated under the HFC and Beneficial brand
     names; and

          (ii) the impact of Household's announcement on October 11, 2002 that
     it had determined that the continued operation of Household Bank, f.s.b.
     was not in Household's long-term strategic interest. During the fourth
     quarter of 2002, Household completed the sale of substantially all of the
     remaining assets and deposits of Household Bank, f.s.b. A loss of $240
     million (after tax) was recorded on the disposition of these assets and
     deposits. However, the fair value of Household Bank, f.s.b.'s assets and
     liabilities as of June 30, 2002 is reflected in the acquisition accounting
     adjustments in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as
     of June 30, 2002.

                               HSBC AND HOUSEHOLD
           NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL
                           INFORMATION -- (CONTINUED)

     HSBC and Household entered into the merger agreement with the expectation
that the merger would result in significant funding benefits, cost and revenue
synergies and cost savings in the areas of information technology,
administrative support and consolidating of card processing. The pro forma
financial information does not include any impact of the expected benefits and
synergies and there can be no assurance that the combined group will realize
these anticipated benefits in full or at all.

     The pro forma financial information is presented for illustrative purposes
only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have
occurred or financial position if the merger had been consummated during the
period or as of the date for which the pro forma financial information is
presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating results or the
financial position of the combined group.

NOTE 2 -- SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS

     The pro forma financial information includes adjustments for capital
security transactions occurring subsequent to June 30, 2002 that impact the
purchase price. The following table reconciles common stock outstanding and
shareholders' funds derived from Household's unaudited historical financial
statements to the amounts included in the pro forma financial information prior
to the acquisition accounting adjustments.

     - Value of HSBC ordinary shares to be issued in exchange for 473,268,450
       shares of Household common stock (as explained in Note 2) based on the
       closing mid-market price of an HSBC ordinary share on the London Stock
       Exchange on November 13, 2002, the last day prior to the public
       announcement of

       the signing of the merger agreement, and the exchange ratio of 2.675 HSBC
       ordinary shares for each share of Household common stock.

     - Fair value as of June 30, 2002 of options outstanding at that date to
       purchase shares of Household common stock granted to Household employees
       and directors under Household's option plans. When HSBC and Household
       complete the merger, all Household options will vest (except for options
       granted in November 2002) and will be assumed by HSBC and become options
       to purchase HSBC ordinary shares. The number of shares subject to these
       options and the exercise price of the options will be adjusted to reflect
       the exchange ratio.

     - Fair value of the conversion obligations of the 8.875% Adjustable
       Conversion-Rate Equity Security Units issued in October 2002. When HSBC
       and Household complete the merger, the obligation of the holders of
       Adjustable Conversion-Rate Equity Security Units to purchase shares of
       Household common stock will become obligations to purchase HSBC ordinary
       shares. The number of shares subject to these obligations and price at
       which they are to be issued will be adjusted to reflect the exchange
       ratio.

     - Cash consideration to be paid by HSBC to the holders of Household
       non-voting preferred stock.

     - Acquisition costs to be paid by HSBC estimated at $265 million. Of this
       amount, $213 million relates to U.K. stamp duty or stamp duty reserve
       tax, the calculation of which assumes all holders of Household common
       stock elect to receive HSBC ADSs rather than HSBC ordinary shares.

     No account has been taken in the determination of the purchase price for
the purpose of the pro forma financial information of the value of the HSBC 2002
second interim dividend to which economic benefit the holders of Household
common stock are entitled under the merger agreement. HSBC expects to declare
the amount of the 2002 second interim dividend in March 2003 and pay it in May
2003.

     In allocating the purchase price to the tangible assets and liabilities of
Household, adjustments have been made to:

     - eliminate Household's existing goodwill and intangibles under U.K. GAAP
       as of June 30, 2002, which relate primarily to the acquisition of
       Beneficial in 1998 (see Note 5); and

     - reflect the respective fair values of the tangible assets and liabilities
       of Household as at June 30, 2002.

     The fair value adjustments relate primarily to the valuation of Household's
financial assets and liabilities (including derivatives) considering market
rates as of June 30, 2002. The fair value adjustments also include amounts
relating to change in control payments and the provision for bad and doubtful
debts as follows:

     - Of the amount payable under 10 employment agreements which will come into
       effect on the completion of the merger, HSBC has estimated that an amount
       of approximately $45 million would have been payable under employment
       arrangements existing prior to November 13, 2002 and this amount has been
       included as a fair value adjustment. HSBC intends to record a charge, in
       addition, of $55 million in connection with such agreements immediately
       after completion of the merger.

     - HSBC's policies on loan loss provisioning on consumer assets are in
       principle the same as those of Household, seeking to maintain, on a
       prudent and consistent basis, amounts sufficient to cover probable losses
       of principal, interest and fees based on analyses of trends in
       contractual delinquency and historical loss experience. HSBC intends,
       following the merger and subject to receipt of regulatory and other
       approvals, to hold Household's private label credit card receivables
       within HSBC's U.S. banking subsidiary. As a result, HSBC anticipates
       regulatory accounting charge-off guidelines issued by the Federal
       Financial Institutions Examination Council, or FFIEC, will need to be
       applied to these receivables following completion of the merger.
       Implementation of such guidelines will result in private label credit
       card receivables being charged-off at 6 months contractually delinquent
       versus the current

       Household practice of being charged-off at 9 months contractually
       delinquent. HSBC's plans for ultimate collection on these receivables
       will therefore be demonstrably different from those of Household due to
       the shorter charge-off period. As a result, the fair value adjustments
       include an adjustment to the provision for bad and doubtful debts for
       these private label credit card receivables of approximately $200 million
       to reflect the expected impact of the implementation of the FFIEC
       guidelines.

     The initial computation of the purchase price, the allocation of the
purchase price to the net tangible assets of Household based on fair values
estimated at June 30, 2002, and the resulting amount of goodwill under U.K. GAAP
are presented below.

NOTE 4 -- RECLASSIFICATIONS TO CONFORM HOUSEHOLD HISTORICAL FINANCIAL
          INFORMATION TO HSBC PRESENTATION UNDER U.K. GAAP

     Reclassifications have been made to the Household historical financial
information presented under U.S. GAAP to conform to HSBC's presentation under
U.K. GAAP. None of these reclassification adjustments has an impact on net
income or common shareholders' equity.

NOTE 5 -- U.K. GAAP ADJUSTMENTS TO HISTORICAL HOUSEHOLD STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND
          BALANCE SHEET

     Household prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. For purposes of preparing the pro forma financial information,
Household's historical consolidated financial statements have

                                       105
<PAGE>
                               HSBC AND HOUSEHOLD
           NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL
                           INFORMATION -- (CONTINUED)

been adjusted to conform with HSBC's accounting policies under U.K. GAAP by
giving effect to the adjustments described below.

  a.  Deferred Origination Expenses

     Under U.S. GAAP, certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and
recognized over the life of the related loans as a reduction in the loans'
yield. Under U.K. GAAP, HSBC applies a more restricted definition of the
directly incurred origination expenses which are deferred and subsequently
amortized over the life of the loans and classified as operating expenses. The
impact of aligning with HSBC's accounting policies is to reduce the amount of
origination costs deferred on the balance sheet, to reduce correspondingly the
amortization cost from deferred origination costs, and to increase operating
expenses.

  b.  Derivative Financial Instruments

     Under U.S. GAAP, all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at
their fair value. Derivatives are designated either as a fair value hedge, a
cash flow hedge, a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation or a
non-hedging derivative. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as
fair value hedges, along with the change in fair value of the hedged asset or
liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current
period earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash
flow hedges, to the extent effective as a hedge, are recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the period during
which the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
used to hedge net investment in foreign operations, to the extent effective as a
hedge, are recorded in common shareholders' equity as a component of the
cumulative translation adjustment account within accumulated other comprehensive
income. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as
hedging instruments and ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of
hedging instruments are recognized in earnings in the period of change in fair
value.

     Under U.K. GAAP, non-trading derivatives, including qualifying interest
rate swaps, are accounted for on an equivalent basis to the underlying assets,
liabilities or net positions. Any profit or loss arising is recognized on the
same basis as that arising from the related assets, liabilities or positions.

     For purposes of the presentation of Household's U.K. GAAP financial
information, all adjustments to measure non-trading derivatives at fair value
have been reversed.

  c.  Receivables Sold and Serviced with Limited Recourse and Securitization
Revenue

     Some receivables have been securitized and sold to investors with limited
recourse with servicing rights retained by Household. Under U.S. GAAP, the
receivables are removed from the balance sheet and a gain on sale is recognized
for the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the sales
proceeds. The resulting gain is adjusted by a provision for estimated probable
losses under the recourse provisions based on historical experience and
estimates of expected future performance.

     In connection with these transactions, an interest-only strip receivable,
representing the contractual right to receive interest and other cash flows from
Household's securitization trusts, is recorded. The interest-only strip
receivables are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded
as adjustments to common shareholders' funds in accumulated other comprehensive
income, net of income taxes.

     Under U.K. GAAP, the Household securitizations are treated as financing
transactions. The securitized receivables are treated as owned by Household and
consequently are included on Household's balance sheet. Any gains recorded under
U.S. GAAP on these transactions and fair value adjustments to the interest-only
strip receivables are reversed. For certain securitization transactions, the
receivables and associated debt are reported under U.K. GAAP under a "linked
presentation" format where the debt is non-recourse and is repayable only from
benefits generated by the assets being financed or by transfer of the assets
themselves. In

                                       106

                               HSBC AND HOUSEHOLD
           NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL
                           INFORMATION -- (CONTINUED)

a linked presentation, the non-recourse debt is shown deducted from the related
gross receivables on the face of the balance sheet.

  d.  Forward Purchase Agreements

     Under U.S. GAAP, the agreements Household has entered into to purchase, on
a forward basis, shares of its common stock have been treated as equity
instruments. Under U.K. GAAP, the fair value of such agreements has been
recorded as a liability and deducted from shareholders' funds.

  e.  Investment Securities

     Under U.S. GAAP, available-for-sale securities are measured at fair value
with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported net of
applicable taxes within accumulated other comprehensive income.

     Under U.K. GAAP, debt securities and equity shares intended to be held on a
continuing basis are disclosed as investment securities and are included in the
balance sheet at cost less provision for any permanent diminution in value.

     All of Household's available-for-sale securities are classified under U.K.
GAAP as investment securities. Accordingly, in the pro forma presentation, all
such securities have been recorded at cost and the equity adjustment for
unrealized gains and losses has been reversed.

  f.  Goodwill

     Under U.S. GAAP, amortization of goodwill recorded in past business
combinations ceased on January 1, 2002. Prior to that time, goodwill was
amortized over its estimated useful life. Under U.K. GAAP, for acquisitions
prior to 1998, goodwill was charged against reserves in the year of acquisition.
For acquisitions made since January 1, 1998, goodwill is included in the balance
sheet and amortized over its useful economic life on a straight-line basis.

     In the pro forma presentation, for acquisitions prior to 1998, goodwill
arising has been eliminated in other reserves and related goodwill amortization
prior to 2002 has been reversed. For post-1998 acquisitions, amortization has
been included in the December 31, 2001 and June 30, 2002 income statements.

  g.  Household's Merger with Beneficial Corporation

     On June 30, 1998, Household merged with Beneficial Corporation, or
Beneficial, a consumer finance company headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware.
Each outstanding share of Beneficial common stock was converted into 3.066
shares of Household's common stock, resulting in the issuance of approximately
168.4 million shares of Household common stock to the former Beneficial
stockholders. In addition, each share of Beneficial's convertible preferred
stock was converted into Household common stock and each share of Beneficial's
other preferred stock was converted into newly created Household preferred stock
with terms substantially similar to those of the previously existing Beneficial
preferred stock. Under U.S. GAAP, the merger was accounted for as a pooling of
interests, and, as such, the consolidated financial statements of Household
include the financial position, results of operations and changes in cash flows
of Beneficial for all periods presented.

     Under U.K. GAAP, the merger of Household and Beneficial has been accounted
for using acquisition accounting and, as such, the assets and liabilities of
Beneficial at June 30, 1998 would have been recorded at their respective fair
values and added to the assets and liabilities of Household. Such fair value
adjustments would not have been significant. The excess of the purchase price
over the net tangible assets of Beneficial has been recorded as goodwill and
reflected in the Household U.K. GAAP balance sheet at June 30, 2002. The

                                       107

                               HSBC AND HOUSEHOLD
           NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL
                           INFORMATION -- (CONTINUED)

amortization of this goodwill over a 20-year estimated life has been reflected
in the Household U.K. GAAP income statements for the year ended December 31,
2001 and for the six months ended June 30, 2002.

  h.  Costs of Software for Internal Use

     Under U.S. GAAP, costs incurred in the application development stage of the
development of software are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful
life of the software. Under U.K. GAAP, HSBC generally expenses costs of software
developed for internal use. In the pro forma presentation, any software costs
capitalized under U.S. GAAP have been expensed in the period incurred and the
resulting amortization has been eliminated.

  i.  Interest Suspension

     Household and HSBC suspend interest income on real estate secured, personal
non-credit card and commercial loans when principal or interest payments are
more than three months contractually past due. However, HSBC also reverses any
interest income previously recognized in the period. In the pro forma
presentation, all accrued interest on the above products more than three months
contractually past due has been reversed together with any loss reserves
allocated to that accrued interest.

  j.  Income Taxes

     Where appropriate, the adjustments from U.S. GAAP to U.K. GAAP on the
statements of income of Household have been tax effected assuming an effective
tax rate of 36.5%.

     Under U.S. GAAP, tax credits on share compensation expense are not recorded
in arriving at net income, but instead are recorded as part of shareholders'
equity. Under U.K. GAAP, such credits form part of the profit for the year.

     Adjustments made to the statement of income under each item described above
to conform Household's U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statements with HSBC's
accounting policies under U.K. GAAP are as follows:

     The unaudited pro forma income statements for the six months ended June 30,
2002 and for the year ended December 31, 2001 include amortization of the
goodwill and fair value adjustments determined as of June 30, 2002. HSBC
proposes to amortize the goodwill arising on the merger over a period of 20
years. Under U.K. GAAP, the fair value adjustments to tangible assets and
liabilities are amortized over the remaining lives of the relevant assets and
liabilities.

     In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statements
for the six months ended June 30, 2002 and for the year ended December 31, 2001
are adjusted to:

     - exclude the amortization of Household's existing goodwill and intangible
       assets under U.K. GAAP including goodwill relating to Beneficial as
       described in Note 5; and

     - exclude the dividends payable on the preferred stock of Household which
       is redeemable on completion of the merger and reduce pro forma interest
       income on the cash consideration payable by Household and HSBC on such
       redemption.

NOTE 7 -- SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN U.K. GAAP AND U.S. GAAP

     The pro forma financial information has been prepared in accordance with
U.K. GAAP, which differs in certain significant respects from U.S. GAAP.

     A detailed explanation of the significant differences relating to HSBC and
the reconciliation of HSBC's net income and shareholders' equity between U.K.
GAAP and U.S. GAAP are contained in HSBC's annual report on Form 20-F/A for the
year ended December 31, 2001 and report on Form 6-K, dated August 5, 2002,
containing interim financial information for the six months ended June 30, 2002,
incorporated herein by reference. A detailed explanation of the significant
differences relating to the reconciliation of Household's net income and
shareholders' equity between U.K. GAAP and U.S. GAAP is set forth in Note 5.

     The explanations of all these differences are summarized following the
tables below.

     The following summarizes the reasons for the significant differences
between U.K. GAAP and U.S. GAAP as applicable to the net income and shareholders
equity of the enlarged HSBC Group in the Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial
Information.

(a) Lease financing

     Under U.K. GAAP, finance lease income is recognized so as to give a
constant rate of return on the net cash investment in the lease, taking into
account tax payments and receipts associated with the lease.

     Under U.S. GAAP, unearned income on finance leases is taken to income at a
rate calculated to give a constant rate of return on the investment in the
lease, but no account is taken of the tax flows generated by the lease.

(b) Debt swaps

     Under U.K. GAAP, assets acquired in exchange for other advances in order to
achieve an orderly realization are reported as advances. The assets acquired are
recorded at the carrying value of the advances

           NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL
                           INFORMATION -- (CONTINUED)

disposed of at the date of the exchange, with any provision having been duly
updated. Any subsequent deterioration in their value will be recorded as an
additional provision.

     Under U.S. GAAP, debt securities and equity shares acquired in exchange for
advances in order to achieve an orderly realization are required to be accounted
at their fair value, usually their secondary market value, at the date of
exchange. Certain of these debt swaps qualify as securities and accordingly are
classified as available-for-sale.

(c) Shareholders' interest in long-term assurance fund

     Under U.K. GAAP, the shareholders' interest in the in-force life assurance
and fund policies of the long-term assurance funds are valued at the net present
value of the profits inherent in such policies. This value includes a prudent
valuation of the discounted future earnings expected to emerge from business
currently in force, taking into account factors such as recent experience and
general economic conditions, together with the surplus retained in the long-term
assurance funds. These are determined annually in consultation with independent
actuaries and are included in "Other assets".

     Under U.S. GAAP, the net present value of these profits is not recognized.
An adjustment is made to amortize acquisition costs and fees in accordance with
SFAS 97 "Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain
Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of
Investments".

(d) Pension costs

     Under U.K. GAAP, pension costs, based on actuarial assumptions and methods,
are charged so as to allocate the cost of providing benefits over the average
remaining service lives of employees.

     U.S. GAAP prescribes a similar method of actuarial valuation but requires
assets to be assessed at fair value and the assessment of liabilities to be
based on current settlement rates. Certain variations from regular cost are
allocated in equal amounts over the average remaining service lives of current
employees.

(e) Stock-based compensation

     In HSBC, executive share options are granted at fair value, and employees
are granted shares at a 20 per cent discount to the fair value at the date of
grant under HSBC's Save-As-You-Earn schemes. In neither case, under U.K. GAAP,
are compensation costs recognized for such awards. For longer term and other
restricted share award schemes, the fair value of the shares awarded is charged
to compensation cost over the period in respect of which performance conditions
apply. To the extent the award is adjusted by virtue of performance conditions
being met or not, the compensation cost is adjusted in line with this.

     Under U.S. GAAP, SFAS 123 "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" encourages a
fair value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation plans which
has been adopted. Under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at
date of grant based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service
period, which is usually the vesting period.

(f) Goodwill

     Under U.K. GAAP, for acquisitions prior to 1998, goodwill arising on the
acquisition of subsidiary undertakings, associates or joint ventures was charged
against reserves in the year of acquisition.

     In 1998, HSBC adopted FRS 10. For acquisitions made on or after January 1,
1998, goodwill is included in the balance sheet on a straight-line basis. FRS 10
allows goodwill previously eliminated against reserves to be reinstated, but
does not require it. In common with many other U.K. companies, HSBC elected not
to reinstate such goodwill. HSBC considered whether reinstatement would
materially assist the understanding of readers of its accounts who were already
familiar with U.K. GAAP and decided that it would not.

                                       116

                               HSBC AND HOUSEHOLD
           NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL
                           INFORMATION -- (CONTINUED)

     Goodwill included in the balance sheet is tested for impairment when
necessary by comparing the recoverable amount of an entity with the carrying
value of its net assets, including attributable goodwill. The recoverable amount
of an entity is the higher of its value in use, generally the present value of
the expected cash flows from the entity, and its net realizable value.

     At the date of disposal of subsidiary undertakings, associates or joint
ventures, any unamortized goodwill or goodwill charged directly against
reserves, is included in HSBC's share of total net assets of the undertaking in
the calculation of the profit on disposal of the undertaking.

     Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill acquired up to June 30, 2001 is capitalized and
amortized over its estimated useful life but not more than 25 years. Under the
transition requirements of SFAS 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets",
goodwill acquired after June 30, 2001 is capitalized but not amortized, and is
subject to annual impairment testing as required under APB 17 "Intangible
Assets". All goodwill ceased to be amortized from December 31, 2001.

     U.S. GAAP requires the recoverability of goodwill to be assessed whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable. Impairment of goodwill relating to an entity is
recognized if the sum of the estimated future cashflows (undiscounted and
without interest charges) expected to be generated by that entity is less than
its carrying amount. If impairment is assessed to exist, the amount recognized
is the amount by which the carrying amount of the entity exceeds its fair value.

(g) Internal software costs

     Under U.K. GAAP, costs of software developed for internal use are generally
expensed as they are incurred.

     Under U.S. GAAP, costs incurred in the application development stage of
internal software must be capitalized and amortized over its estimated useful
life.

(h) Revaluation of property

     Under U.K. GAAP, HSBC values its properties on an annual basis and
adjustments arising from such revaluations are taken to reserves. HSBC
depreciates non-investment properties based on cost or the revalued amounts. No
depreciation is charged on investment properties other than leaseholds with 20
years or less to expiry.

     U.S. GAAP does not permit revaluations of property although it requires
recognition of asset impairment. Any realized surplus or deficit is therefore
reflected in income on disposal of the property. Depreciation is charged on all
properties based on cost.

(i) Acquisition accounting adjustments relating to previous acquisitions

     Under U.K. GAAP, certain costs which relate to either post-acquisition
management decisions or decisions prior to the acquisition are required to be
expensed to the profit and loss account and cannot be capitalized as goodwill,
as may be required by U.S. GAAP.

     In addition, under U.K. GAAP, the Beneficial merger, as explained in Note
5(g) to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information, would have
been accounted for using acquisition accounting whereas it was accounted for
under U.S. GAAP as a pooling of interests.

(j) Accruals accounted derivatives

     Under U.K. GAAP, internal derivatives used to hedge banking book
transactions may be accruals accounted but under U.S. GAAP, all derivatives are
held at fair value. With the exception of certain subsidiaries in North America,
HSBC has not elected to satisfy the more prescriptive documentation

                           INFORMATION -- (CONTINUED)

requirements of SFAS 133 "Accounting for Derivatives Instruments and Hedging
Instruments" in respect of derivative contracts.

(k) Available-for-sale securities

     Under U.K. GAAP, investment securities are included in the balance sheet at
cost less provision for any permanent diminution in value.

     Under U.S. GAAP, available-for-sale securities are included in the balance
sheet at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses, net of applicable
taxes, included in a separate component of shareholders' equity, where an
available-for-sale security experiences an other than temporary decline in fair
value below cost, this decline is treated as realized and included in earnings.

(l) Foreign exchange differences on available-for-sale securities

     Under U.K. GAAP, investment securities denominated in currencies other than
the functional currency of the entity concerned are included at cost less
provisions for permanent diminution translated at the year end rate. Foreign
exchange differences arising from this translation are recorded in the profit
and loss account.

     Under U.S. GAAP, those investment securities categorized as
available-for-sale are held at fair value with any valuation differences
(including those attributable to foreign exchange movements) being recorded as
"Other Comprehensive Income".

(m) Foreign exchange losses on Argentine funding

     Following pesification, HSBC Argentina's balance sheet primarily reflected
Argentine peso assets more than fully funded by Argentine peso liabilities. In
addition, HSBC Argentina had residual external U.S. dollar liabilities which
essentially represented a portion of the loss recognized in 2001. Under U.K.
GAAP, these U.S. dollar liabilities are treated as a separate operation with the
U.S. dollar as the unit of account, as they are no longer funding the ongoing
business.

     Under U.S. GAAP, this accounting treatment is not possible and the U.S.
dollar liabilities are treated as part of the Argentine operation which accounts
in Argentine pesos. As a result, as the Argentine peso has weakened, the U.S.
dollar denominated liabilities generate a substantial loss in Argentine pesos
which is reflected in U.S. GAAP income. However, as the pro forma financial
information is prepared in U.S. dollars and economically there is no change in
the amount of U.S. dollars owing an exactly offsetting gain is reflected in the
U.S. GAAP accounts in reserves.

(n) Deferred origination expenses

     This reverses the adjustment made to Household's U.S. GAAP numbers to
conform to HSBC's U.K. GAAP accounting policies. (See note 5a)

(o) Interest suspension

     This reverses the adjustment made to Household's U.S. GAAP numbers to
conform to HSBC's U.K. GAAP accounting policies. (See note 5i).

(p) Securitizations

     This reverses the adjustment made to Household's U.S. GAAP numbers to
conform to HSBC's U.K. GAAP accounting policies. (See note 5c).

(q) Taxation

     Under U.K. GAAP, deferred tax is generally provided in the accounts for all
timing differences, subject to the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

                                       118

                               HSBC AND HOUSEHOLD
           NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL
                           INFORMATION -- (CONTINUED)

     Under U.S. GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in
respect of all temporary differences. A valuation allowance is raised against
any deferred tax asset where it is more likely than not that the asset, or a
part thereof, will not be realized.

     In addition, where appropriate, the adjustments from U.K. GAAP to U.S. GAAP
on net income and shareholders' equity have been tax effected at the relevant
effective tax rate.

(r) Minority interest in reconciling items

     This reflects the appropriate share of adjustments attributable to minority
interests.

(s) Acquisition accounting adjustments relating to the merger

     The acquisition accounting adjustments under U.K. and U.S. GAAP relating to
the merger are different primarily due to the recognition under U.K. GAAP of
goodwill relating to the acquisition of Beneficial. In addition, the fair value
adjustments are different as the book values of Household's tangible assets and
liabilities are different under U.K. GAAP and U.S. GAAP.

(t) Own shares held

     U.K. GAAP allows for the inclusion of own shares held within equity shares.

     AICPA Accounting Research Bulletin 51 "Consolidated Financial Statements"
requires a reduction in shareholders' equity for own shares held.

(u) Dividend payable

     Under U.K. GAAP, dividends declared after the period end are recorded in
the period to which they relate.

     Under U.S. GAAP, dividends are recorded in the period in which they are
declared.

                      DESCRIPTION OF HSBC ORDINARY SHARES

     The following information is a summary of the material terms of the HSBC
ordinary shares of nominal value U.S.$0.50 each, as set out in HSBC's Memorandum
and Articles of Association and relevant provisions of the U.K. Companies Act
1985, as amended, which we refer to in this document as the Companies Act.
Holders of Household common stock are encouraged to read the full HSBC
Memorandum and Articles of Association which were filed as an exhibit to HSBC's
Registration Statement on Form F-3/A (no. 333-92024) and are incorporated into
this document by reference.

GENERAL

     The authorized share capital of HSBC consists of 15,000,000,000 ordinary
shares of nominal value U.S.$0.50 each, 301,500 non-voting deferred shares of
nominal value L1 each, 10,000,000 euro preference shares of nominal value E0.0l
each, 10,000,000 dollar preference shares of nominal value U.S.$0.01 each and
10,000,000 sterling preference shares of nominal value L0.01 each.

     HSBC maintains two share registers, a principal share register in London
and an overseas branch share register in Hong Kong SAR.

VOTING

     Unless otherwise required by the Companies Act or the HSBC Memorandum and
Articles of Association, shareholders vote by ordinary resolution (such as for
the election of directors, the declaration of a dividend, the appointment of
auditors, an increase of authorized share capital or the grant of authority to
allot shares) at general meetings.

     Subject to the restrictions referred to under "-- Restrictions on Voting"
and any special voting rights or restrictions attached to any class of shares,
ordinary resolutions will be decided on a show of hands by a simple majority of
shareholders present and voting at the meeting where each shareholder has one
vote, regardless of the number of shares held, unless a poll is demanded. On a
poll, every holder who is present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote
shall have one vote for each HSBC ordinary share held. Holders of record of HSBC
ordinary shares may appoint a proxy to attend and vote on their behalf.

     The chairman of the meeting has the casting vote in the event of a tie in
either a show of hands or poll vote, in addition to any other vote he may have.

     HSBC will send out written notice at least 21 days before an annual general
meeting or an extraordinary general meeting convened to consider a special
resolution, and at least 14 days before all other extraordinary general
meetings. For general meetings to be valid, at least three shareholders entitled
to vote must be present in person or by proxy.

     A corporate shareholder may appoint a representative to attend and vote at
a general meeting on its behalf.

DISCLOSURE OF INTERESTS IN SHARES

     Section 212 of the Companies Act gives HSBC the power to require persons
whom it believes to be, or to have been within the previous three years,
interested in its voting shares, to disclose prescribed particulars of those
interests. Failure to supply the information required may lead to
disenfranchisement of the relevant shares and, where those shares represent at
least 0.25% of the HSBC ordinary shares in issue, a prohibition on their
transfer and receipt of dividends and other payments in respect of those shares.
In this context, the term "interest" is broadly defined and will generally
include an interest of any kind whatsoever in voting shares, including the
interest of a holder of an HSBC ADS.

     A similar power is given to HSBC by the Securities (Disclosure of
Interests) Ordinance which applies to companies listed on the SEHK.

                                       120
<PAGE>

RESTRICTIONS ON VOTING

     Any shareholder (or any other person appearing to be interested in the
shares) who has been served with a notice under section 212 of the Companies
Act, as described above, and has not given HSBC any information required by the
notice within 14 days from receiving the notice, will not be entitled to be
present or to vote either personally or by proxy at a general meeting unless the
directors determine that this restriction should not apply.

     A shareholder can vote (whether in person or by proxy) and exercise other
rights or privileges as a shareholder only if he has paid all calls or other
amounts presently due.

DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS

     HSBC may, by ordinary resolution, declare dividends, but it may not pay
dividends in excess of the amount recommended by the directors. Except as
otherwise provided by the terms of issue or special rights of any shares,
dividends are declared and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid on the
HSBC ordinary shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of
which the dividends are paid. The board of directors of HSBC may declare and pay
interim dividends. Dividends declared but not yet paid do not bear interest. The
board may deduct from any dividend declared but not yet paid to any person any
amounts due from that person to HSBC on account of calls or otherwise in
relation to the HSBC ordinary shares. The directors may, if authorized by an
ordinary resolution, offer shareholders the right to elect to receive HSBC
ordinary shares instead of cash for the whole or any part of any dividend. The
board can forfeit a shareholder's right to a dividend that remains unclaimed for
12 years. Dividends with respect to HSBC ADSs issued by The Bank of New York (in
its capacity as depositary) will be paid in U.S. dollars or invested in
additional HSBC ADSs for participants in the dividend reinvestment plan operated
by the depositary.

LIQUIDATION

     If HSBC is wound up, after payment of all liabilities and the deduction of
any provision made under section 719 of the Companies Act or section 187 of the
Insolvency Act 1986 (which enables the liquidator to make payments to employees
or former employees on the cessation or transfer of HSBC's business), the
remaining assets available for distribution to holders of the HSBC ordinary
shares will be distributed among the shareholders in proportion to the number of
shares that they hold. On the date of the distribution, the amount paid to any
shareholder whose shares are not fully paid up will be reduced to reflect the
amount owed. After receiving approval of the shareholders by an extraordinary
resolution and meeting any legal requirements, the liquidator may divide the
assets in kind among the shareholders in the manner that it sees fit.

UNTRACED SHAREHOLDERS

     HSBC can sell any HSBC ordinary shares (including any further shares issued
in respect of those HSBC ordinary shares) if the holder has not cashed any
cheque, order or warrant payable and HSBC has not received any communication in
respect of the HSBC ordinary shares from the relevant shareholder (or other
person entitled to the HSBC ordinary shares) for a period of 12 years during
which at least three dividends were payable with respect to the HSBC ordinary
shares. HSBC must advertise its intention to sell the HSBC ordinary shares in
newspapers published in the United Kingdom and in Hong Kong SAR (in the manner
specified in HSBC's Memorandum and Articles of Association) and inform the stock
exchanges on which HSBC ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs are listed and traded.

     HSBC may then sell the HSBC ordinary shares if it does not receive any
response from the shareholder within three months of publishing the
advertisements. After selling the HSBC ordinary shares, HSBC will owe the former
shareholder (or other person previously entitled to the HSBC ordinary shares)
only the sale amount, without interest.

                                       121
<PAGE>

TRANSFER OF SHARES

     HSBC ordinary shares may be transferred by an instrument in any usual form
or in any other form acceptable to the directors. The directors may refuse to
register a transfer:

          (1) if it is of HSBC ordinary shares which are not fully paid (unless
     to do so would prevent dealing in the HSBC ordinary shares taking place on
     an open and proper basis);

          (2) if it is not stamped (if required);

          (3) if it is not duly presented for registration together with the
     share certificate and other evidence of title as the directors reasonably
     require;

          (4) if it is in respect of more than one class of shares or shares
     denominated in different currencies;

          (5) if it is in favor of more than four persons jointly;

          (6) if HSBC has a lien on the shares; or

          (7) in some circumstances, if the holder has failed to provide the
     required particulars as described under "-- Disclosure of Interests in
     Shares."

     The transferor will remain the holder of the shares concerned until the
name of the transferee is entered in the share register in respect of the
transfer.

     If the board refuses to register a transfer of a share it must inform the
transferee of its refusal within two months of receiving the transfer request.
The board must return the refused instrument of transfer to the person
depositing it, except in the case of suspected fraud.

     The registration of transfers may be suspended at any time and for any
periods as the directors may determine, although these suspensions may not
exceed 30 days in any year.

     Unless expressly provided by HSBC's Memorandum and Articles of Association
or required by law or court order, HSBC cannot recognize any person other than
the registered holder of a share as the owner of such share.

UNCERTIFICATED SHARES

     HSBC ordinary shares may be held in uncertificated form. HSBC may refuse to
register a transfer of uncertificated shares only in limited circumstances, such
as where prohibited by court order. Please refer to "-- Disclosure of Interests
in Shares" and "-- Restrictions on Voting."

VARIATION OF CLASS RIGHTS AND ALTERATION OF SHARE CAPITAL

     Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the consent in writing of
the holders of at least three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares in
a class, or the sanction by the shareholders of that class of an extraordinary
resolution passed at a separate general meeting, is required to vary or abrogate
the rights of the class, unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the
shares of that class. Two persons holding or representing by proxy at least
one-third of the nominal amount of the shares of the relevant class must be
present for the separate general meeting to be valid. The issuance of new shares
ranking in priority to or pari passu with an existing class of shares is not
considered to be a "variation" in the rights of already existing shares, unless
the existing shares provide so expressly.

     HSBC may also vary or abrogate rights attached to the HSBC ordinary shares
by a special resolution without the separate consent or sanction of the holders
of any class of HSBC ordinary shares so long as the rights attached to all the
HSBC ordinary shares are varied or abrogated in the same manner and to the same
extent.

     HSBC may issue shares with rights or restrictions as it sees fit, including
redeemable shares, so long as it does so in accordance with the Companies Act
and HSBC's Memorandum and Articles of Association and without reducing any
rights attached to any existing shares.

                                       122
<PAGE>

     HSBC can increase its share capital, consolidate and divide all or any of
its share capital into shares of a larger amount, sub-divide all or any of its
share capital into shares of a smaller amount (subject to the provisions of the
Companies Act) or cancel any shares not taken or agreed to be taken by any
person and reduce the amount of its authorized share capital accordingly.

PRE-EMPTIVE RIGHTS

     As HSBC is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom, in general, its
shareholders have automatic pre-emptive rights pursuant to section 89 of the
Companies Act. These pre-emptive rights can, however, be overridden by a special
resolution of shareholders.

LIEN ON SHARES

     HSBC has a lien on shares which are not fully paid (to the extent permitted
by the Companies Act). The board may waive the lien in whole or in part, or
temporarily, and may sell shares subject to a lien as it sees fit. The board is
entitled to sell a share subject to the lien only after giving 14 days' notice
of its intent to sell in default.

CALLS

     The board may from time to time make calls on the shareholders for any
amounts unpaid on the shares. These calls must be made with 14 days' notice
specifying the time, place and manner of payment which may include payment in
installments. The person on whom a call is made remains liable for the call
despite any subsequent transfer of the shares on which the call was made. The
joint holders of a share are jointly and severally liable for the payment of all
calls.

     Shareholders who have not paid all calls (and any accrued interest) due are
not entitled to receive a dividend or vote at shareholders' meetings either in
person or by proxy (except as proxy for another member), are not counted as
present and may not form part of a quorum.

FORFEITURE OF SHARES

     If any shareholder does not pay any part of any call on or before the
payment date, the board may send the shareholder a notice of the amount unpaid
(including interest and other costs and expenses incurred by HSBC) and if the
shareholder does not pay the amount owed within 14 days after receiving the
notice, the board may forfeit the relevant share, at any time before full
payment is made. The forfeited share and any dividends declared or other moneys
payable in respect of the forfeited share will then become the property of HSBC.

PURCHASE OF SHARES

     HSBC can purchase any of its own shares of any class, including any
redeemable shares, in any manner that it deems fit, subject to the provisions of
the Companies Act, the Hong Kong Code on Share Repurchases, the listing rules of
the UKLA and the SEHK and HSBC's Memorandum and Articles of Association.

                 DESCRIPTION OF HSBC AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES

GENERAL

     The Bank of New York, as depositary, issues HSBC ADSs in certificated or
book-entry form. Each HSBC ADS will represent an ownership interest in five HSBC
ordinary shares which have been deposited with the depositary. The office of The
Bank of New York is located at 101 Barclay Street, 22 West, New York, NY 10286.

     The holder may hold HSBC ADSs either directly or indirectly through his
broker or other financial institution. This description assumes the holder holds
his HSBC ADSs directly. If the holder holds the HSBC ADSs indirectly, he must
rely on the procedures of his broker or other financial institution to assert
the rights of HSBC ADS holders described in this section. Any indirect holder
should consult with his broker or financial institution to find out what those
procedures are.

     The following is a summary of the deposit agreement. Because it is a
summary, it does not contain all the information that may be important to
holders of HSBC ADSs. For more complete information, the holder should read the
entire agreement and the American Depositary Receipt, or ADR, evidencing the
HSBC ADSs. Copies of the agreement and the ADR will be available for inspection
at the office of The Bank of New York. The laws of the State of New York govern
the deposit agreement.

     The term deposited securities, as used in this description, includes HSBC
ordinary shares deposited under the deposit agreement and other securities, cash
and property received by The Bank of New York in respect of the HSBC ordinary
shares, or in respect of any other securities, property or cash previously
received, and held under the deposit agreement.

DEPOSIT AND WITHDRAWAL OF DEPOSITED SECURITIES

     The Bank of New York will issue the HSBC ADSs that the holder is entitled
to receive against deposits of HSBC ordinary shares. The Bank of New York will
issue additional HSBC ADSs if the holder or his broker deposits HSBC ordinary
shares, along with any appropriate instruments of transfer or endorsement, with
the custodian. The Bank of New York may also require the holder to deliver
evidence of necessary governmental approvals and an agreement transferring his
right as a shareholder to receive dividends or other property. Upon payment of
its fees and of any taxes or charges, such as stamp taxes or stock transfer
taxes or fees, The Bank of New York will register the appropriate number of HSBC
ADSs in the names the holder requests and will issue book-entry HSBC ADSs or, if
the holder specifically requests, deliver certificates representing the HSBC
ADSs at its New York office to the persons the holder requests.

     The holder may submit a written request to withdraw HSBC ordinary shares
and turn in his certificated HSBC ADSs, if any, at the New York office of The
Bank of New York. Upon payment of its fees and of any taxes or charges, such as
stamp taxes, stock transfer taxes or fees, The Bank of New York will deliver at
the office of its custodian in London the deposited securities underlying the
HSBC ADSs, and at The Bank of New York's New York office any dividends or
distributions with respect to the deposited securities represented by the HSBC
ADSs, or any proceeds from the sale of any dividends, distributions or rights
held by The Bank of New York. Alternatively, at the holder's request, risk and
expense, The Bank of New York will deliver the deposited securities at its New
York office.

DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS

     The Bank of New York will pay the holder of HSBC ADSs the cash dividends or
other distributions it or the custodian receives on HSBC ordinary shares or
other deposited securities, after deducting its fees and expenses (if any). The
holder will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of HSBC
ordinary shares his HSBC ADSs represent.

                                       124
<PAGE>

 CASH

     The Bank of New York will convert any cash dividend or other cash
distribution HSBC pays on the HSBC ordinary shares, other than any dividend or
distribution paid in U.S. dollars, into U.S. dollars. If that is not possible on
a reasonable basis, or if any approval from any government is needed and cannot
be obtained, the deposit agreement allows The Bank of New York to distribute the
non-U.S. currency only to those HSBC ADS holders to whom it is possible to do so
or to hold the non-U.S. currency it cannot convert for the account of the HSBC
ADS holders who have not been paid. It will not invest the non-U.S. currency and
it will not be liable for any interest.

     Before making a distribution, The Bank of New York will deduct any
withholding taxes that must be paid under applicable laws. It will distribute
only whole U.S. dollars and cents and will add any fractional cents to the next
distribution.

 SHARES

     The Bank of New York will distribute new HSBC ADSs representing any HSBC
ordinary shares HSBC distributes as a dividend or free distribution, if HSBC
requests it to make this distribution. The Bank of New York will only distribute
whole HSBC ADSs. It may sell HSBC ordinary shares which would require it to
issue a fractional HSBC ADS and distribute the net proceeds in the same way as
it does with cash. If The Bank of New York does not distribute additional cash
or HSBC ADSs, each HSBC ADS will also represent the new HSBC ordinary shares.

 RIGHTS TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL SHARES

     If HSBC offers holders of securities any rights to subscribe for additional
HSBC ordinary shares or any other rights, The Bank of New York will take actions
necessary to make these rights available to the holder of HSBC ADSs. If The Bank
of New York determines that it is not legal or not feasible to make these rights
available to the holder, The Bank of New York may sell the rights and allocate
the net proceeds to holders' accounts. The Bank of New York may allow rights
that are not distributed or sold to lapse.

     If The Bank of New York makes rights available to the holder of HSBC ADSs,
upon instruction from the holder it will exercise the rights and purchase the
HSBC ordinary shares on his behalf. The Bank of New York will then deposit the
HSBC ordinary shares and issue HSBC ADSs to the holder. The Bank of New York
will only exercise rights if the holder pays it the exercise price and any other
charges the rights require the holder to pay.

     U.S. securities laws may restrict the sale, deposit, cancellation and
transfer of the HSBC ADSs issued after exercise of rights. In this case, The
Bank of New York may issue the HSBC ADSs under a separate restricted deposit
agreement which will contain the same provisions as the deposit agreement,
except for changes needed to put the restrictions in place. The Bank of New York
will not offer the holder rights unless those rights and the securities to which
the rights relate are either exempt from registration or have been registered
under the Securities Act with respect to a distribution to the holder. HSBC will
have no obligation to register under the Securities Act those rights or the
securities to which they relate.

 OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS

     The Bank of New York will send to the holder anything else HSBC distributes
on deposited securities by any means The Bank of New York thinks is legal, fair
and practical. If it cannot make the distribution in that way, The Bank of New
York may decide to sell what HSBC distributed -- for example by public or
private sale -- and distribute the net proceeds, in the same way as it does with
cash.

     HSBC will have no obligation to take any other action to permit the
distribution of HSBC ADSs, HSBC ordinary shares, rights or anything else to HSBC
ADS holders.

RECLASSIFICATIONS, RECAPITALIZATIONS AND MERGERS

     If HSBC:

     - changes the nominal or par value of any of the HSBC ordinary shares,

     - reclassifies, splits or consolidates any of the HSBC ordinary shares,

     - distributes securities on any of the HSBC ordinary shares which are not
       in turn distributed to HSBC ADS holders, or

     - recapitalizes, reorganizes, merges, consolidates, sells its assets, or
       takes any similar action,

the cash, shares or other securities received by The Bank of New York will
become new deposited securities under the deposit agreement. Each HSBC ADS will
automatically represent its equal share of the new deposited securities. The
Bank of New York will, if HSBC asks it to, issue new HSBC ADSs or ask the holder
to surrender his outstanding HSBC ADSs in exchange for new HSBC ADSs identifying
the new deposited securities.

RECORD DATES

     Each time a dividend is payable or other distribution is made, or a meeting
of shareholders is scheduled, HSBC may set a record date to establish the
shareholders eligible to receive the dividend or distribution or to attend the
meeting. The Bank of New York will coordinate with HSBC to fix any dividend
record date relating to the HSBC ADSs to the same dividend record date as
established by HSBC.

VOTING RIGHTS

     The HSBC ADS holder may instruct The Bank of New York, as depositary, as to
the exercise of voting rights at HSBC's shareholder meetings of holders of the
same class of securities as the deposited securities represented by HSBC ADSs.

     The Bank of New York will enable the holder to attend and on a poll vote at
a meeting by appointing him its proxy for the HSBC ordinary shares or other
deposited securities underlying his HSBC ADSs. If the holder does not wish to
attend a meeting, the holder may instruct The Bank of New York to appoint
another person to attend and on a poll vote on the holder's behalf.

     The Bank of New York will notify the holder of the upcoming meeting and
arrange to deliver relevant materials to him. The materials will (1) describe
the meeting time, place and the matters to be voted on and (2) explain how the
holder may give instructions for his HSBC ordinary shares to be voted. For
instructions to be valid, The Bank of New York must receive them on or before
the date specified in the instructions. The Bank of New York will, to the extent
practical, subject to applicable law and the provisions of HSBC's Memorandum and
Articles of Association, vote the HSBC ordinary shares or other deposited
securities as the holder instructs. The Bank of New York will only vote as the
holder instructs.

     Although The Bank of New York will try to send the notice of the meeting
reasonably in advance of the meeting, HSBC will not be able to assure that the
holder will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that the holder can
give instructions for his HSBC ordinary shares to be voted. In addition, The
Bank of New York and its agents are not responsible for failing to carry out
voting instructions or for the manner of carrying out voting instructions.

DISCLOSURE OF INTERESTS

     The obligation of a holder of HSBC ordinary shares and other persons with
an interest in the HSBC ordinary shares to disclose information to HSBC under
English law and Hong Kong SAR law applies to HSBC ADS holders and any other
persons with an interest in the HSBC ADSs. The consequence of failure to comply
with these provisions will be the same for an HSBC ADS holder and any other
persons with an interest in the HSBC ADS as for a holder of HSBC ordinary
shares. Please refer to "-- Description of HSBC Ordinary Shares -- Disclosure of
Interests in Shares." The Bank of New York will co-operate with HSBC's efforts
to comply with the disclosure requirements and ownership limitations.

AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE DEPOSIT AGREEMENT

     HSBC may agree with The Bank of New York to amend, for any reason, the
deposit agreement and the HSBC ADSs without the holder's consent. If the
amendment adds or increases fees or charges, except for taxes and other
governmental charges, or prejudices an important right of HSBC ADS holders, it
will only become effective 30 days after The Bank of New York notifies the
holder of the amendment. At the time an amendment becomes effective, the holder
is considered, by continuing to hold his HSBC ADSs, to agree to the amendment
and to be bound by the agreement as amended. However, no amendment will impair
the holder's right to receive the deposited securities in exchange for his HSBC
ADSs.

     The Bank of New York will terminate the deposit agreement if HSBC asks it
to do so in which case it must notify the holder at least 90 days before
termination. The Bank of New York may also terminate the agreement if The Bank
of New York informs HSBC that it would like to resign and HSBC does not appoint
a new depositary bank within 90 days.

     After termination, The Bank of New York and its agents will be required to
do only the following under the agreement: (l) collect dividends and other
distributions on the deposited securities, (2) sell rights offered to holders of
deposited securities and (3) deliver shares and other deposited securities upon
cancellation of HSBC ADSs. At any time after one year following termination of
the deposit agreement, The Bank of New York may sell any remaining deposited
securities. After that, The Bank of New York will hold the money it received on
the sale, as well as any other cash it is holding under the deposit agreement,
for the pro rata benefit of the HSBC ADS holders that have not surrendered their
HSBC ADSs. The Bank of New York will not invest the money and will have no
liability for interest. The Bank of New York's only obligations will be to
account for the money and other cash. After termination, HSBC's only obligations
will be with respect to indemnification and to pay specified amounts to The Bank
of New York.

</Table>

LIABILITY OF HOLDER FOR TAXES

     The Bank of New York may deduct the amount of any taxes owed from any
payments to the holder. It may also restrict the transfer of the holder's HSBC
ADSs or restrict the withdrawal of the holder's underlying deposited securities
until the holder pays any taxes owed on his HSBC ADSs or underlying securities.
It may also sell deposited securities, by public or private sale, to pay any
taxes owed. The holder will remain liable if the proceeds of the sale are not
enough to pay the taxes. If The Bank of New York sells deposited securities, it
will, if appropriate, reduce the number of HSBC ADSs to reflect the sale and pay
to the holder any proceeds, or send to the holder any property, remaining after
it has paid. The merger agreement provides that holders of Household common
stock and stock options will generally not be required to pay any fee or other
charge or expense to The Bank of New York, or any stamp duties, stamp duty
reserve tax or other similar charges of a taxing authority relating to the
issuance of HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs in the merger or on the exercise
of options that have been converted to HSBC options under the merger agreement.

LIMITATIONS ON OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITY TO HSBC ADS HOLDERS

     The deposit agreement expressly limits HSBC's obligations and the
obligations of The Bank of New York. It also limits HSBC's liability and the
liability of The Bank of New York. HSBC and The Bank of New York:

     - are only obligated to take the actions specifically set forth in the
       deposit agreement without negligence or bad faith;

     - are not liable if either of them is prevented or delayed by law, any
       provision of HSBC's Memorandum and Articles of Association or
       circumstances beyond their control from performing their obligations
       under the agreement;

     - are not liable if either of them exercises, or fails to exercise,
       discretion permitted under the agreement;

     - have no obligation to become involved in a lawsuit or other proceeding
       related to the HSBC ADSs or the agreement on a holder's behalf or on
       behalf of any other party unless they are indemnified to their
       satisfaction; and

     - may rely upon any advice of or information from any legal counsel,
       accountants, any person depositing HSBC ordinary shares, any HSBC ADS
       holder or any other person whom they believe in good faith is competent
       to give them that advice or information.

     In the deposit agreement, HSBC and The Bank of New York agree to indemnify
each other under specified circumstances.

HOLDER'S RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE HSBC ORDINARY SHARES UNDERLYING HSBC ADSS

     The holder of HSBC ADSs has the right to cancel his HSBC ADSs and withdraw
the underlying shares at any time, except (i) when The Bank of New York or HSBC
has closed its transfer books (for example, to permit voting at a shareholders'
meeting or when HSBC is paying a dividend on the HSBC ordinary shares); (ii)
when the holder seeking to withdraw HSBC ordinary shares owes money to pay fees,
taxes and similar charges; or (iii) when it is necessary to prohibit withdrawals
in order to comply with any laws or governmental regulations that apply to HSBC
ADSs or to the withdrawal of HSBC ordinary shares or other deposited securities.

     This right of withdrawal may not be limited by any other provision of the
deposit agreement.

     The Bank of New York will keep books at its transfer office in New York
City for the registration and transfer of HSBC ADSs which will be open for
inspection by the holders of HSBC ADSs and HSBC at all reasonable times. Any
reports and communications that HSBC sends to The Bank of New York or the
custodian or otherwise makes available to shareholders are available for
inspection by the holders of HSBC ADSs and HSBC at The Bank of New York's New
York City transfer office.

PRE-RELEASE OF HSBC ADSS

     The Bank of New York may issue HSBC ADSs before deposit of the underlying
HSBC ordinary shares. This is called a pre-release of HSBC ADSs. The Bank of New
York may also deliver HSBC ordinary shares prior to the receipt and cancellation
of pre-released HSBC ADSs even if the HSBC ADSs are cancelled before the
pre-release transaction has been closed out. A pre-release is closed out as soon
as the underlying HSBC ordinary shares are delivered to The Bank of New York.
The Bank of New York may receive HSBC ADSs instead of HSBC ordinary shares to
close out a pre-release. The Bank of New York may pre-release HSBC ADSs only
under the following conditions: (1) before or at the time of the pre-release,
the person to whom the pre-release is being made must represent to The Bank of
New York in writing that it or its customer, as the case may be, owns the HSBC
ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs to be remitted; (2) the pre-release must be fully
collateralized with cash or other collateral that The Bank of New York considers
appropriate; (3) The Bank of New York must be able to close out the pre-release
on not more than three business days' notice. The pre-release will be subject to
whatever indemnities and credit regulations that The

                                       129
<PAGE>

Bank of New York considers appropriate. In addition, The Bank of New York will
limit the number of HSBC ADSs that may be outstanding at any time as a result of
pre-release.

ACTIONS BY HOLDERS

     The Bank of New York, or its nominee, will take limited actions as the
holder may reasonably request in writing, to enable him to exercise the rights
to which shareholders of HSBC will be entitled. These actions will be taken to
the extent practicable and subject to any applicable law or regulation and at
the holder's expense. The Bank of New York, or its nominee, may require the
holder to indemnify it with respect to these actions.

REQUIREMENTS FOR DEPOSITARY ACTIONS

     Before The Bank of New York will issue or register the transfer of an HSBC
ADS, make a distribution on an HSBC ADS or permit withdrawal of HSBC ordinary
shares, HSBC or The Bank of New York may require:

     - payment of stock transfer or other taxes or governmental charges and
       transfer or registration fees charged by third parties for the transfer
       of any HSBC ordinary shares or other deposited securities, as well as the
       fees of The Bank of New York;

     - production of satisfactory proof of the identity of the person presenting
       HSBC ordinary shares for deposit or HSBC ADSs upon withdrawal, and of the
       authenticity of any signature or other information they deem necessary;
       and

     - compliance with regulations The Bank of New York may establish consistent
       with the deposit agreement, including presentation of transfer documents.

             COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOUSEHOLD COMMON STOCKHOLDERS
                         AND HSBC ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS

     As a result of the merger, holders of Household common stock will receive
either, at their election, HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs. The following is a
summary comparison of material differences between the rights of a Household
common stockholder and an HSBC ordinary shareholder arising from the differences
between the corporate laws of Delaware and of England and Wales, the governing
instruments of the two companies, and the securities laws and regulations
governing the two companies. As HSBC has dual primary listings on the Official
List of the UKLA and on the SEHK, HSBC is also subject to various Hong Kong SAR
securities laws and regulations and some of these are referred to in this
comparison. This summary is not a complete description of the laws of Delaware,
England and Wales or Hong Kong SAR, the other rules, regulations or laws
referred to in this summary, Household's Certificate of Incorporation,
Household's by-laws or HSBC's Memorandum and Articles of Association. For
information as to where the governing instruments of Household and HSBC may be
obtained, please refer to "Where You Can Find More Information." You are
encouraged to obtain and read these documents.

     For a description of the HSBC ordinary shares and HSBC ADSs and a
discussion of the ways in which the rights of holders of HSBC ADSs may differ
from those of holders of HSBC ordinary shares, please refer to "Description of
HSBC Ordinary Shares" and "Description of HSBC American Depositary Shares."

                                                   reaching the nine-tenths level, require
                                                   shareholders who do not accept the offer
                                                   to transfer their shares on the terms of
                                                   the offer. A dissenting shareholder may
                                                   object to the transfer or its proposed
                                                   terms by applying to the court within six
                                                   weeks of the date on which notice of the
                                                   transfer was given. In the absence of
                                                   fraud or oppression, the court is unlikely
                                                   to order that the acquisition should not
                                                   take effect, but it may specify terms of
                                                   the transfer that it finds appropriate. A
                                                   minority shareholder is also entitled in
                                                   these circumstances, in the alternative,
                                                   to require the offeror to acquire his
                                                   shares on the terms of the offer.

                             VALIDITY OF SECURITIES

     Norton Rose, London, England, will pass upon the validity under English law
of the HSBC ordinary shares to be issued pursuant to the merger.

                                    EXPERTS

     The consolidated financial statements of HSBC as of December 31, 2000 and
2001 and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2001
have been audited and reported upon by KPMG Audit Plc, Chartered Accountants and
Registered Auditors. Such financial statements have been incorporated by
reference herein and in the registration statement in reliance upon the report
with respect thereto of KPMG Audit Plc, incorporated by reference herein, and
upon the authority of said firm as experts in accounting and auditing.

     With respect to the unaudited interim financial information of HSBC as of
June 30, 2002, and for the six months then ended, incorporated by reference
herein, KPMG Audit Plc has reported that they applied limited procedures in
accordance with professional standards in both the United Kingdom and the United
States for a review of such information. However, their separate report included
in HSBC's interim report as furnished on Form 6-K containing interim results for
the six-month period ended June 30, 2002, and incorporated by reference herein,
states that they did not audit and they do not express an opinion on that
interim financial information. Accordingly, the degree of reliance on their
report on such information should be restricted in light of the limited nature
of the review procedures applied. KPMG Audit Plc is not subject to the liability
provisions of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 for their report on the
unaudited interim financial information of HSBC because that report is not a
report or a part of the registration statement prepared or certified by KPMG
Audit Plc within the meaning of Sections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act of 1933.

     The financial information in respect of HSBC contained in this document
(and in any information incorporated by reference into this document other than
HSBC's annual report on Form 20-F/A) does not constitute statutory accounts
within the meaning of Section 240 of the Companies Act 1985. Full audited
accounts for HSBC Holdings plc for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies in England and Wales and
KPMG Audit Plc has given reports under Section 235 of the Companies Act on such
accounts, which were unqualified reports within the meaning of Section 237(2) or
(3).

     The consolidated financial statements and schedule of Household as of
December 31, 2000 and 2001 and for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2001 have been audited and reported upon by KPMG LLP,
independent accountants. Such financial statements and schedule have been
incorporated by reference herein and in the registration statement in reliance
upon the report with respect thereto of KPMG LLP, incorporated by reference
herein, and upon the authority of said firm as experts in accounting and
auditing.

     With respect to the unaudited interim financial information of Household as
of June 30, 2002, and for the six months then ended, incorporated by reference
herein, KPMG LLP has reported that they applied limited procedures in accordance
with professional standards in the United States for a review of such
information. However, their report with respect thereto, incorporated by
reference herein, states that they did not audit and they do not express an
opinion on that interim financial information. Accordingly, the degree of
reliance on their report on such information should be restricted in light of
the limited nature of the review procedures applied. KPMG LLP is not subject to
the liability provisions of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 for their
report on the unaudited interim financial information of Household because that
report is not a report or a part of the registration statement prepared or
certified by KPMG LLP within the meaning of Sections 7 and 11 of the Securities
Act of 1933.

                     CIRCULAR AND U.K. LISTING PARTICULARS

     HSBC is convening an extraordinary general meeting of its ordinary
shareholders, and distributing to those shareholders a circular in accordance
with the listing rules of the UKLA and the SEHK relating to the merger. HSBC
will also deliver a copy of a document comprising the U.K. listing particulars
relating to the merger in accordance with the listing rules of the UKLA to the
Registrar of Companies in England and Wales for registration. Each of these
documents will be available for inspection at the offices of Norton Rose,
Kempson House, Camomile Street, London, EC3A 7AN, England, HSBC Holdings plc, 8
Canada Square, London E14 5HQ, England and The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation Limited, Level 37, 1 Queen's Road Central, Hong Kong SAR until the
date on which the merger becomes effective. Summary particulars are attached as
Annex E to this document. Neither the circular, the listing particulars nor the
documents listed in the summary particulars as available for inspection form
part of, or are incorporated into, this document, except to the extent
specifically provided herein.

                          FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

     Household intends to hold an annual meeting in 2003 only if the merger is
not completed. To be eligible for inclusion, stockholder proposals were required
to be received by Household's Corporate Secretary no later than December 5,
2002. Stockholders wishing to present a proposal from the floor of the 2003
annual meeting (if it is held), were required to submit such proposals to
Household's Corporate Secretary no earlier than December 14, 2002 or later than
January 14, 2003. If Household does not receive notice by the deadline of any
other matter which a shareholder desires to bring before the 2003 annual meeting
which is not the subject of a proposal timely submitted for inclusion in the
proxy statement, then the proxies designated by the Household board for that
meeting may vote in their discretion on any such matter without mention of the
matter in Household's proxy statement or proxy card for that annual meeting.

                      WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION

     HSBC files annual and special reports and other information and Household
files annual, quarterly and special reports, proxy statements and other
information with the SEC. You may read and copy any reports, statements or other
information on file at the SEC's public reference room located at 450 Fifth
Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20549. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0300 for
further information on the availability of the public reference room.
Household's and HSBC's SEC filings are available to the public from commercial
document retrieval services and at the Internet world wide web site maintained
by the SEC at www.sec.gov.

     HSBC has filed a registration statement on Form F-4 to register with the
SEC the HSBC ordinary shares that Household stockholders will receive in the
merger. This document is a part of the registration statement on Form F-4 and
constitutes a prospectus of HSBC, as well as being a proxy statement for
Household for its special meeting.

     The SEC permits HSBC and Household to "incorporate by reference"
information into this document. This means that the companies can disclose
important information to you by referring to another document filed separately
with the SEC. The information incorporated by reference is deemed to be part of
this document, except for any information superseded by information contained
directly in this document.

     This document incorporates by reference the documents set forth below that
have been previously filed with or furnished to the SEC. These documents contain
important information about HSBC and Household and their respective financial
conditions.

     3.1 Effect on Capital Stock.  At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any stock of the
Company or Merger Sub:

        (a) Common Merger Consideration.  Each share of Company Common Stock,
$1.00 par value per share (each, a "Common Share"), issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other

                                       A-8

than shares (i) owned by Parent or any subsidiary of the Company or Parent,
unless held for the account or benefit of any customer, client or other Person,
or (ii) held in treasury by the Company (collectively, "Excluded Shares")),
shall be converted into the right to receive, in accordance with this Article
III, 2.675 (the "Common Exchange Ratio") ordinary shares of Parent, of nominal
value U.S. $0.50 each ("Parent Ordinary Shares"). Each holder of converted and
cancelled Common Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall have the right to
elect (in respect of each separate beneficial owner) to receive, in lieu of each
of the Parent Ordinary Shares such beneficial owner has the right to receive
pursuant to the prior sentence, 0.535 American depositary shares (the "Parent
Depositary Shares") per Common Share, each such Parent Depositary Share
representing the right to receive five Parent Ordinary Shares (such Parent
Ordinary Shares or Parent Depositary Shares to be issued to holders of Common
Shares, the "Common Merger Consideration"). The Parent Depositary Shares may be
evidenced by one or more American depositary receipts ("Parent ADRs") issued in
accordance with the Deposit Agreement among Parent, The Bank of New York, as
depositary (the "Depositary"), and holders and beneficial owners from time to
time of Parent ADRs issued thereunder (as amended from time to time, the
"Deposit Agreement").

          (b) Preferred Merger Consideration.

          (i) Each share of Company 7 5/8% Preferred Stock issued and
     outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded

     in accordance with this Article III, cash in the amount of $1,000 ($25 per
     depositary share) plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends to but
     excluding the Closing Date, without interest.

          (ii) Each share of Company 7.50% Preferred Stock issued and
     outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
     Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive,
     in accordance with this Article III, cash in the amount of $1,000 ($25 per

     excluding the Closing Date, without interest.

          (iii) Each share of Company 7.60% Preferred Stock issued and
     outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
     Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive,

          (iv) Each share of Company 8 1/4% Preferred Stock issued and

     in accordance with this Article III, cash in the amount of $1,000 ($25 per
     depositary share) plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends to but
     excluding the Closing Date, without interest.

        (c) Cancellation of Shares.  All Common Shares and Preferred Shares
(which term, for purposes of this Article III, shall mean only those Preferred
Shares referenced in Section 3.1(b)(i)-(iv) above) shall no longer be
outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each certificate (a "Certificate") formerly representing any of such Common
Shares or Preferred Shares (other than Excluded Shares), shall thereafter
represent only the right to the Common Merger Consideration (and the right, if
any, to receive pursuant to Section 3.2(d) cash in lieu of a fractional Parent
Ordinary Share or Parent Depositary Share and any distribution or dividend
pursuant to Section 3.2(b)) or the Preferred Merger Consideration, respectively,
in each case without interest. The Parent Ordinary Shares and the Parent
Depositary Shares issued in accordance with this Article III shall be of the
same class and shall have the same rights as the currently outstanding Parent
Ordinary Shares and the currently outstanding Parent Depositary Shares,
respectively. The Surviving Corporation shall be liable for all stamp duties,
stamp duty reserve tax and other similar Taxes imposed in connection with the
issuance or creation of Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent Depositary Shares
constituting Common Merger Consideration and any Parent ADRs in connection
therewith and any deliveries thereof by the Exchange Agent in accordance with
Section 3.2(a) or Section 3.2(b) below (including any United Kingdom stamp duty,
stamp duty reserve tax or other similar Taxing Authority charge (or any interest
or penalties thereon) that may be payable by the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent or Parent pursuant to the Deposit Agreement). Subject to Section
3.2(a)(iii) below, no holder of Common Shares or Company Stock Options shall be
obligated to pay any fee or other charge or expense to the Depositary or any
stamp duties, stamp duty reserve tax or other similar Taxing Authority charges
in

                                       A-9
<PAGE>

connection with the issuance of any Parent Ordinary Shares, Parent Depositary
Shares or Parent ADRs pursuant to either the Merger or the exercise of Adjusted
Options and any deliveries thereof by the Exchange Agent in accordance with
Section 3.2(a) and Section 3.2(b) below (for avoidance of doubt, the parties
agree that the provisions of this sentence shall not apply to any subsequent
transfer of Parent Ordinary Shares, Parent Depositary Shares or Parent ADRs or
delivery or subsequent deposit pursuant to the Deposit Agreement).

          (d) Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share
     ("Merger Sub Common Stock"), of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled.

          (e) Issuance of Surviving Corporation Shares. In consideration for the
     delivery, in accordance with Section 3.2(a), of the Parent Ordinary Shares
     referred to in Section 3.1(f), the Surviving Corporation shall issue to
     Parent at the Effective Time 50 shares of common stock of the Surviving
     Corporation.

          (f) Delivery of Parent Ordinary Shares and Cash. In consideration of
     the cancellation of Common Shares and Preferred Shares pursuant to Section
     3.1(c) and the issue to Parent by the Surviving Corporation of shares of
     common stock of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 3.1(e),
     Parent shall deliver to the Exchange Agent (i) such number of Parent
     Ordinary Shares as is equal to the number of Common Shares outstanding as
     of the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) multiplied by the Common
     Exchange Ratio for purposes of giving effect to the delivery of the Common
     Merger Consideration referred to in Section 3.1(a) and (ii) cash in the
     amount required to pay the Preferred Merger Consideration in accordance
     with Section 3.1(b).

     3.2 Exchange of Certificates.

          (a) Exchange Agent and Procedures.

          (i) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint the Bank of New
     York or another agent reasonably acceptable to the Company, as exchange
     agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of acting solely as an agent
     in exchanging Certificates for Parent Ordinary Shares, Parent Depositary
     Shares or cash in accordance with this Article III. Promptly after the
     Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to
     send to each holder of record of Common Shares and Preferred Shares (other
     than Excluded Shares) as of the Effective Time (x) a letter of transmittal
     which shall require holders of Common Shares to elect to take Common Merger
     Consideration either in the form of Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent
     Depositary Shares, and which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
     and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
     delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, such letter of
     transmittal to be in such form and to have such other provisions as the
     Company and Parent shall reasonably specify, and (y) instructions for use
     in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for (A) in the
     case of Certificates representing Common Shares, (1) the Common Merger
     Consideration and (2) if applicable, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent
     Ordinary Shares or Parent Depositary Shares in accordance with Section
     3.2(d) and unpaid dividends or other distributions in accordance with
     Section 3.2(b), and (B) in the case of Certificates representing Preferred
     Shares, the applicable Preferred Merger Consideration. In the case of
     Common Shares, such letter of transmittal shall also permit the holder of
     record as of the Effective Time of Common Shares submitting the same who
     elects to receive Parent Ordinary Shares to choose to hold such Parent
     Ordinary Shares in certificated or uncertificated form. The Exchange Agent
     will act solely as nominee for the holders of record of Common Shares and
     Preferred Shares (other than Excluded Shares) as of the Effective Time in
     relation to the actions required by the Exchange Agent under this Article
     III.

          (ii) Each holder of any Common Shares that have been converted into a
     right to receive the Common Merger Consideration set forth in Section
     3.1(a) shall, upon surrender of a Certificate representing Common Shares
     for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with a properly completed
     letter of transmittal, duly executed, be entitled to receive in exchange
     therefor (x) that whole number of Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent
     Depositary Shares that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
     Article III and (y) a check in the amount (after giving effect to any tax
     withholdings required by

                                       A-10
<PAGE>

     applicable law) of (A) any cash in lieu of a fractional Parent Ordinary
     Share or a fractional Parent Depositary Share in accordance with Section
     3.2(d), plus (B) if applicable, any unpaid dividends or other distributions
     that such holder has the right to receive in accordance with Section
     3.2(b), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No
     interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender
     of the Certificates. Subject to the receipt of a duly completed and validly
     executed letter of transmittal with respect to Common Shares electing to
     receive Parent Depositary Shares together with delivery of a Certificate in
     the proper form required by the letter of transmittal, Parent shall issue
     the Ordinary Shares to the Depositary (or as it may direct) as and when
     required for the delivery of Parent Depositary Shares in accordance with
     this Article III. Parent shall procure that the Exchange Agent requisitions
     from the Depositary, from time to time, Parent ADRs representing such
     number of Parent Depositary Shares, in such denominations as the Exchange
     Agent shall specify, as are issuable in respect of Common Shares the
     holders of which have elected to receive Parent Depositary Shares and for
     which Certificates have been delivered to the Exchange Agent. Subject to
     the receipt of a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal
     with respect to Common Shares electing to receive Parent Ordinary Shares
     together with delivery of a Certificate in the proper form required by the
     letter of transmittal, Parent shall cause to be delivered to each Person
     entitled thereto Parent Ordinary Shares pursuant to this Section
     3.2(a)(ii), credited as fully paid, and will cause such Person's name to be
     entered in the register of members of Parent and, except where such Person
     has requested such Parent Ordinary Shares to be issued in uncertificated
     form, a certificate in respect thereof shall be issued to such Person.
     Where such Person has requested such Parent Ordinary Shares to be issued in
     uncertificated form, Parent shall cause such Parent Ordinary Shares to be
     duly delivered in accordance with the instructions given by the Person
     entitled thereto and in accordance with the rules of the CREST system.

          (iii) In the event of the surrender of a Certificate representing
     Common Shares or Preferred Shares which are not registered in the transfer
     records of the Company under the name of the Person surrendering such
     Certificate, the proper number of Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent
     Depositary Shares, as the case may be, and/or a check for any cash to be
     paid upon due surrender of the Certificate and any other dividends or
     distributions in respect thereof, shall be issued or otherwise delivered
     and/or paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing
     such Common Shares or Preferred Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent,
     accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect
     such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have
     been paid. If any Parent Ordinary Shares, Parent Depositary Shares or cash,
     as the case may be, are to be delivered to a Person whose name is other
     than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
     registered, it shall be a condition of such delivery that the Person
     requesting such delivery shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes
     required to be paid by reason of such delivery to a Person whose name is
     other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered to
     the extent that such Taxes are greater than those Taxes which would have
     been payable by the Surviving Corporation under Section 3.1(c) had the
     relevant Parent Ordinary Shares, Parent Depositary Shares or cash been
     delivered to the relevant registered holder of such Certificate or shall
     establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been
     paid or is not applicable.

        (b) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.  Subject to the
subsequent sentences of this Section 3.2(b), all Parent Ordinary Shares issued
in respect of Common Shares pursuant to the Merger (including Parent Ordinary
Shares underlying Parent Depositary Shares) shall be entitled to all dividends
or other distributions declared by Parent in respect of the Parent Ordinary
Shares the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time; provided
that such Parent Ordinary Shares have been issued on or prior to such record
date. No dividends or other distributions in respect of the Parent Ordinary
Shares shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate representing
Common Shares until such Certificate is surrendered for exchange in accordance
with this Article III. Subject to the effect of applicable escheat or similar
laws, following surrender of any such Certificate representing Common Shares,
there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the Parent Ordinary Shares or
Parent Depositary Shares issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at
the time of such issuance, the dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such Parent
Ordinary Shares or Parent Depositary Shares and not paid and/or (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with

                                       A-11
<PAGE>

respect to such Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent Depositary Shares with a record
date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to the issuance
of the Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent Depositary Shares issuable with respect
to such Certificate.

     (c) Closing of Transfer Books.  At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company with respect to Common Shares and Preferred Shares shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Common
Shares or the Preferred Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time thereafter on the records of the Company.

     (d) Fractional Shares.

          (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fraction
     of a Parent Ordinary Share or Parent Depositary Share will be issued as
     Common Merger Consideration and any holder of Common Shares entitled to
     receive a fraction of a Parent Ordinary Share or Parent Depositary Share
     but for this Section 3.2(d) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in
     lieu thereof, which payment shall (subject to paragraph (ii) below)
     represent such holder's proportionate interest in the net proceeds (after
     commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs,
     including customary expenses of the Exchange Agent in connection with such
     sale) from the sale by the Exchange Agent on behalf of such holders of the
     fractions of Parent Ordinary Shares (including Parent Ordinary Shares
     underlying Parent Depositary Shares) that would otherwise be issued (the
     "Excess Shares"), which sales shall be executed from time to time as
     appropriate. The sales of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be
     executed on the LSE through one or more brokers nominated by the Parent
     with the pounds sterling sale proceeds being converted into U.S. dollars at
     the spot rate of exchange at the date of sale and remitted to the Exchange
     Agent as soon as practicable thereafter. Until the net proceeds of such
     sale have been distributed to the holders of Common Shares entitled
     thereto, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such
     holders of Common Shares entitled thereto. Parent shall deliver to the
     Exchange Agent (or as the Exchange Agent may request from time to time) the
     Excess Shares for sale in accordance with this Section 3.2(d).

          (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.2(d)(i), Parent may
     elect at its option, exercised prior to the Effective Time, in lieu of the
     issuance and sale of Excess Shares and the making of the payments
     hereinabove contemplated, to pay each former holder of Common Shares an
     amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the
     fractional share interest to which such former holder (after taking into
     account all Common Shares held of record at the Effective Time by such
     holder) would otherwise be entitled by (B) (x) the closing mid-market price
     (disregarding extended hours) on the Effective Date of the Parent Ordinary
     Shares (as reported in the Daily Official List of the UKLA) if the former
     holders of such Common Shares shall have elected to receive Parent Ordinary
     Shares, or (y) the closing price (disregarding extended hours) of the
     Parent Depositary Shares (as reported on the NYSE Composite Transaction
     Tape (as reported in the Wall Street Journal (National Edition), or, if not
     reported therein, any other authoritative source)) if the holder shall have
     elected to receive Parent Depositary Shares), and, in such case, all
     references herein to the cash proceeds of the sale of the Excess Shares and
     similar references shall be deemed to mean and refer to the payments
     calculated as set forth in this Section 3.2(d)(ii).

     (e) Termination of Entitlement.  If any Certificates shall not have been
surrendered within twelve months following the Effective Date, to the extent
permitted by applicable law (x) the entitlement of the holder of such
Certificate to Common Merger Consideration or Preferred Merger Consideration, as
the case may be, to any cash payment in lieu of a fractional entitlement
pursuant to Section 3.2(d), and to any dividends or other distributions of
Parent pursuant to Section 3.2(b) shall be extinguished absolutely and from that
time the Exchange Agent shall no longer act as nominee for any holder of
Certificates, (y) upon demand by the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent
shall sell, on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, any remaining Parent
Ordinary Shares issued to it pursuant to Section 3.1(f) and not otherwise
distributed to holders of Common Shares entitled thereto, such sales to be
executed on the LSE and (z) the proceeds thereof, together with any remaining
cash representing unpaid Preferred Merger Consideration, shall be remitted to
the Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable thereafter.

                                       A-12
<PAGE>

     (f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.  In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Common Merger Consideration or the Preferred Merger
Consideration, as applicable, and any cash payable in lieu of a fraction of a
Parent Ordinary Share or Parent Depositary Share, as the case may be, and any
unpaid dividends or other distributions in respect thereof pursuant to Section
3.2(b) and Section 3.2(d) upon due surrender of, and deliverable in respect of
the Common Shares or Preferred Shares represented by, such Certificate pursuant
to this Agreement. Delivery of such affidavit and the posting of such bond shall
be deemed delivery of a Certificate with respect to the relevant Common Shares
or Preferred Shares for purposes of this Article III.

     (g) Withholding Taxes.  Subject to Section 3.1(c), Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the Common Merger Consideration or Preferred Merger Consideration or other
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of
Common Shares or Preferred Shares such amounts as Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former
holder of the Common Shares or Preferred Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent.

     3.3 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution.  In the event Parent changes (or
establishes a record date for changing) the number of Parent Ordinary Shares
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split,
stock dividend (other than issuances of stock scrip in lieu of cash dividends
consistent with past practice), recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction with respect to the
outstanding Parent Ordinary Shares then (a) if the record and payment or
effective dates, as the case may be, therefor shall be at or prior to the
Effective Time, the Common Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted to
reflect such stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction; and
(b) if the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time but the
payment or effective date, as the case may be, therefor shall be subsequent to
the Effective Time, Parent shall take such action as shall be required so that
on such payment or effective date, as the case may be, any former holder of
Common Shares who shall have received or become entitled to receive Common
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article III shall be entitled to receive
such additional Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent Depositary Shares, as the case
may be, as such holder would have received as a result of such event if the
record date therefor had been immediately after the Effective Time. Appropriate
adjustments shall also be made in the event the number of Parent Ordinary Shares
represented by each Parent Depositary Share is changed. In the event that,
notwithstanding Section 7.1(a) hereof, the Company changes (or establishes a
record date for changing) the number of Common Shares or Preferred Shares of any
series issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock
split, stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction with respect to the
outstanding Common Shares or such series of Preferred Shares, then the Common
Exchange Ratio or the Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable, shall be
appropriately adjusted, taking into account the record and payment or effective
dates, as the case may be, for such transaction.

     3.4 Options and Other Equity-Based Awards.

        (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent
and the Company (or, if appropriate, the Board of Directors of the Company or
Parent or any committee of the Board of Directors of the Company administering
the Company's 1996 Long Term Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the "1996
Plan"), the Company's Long Term Executive Incentive Compensation Plan and
Beneficial Corporation 1990 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, the Beneficial
Corporation Benshares Equity Participation Plan and the Renaissance Amended and
Restated 1997 Incentive Plan, each as amended (collectively, the "Company Option
Plans")) shall take such action as may be required or desirable (including
obtaining all applicable

                                       A-13
<PAGE>

consents) to effect the following provisions of this Section 3.4(a). Effective
as of the Effective Time, each then outstanding option to purchase Common Shares
(each a "Company Stock Option") granted pursuant to the Company Option Plans or
otherwise granted by the Company to any current or former employee or director
of, or consultant to, the Company or any of its subsidiaries (each, an "Option
Holder") shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into an option (an
"Assumed Stock Option") to purchase a number of Parent Ordinary Shares (rounded
to the nearest whole share) equal to (x) the number of Common Shares subject to
such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
(y) the Common Exchange Ratio; and the per share exercise price for Parent
Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Stock Option shall be
equal to (1) the exercise price per Common Share at which such Company Stock
Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (2)
the Common Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole cent); provided,
however, that in the case of any Company Stock Option to which Section 421 of
the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code,
the conversion formula shall be adjusted, if necessary, to comply with Section
424(a) of the Code. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Assumed Stock
Option shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including expiration
date, vesting and exercise provisions) as were applicable to the corresponding
Company Stock Options immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided,
further, that the Board of Directors of Parent or a committee thereof shall
succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Board of Directors of the
Company or any committee thereof. At or prior to the time an option holder
exercises his or her Assumed Stock Option, such option holder may elect to
receive, in lieu of the Parent Ordinary Shares underlying such Assumed Stock
Option, a number of Parent Depositary Shares (if any) determined using the
conversion ratio of Parent Ordinary Shares to Parent Depositary Shares, as in
effect at that time pursuant to the Deposit Agreement.

     (b) With respect to Company Stock Options granted under the Company Option
Plans pursuant to which consent of an Option Holder is required under the terms
of the applicable Company Option Plan, if any, as identified in Section 3.2(b)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no later than the Effective Time, the
Company will obtain a signed written consent from each Option Holder to the
treatment of the Company Stock Options in the manner described in Section 3.4(a)
hereof. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to
the Option Holders appropriate notices setting forth the number of Parent
Ordinary Shares subject to such Assumed Stock Options held by each such Option
Holder and the exercise price under each such Assumed Stock Option, each as
adjusted pursuant to Section 3.4(a) hereof, and stating that such Assumed Stock
Options shall remain subject to the original terms and conditions applicable to
the corresponding Company Stock Option as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (subject to the adjustments required by Section 3.4(a)).

     (c) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued,
to receive Common Shares or benefits measured by the value of a number of Common
Shares, and each award of any kind consisting of shares of Common Shares,
granted under the Company Option Plans or any other Company Benefit Plan
(including restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock units and
dividend equivalents), other than Company Stock Options (each, a "Company
Stock-Based Award"), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall cease to represent a right or
award with respect to Common Shares and shall be converted, at the Effective
Time, into a right or award with respect to Parent Ordinary Shares (an "Assumed
Stock-Based Award"), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under
the Company Stock-Based Awards (but taking into account any changes thereto,
including the acceleration thereof, provided for in the Company Option Plans or
other Company Benefit Plan or in any award agreement thereunder by reason of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby). The number of shares of
Parent Ordinary Shares subject to each such Assumed Stock-Based Award shall be
equal to the number of Common Shares subject to the Company Stock-Based Award,
multiplied by the Common Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole Parent
Ordinary Share). All dividend equivalents credited to the account of each holder
of a Company Stock-Based Award as of the Effective Time shall remain credited to
such holder's account immediately following the Effective Time, subject to
adjustment in accordance with the foregoing. At or prior to the time a holder of
an Assumed Stock-Based Award is entitled to distribution of Parent Ordinary
Shares in respect of such Award, such holder may elect to receive, in lieu of
the Parent Ordinary Shares underlying such Assumed Stock-Based Award, a number
of Parent Depositary Shares (if

                                       A-14
<PAGE>

any) determined using the conversion ratio of Parent Ordinary Shares to Parent
Depositary Shares, as in effect at that time pursuant to the Deposit Agreement.

     (d) Within 10 Business Days after the Effective Time, (i) Parent shall take
such actions as are reasonably necessary to reserve for issuance or procure the
purchase of a sufficient number of Parent Ordinary Shares and Parent Depositary
Shares upon the exercise of the Assumed Stock Options and settlement or
distribution of the Assumed Stock-Based Awards and (ii) Parent shall use its
best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on an
appropriate form or a post-effective amendment to a previously filed
registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the issuance of
the Parent Ordinary Shares and Parent Depositary Shares subject to the Assumed
Stock Options and Assumed Stock-Based Awards.

     (e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary or
appropriate action (including amending any of the Company Option Plans or other
Company Benefit Plans and related award agreements or making adjustments as
permitted thereby) to effectuate the assumption and conversion of the Company
Stock Options and Company-Stock-Based Awards by Parent in accordance with the
terms hereof and the assignment to Parent of the authorities and
responsibilities of the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof under the Company Option Plans or other Company Benefit Plans.

     (f) The Company shall take such action as is necessary to (i) cause the
exercise (as of a date that is no later than three Business Days prior to the
Effective Date) of each outstanding purchase right under the Company Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the "Company ESPP"); and (ii) provide that no further
purchase period shall commence under the Company ESPP following such date;
provided, however, that such exercise and cessation of further purchase periods
shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. On such new exercise
date, the Company shall apply the funds credited as of such date under the
Company ESPP within each participant's payroll withholding account to the
purchase of whole shares of Common Shares in accordance with the terms of the
Company ESPP. In addition, the Company shall take such action as is necessary to
provide that (as of a date that is no later than three Business Days prior to
the Effective Date) no further Common Shares will be purchased under the Company
Dividend Reinvestment and Common Stock Purchase Plan (the "Company DRIP" and,
together with the Company ESPP, the "Company Stock Purchase Plans"); provided,
however, that such cessation of further purchases shall be conditioned upon the
consummation of the Merger. At the Effective Time, a holder of Common Shares
received under the Company Stock Purchase Plans shall, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of such holder, be entitled to receive the
Common Merger Consideration (subject to any applicable withholding tax as
specified in Section 3.2(g) hereof or as may apply to payments made in
connection with the performance of services), upon the surrender of the
certificate representing such Common Shares as provided in Section 3.2.
Immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time and subject to the
consummation of the Merger, the Company shall terminate the Company Stock
Purchase Plans.

     3.5 Shares of Dissenting Shareholders.  Any holder of Preferred Shares who
perfects such holder's dissenters' rights of appraisal in accordance with and as
contemplated by Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares, "Dissenting Shares") shall
be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation the value of such shares
in cash as determined pursuant to such statute; provided, however, that no such
payment shall be made to any dissenting stockholder unless and until such
dissenting stockholder has complied with the applicable provisions of the DGCL
and surrendered to the Surviving Corporation the certificate or certificates
representing the Preferred Shares for which payment is being made. In the event
that after the Effective Time a dissenting holder of Preferred Shares fails to
perfect, or effectively withdraws or loses, such holder's right to appraisal of
and payment for such holder's shares, the Surviving Corporation shall issue and
deliver the Preferred Merger Consideration to which such holder of Preferred
Shares is entitled under this Article III (without interest) upon surrender by
such holder of the Certificate or Certificates representing Preferred Shares
held by such holder.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     4.1 Disclosure Schedules.  Prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Company has delivered to Parent, and Parent has delivered to the
Company, a schedule (in the case of the Company, the "Company Disclosure
Schedule," and, in the case of Parent, the "Parent Disclosure Schedule") setting
forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or
appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in
a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more specified representations
or warranties contained in Article V, in the case of the Company, or Article VI,
in the case of Parent, or to one or more of such party's covenants contained in
Article VII; provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, (i) no such item is required to be set forth in the relevant
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty if its
absence would not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed
untrue or incorrect under the standard established by Section 4.2, and (ii) the
mere inclusion of an item in either the Company Disclosure Schedule or the
Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall
not be deemed an admission by the disclosing party that such item represents a
material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has
had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to either the Company or Parent, as the case may be.

     4.2 Standards.  No representation or warranty of the Company contained in
Article V (other than (i) Section 5.3(a), which shall be deemed untrue and
incorrect if not true and correct in all but de minimis respects and (ii)
Section 5.3(b), 5.3(c), 5.6(c) and 5.11(c), which shall be deemed untrue and
incorrect if not true and correct in all material respects) or of Parent
contained in Article VI (other than Sections 6.2(a) and 6.2(b), which shall be
deemed untrue or incorrect if not true and correct in all material respects)
shall be deemed untrue or incorrect for any purpose under this Agreement, and no
party hereto shall be deemed to have breached a representation or warranty for
any purpose under this Agreement, in any case as a consequence of the existence
or absence of any fact, circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance or
event, individually or when taken together with all other facts, circumstances
or events inconsistent with any representations or warranties contained in
Article V, in the case of the Company, or Article VI, in the case of Parent, has
had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect
to the Company or Parent, respectively (disregarding for purposes of this
Section 4.2 any materiality qualification contained in any representations or
warranties).

Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any outstanding bonds, debentures, notes
or other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible
into or exchangeable for securities having the right to vote) with the
shareholders of any of the Company's subsidiaries on any matter. To the

of its subsidiaries, (viii) all collective bargaining agreements, (ix) any

                                       A-19

employment agreement or any agreement or arrangement that contains any material
severance pay or post-employment liabilities or obligations to any current or
former employee of the Company or its subsidiaries, other than as required under
applicable law, (x) any agreement regarding any agent bank or other similar
relationship with respect to lines of business, (xi) any material agreement that
contains a "most favored nation" clause, (xii) any material agreement set forth
in Section 5.22(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (xiii) any Servicing
Agreement, and (xiv) any other contract or other agreement not made in the
ordinary course of business which is material to the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or which would reasonably be expected to
materially delay the consummation of the Merger or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (each a "Company Material Contract").

     (b) Each Company Material Contract is valid and binding on the Company (or,
to the extent a subsidiary of the Company is a party, such subsidiary) and, to
the knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto, and is in full force and
effect. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge
of the Company, any other party to any Company Material Contract, is in default
in any material respect as to any provision thereof, and no such Company
Material Contract contains any provision providing that the other party thereto
may terminate such Company Material Contract, or alter the terms thereof, by
reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date
hereof, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received any notice
to the effect that the financial condition of any other party to any Company
Material Contract is impaired so that a default thereunder or other failure to
comply with the terms thereof may reasonably be anticipated, whether or not such
default or non-compliance may be cured by the operation of any offset clause in
such Company Material Contract.

     (c) No consents with respect to any Company Material Contracts are required
to be obtained in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby that, as of the Closing, will have not been
obtained, except where the failure to obtain such consents would not be material
to the Company.

acquired, as the case may be, in accordance with the Company's written policies
regarding such matters as in effect at the time of such origination,

installment contract or retail installment contract related to the Company Loans
constitutes a valid, legal and binding obligation of the obligor thereunder,
enforceable against such obligor in accordance with the terms thereof (except as
enforcement may be limited by general principles of equity whether applied in a
court of law or a court of equity and by bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws
affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally). The Company has kept
complete and accurate books and records in connection with the Company Loans,
and there are no oral modifications or amendments related to the Company Loans
that are not reflected in the Company's records, no defenses as to the
enforcement of any Company Loan have been asserted, and there have been no acts

subsidiary (i) is obligated to make reimbursable temporary advances of
delinquent mortgage interest or (ii) holds a residual or subordinate interest in
any securitization that may experience reduced payments as a result of such
losses (which advance obligations and interests as of the date hereof have been

        (c) The Company and each of its subsidiaries have complied with all
obligations under all applicable insurance contracts, including any mortgage
policy, and any pool insurance with respect to, and have not taken or failed to
take any action which might materially and adversely affect, the Company Loans
or any of the Company Servicing Rights.

        (d) During the five-year period prior to the date hereof, with respect
to any loan that is serviced by any of the Company or any of its subsidiary, if
the applicable Servicing Agreement obligated the Company or such subsidiary, as
the case may be, to maintain escrow funds for the payment of taxes, insurance or
similar items with respect to the loan, all required escrow accounts maintained
by the Company or such subsidiary, as the case may be, have been created and
administered in all material respects in accordance with the related mortgage
loan documents, applicable law and the applicable Servicing Agreement and all

other Person, currently is in default with regard to any agreement relating to

                                       A-34
<PAGE>

Parent SEC Documents when filed (as amended and restated and as supplemented by
subsequently filed Parent SEC Documents) contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The financial
statements of the Parent and its subsidiaries included in the Parent SEC
Documents (collectively, the "Parent Financial Statements") complied as to form,
as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects
with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally

and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position
of the Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended.

     6.6 Undisclosed Liabilities.  Except as set forth in Section 6.6(a) of the

Agreement or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

     6.7 Information Supplied.  None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by the Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation

F-4 becomes effective under the Securities Act, or at the date the Proxy
Statement is first mailed to the Company's shareholders or at the date of the
Company Shareholder Meeting, as applicable, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however,
that no representation or warranty is made by the Parent with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement, as applicable.

     6.8 Absence of Certain Changes or Events.  Except for liabilities incurred
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or as

decree applicable to Parent or any of its subsidiaries or by which its or any of
their respective properties is bound or affected or (ii) any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or
other instrument or obligation to which Parent or any of its subsidiaries is a
party or by which Parent or any of its subsidiaries or its or any of their
respective properties is bound or affected. No such conflicts, defaults or
violations (whether or not disclosed in Section 6.9(a) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule) have had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent.

        (b) Except as set forth in Section 6.9(b) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule or in the Parent SEC Documents, no investigation by any Governmental
Entity with respect to Parent or any of its subsidiaries is pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened.

     6.10 Absence of Litigation.  There are no claims, actions, suits,
proceedings or investigations pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened

Effect on Parent.

action or knows of any fact that is reasonably likely to (i) jeopardize the
qualification of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368 of the Code or (ii) cause the shareholders of the Company, other than any
such shareholder that would be a "five-percent transferee shareholder" of Parent
(within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5))
following the Merger, to recognize gain pursuant to Section 367(a) of the Code.
Parent is not aware of any facts or circumstances relating to Parent or any of
its subsidiaries, including any covenants or undertakings of Parent pursuant to
this Agreement, that would prevent Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton from
delivering the Parent Counsel Tax Opinion, or prevent Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &
Katz from delivering the Company Counsel Tax Opinion.

     6.13 Voting Matters.  The approval (the "Parent Shareholder Approval") of
the resolutions set forth in Section 8.2, on a show of hands, or, on a poll by
not less than the holders of a majority of the outstanding Parent Ordinary
Shares who vote in Person or by proxy at the Parent Shareholder Meeting, is the
only vote of the holders of any class or series of the Parent's capital stock
necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger.

banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained
representative) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall directly or

furnishing information) or take any other action designed to facilitate any
inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale
of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including, without limitation, by
way of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving the Company or any of

Transaction (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals being referred to
herein as an "Acquisition Proposal"), (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding an Alternative Transaction or (iii) enter into any
agreement regarding any Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Board of Directors of the Company shall be permitted, prior to the Company
Shareholder Meeting and subject to compliance with the other terms of this
Section 7.2, to consider and participate in discussions and negotiations with
respect to a bona fide Acquisition Proposal received by the Company that the
Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith (after consulting with
a nationally recognized investment banking firm) would, if accepted, be
reasonably capable of being consummated and would, if consummated, constitute a
Superior Proposal not solicited in violation of this Agreement, if and only to
the extent that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.

           (b) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later
than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any material
modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or any
request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of the Company or
any subsidiary by any Person or entity that informs the Board of Directors of
the Company or any subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to Parent shall be made orally and in writing,
and shall indicate the identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal or
intending to make or considering making an Acquisition Proposal or requesting
non-public information or access to the books and records of the Company or any
subsidiary, and the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or
modification or amendment to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall keep
Parent fully informed, on a current basis, of any material changes in the status
and any material changes or modifications in the terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall also promptly, and in any
event within twenty-four hours, notify Parent, orally and in writing, if it
enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal in
accordance with Section 7.2(a).

           (c) Neither the Company nor the Board of Directors of the Company
(nor any committee thereof) shall, in a manner adverse to Parent, (i) withdraw,
modify or qualify, or propose to withdraw, modify or qualify, the recommendation
by such Board of Directors of this Agreement and/or the Merger to the Company's
shareholders, (ii) take any action or make any statement in connection with the
Company Shareholder Meeting inconsistent with such approval (any action referred
to in clause (i)or (ii) being a "Change in Company Recommendation") or (iii)
recommend any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall be permitted to take the actions described in
clauses (i) through (iii) above if the Company has complied in all material
respects with Sections 7.2(a), 7.2(b) and 7.2(e), if and to the extent the Board
of Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good faith (after due
consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties; provided, however, that the Company
shall have provided Parent three Business Days' prior written

                                       A-39
<PAGE>

notice to the effect that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to take
such action and the reasons therefor.

        (d) Nothing contained in this Section 7.2 shall prohibit the Company or
its subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

        (e) The Company and its subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause
to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons
(other than Parent) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing,
and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons other than Parent who
have been furnished confidential information regarding the Company in connection
with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal within
the 12 months prior to the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such
information. The Company agrees not to, and to cause its subsidiaries not to,
release any third party from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of
any agreement to which the Company or its subsidiaries is a party, and shall
immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval which may have
been heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any person to make
an Acquisition Proposal.

        (f) The Company shall ensure that the officers, directors and all
employees, agents and representatives (including any investment bankers,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other retained representatives) of
the Company or its subsidiaries are aware of the restrictions described in this
Section 7.2 as reasonably necessary to avoid violations thereof. It is
understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.2
by any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained
representative) of the Company or its subsidiaries, at the direction or with the
consent of the Company or its subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Section 7.2 by the Company.

     7.3 Conduct of Business by Parent Pending the Merger.  Except as (i) set
forth in Section 7.3 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, (ii) otherwise expressly
contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) consented to by the Company in writing,
during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Parent
covenants and agrees that Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its
subsidiaries to:

        (a) other than Parent's Final Dividend payable on dates consistent with
past practice (including as to payment of scrip dividend), (i) declare, set
aside or pay any dividends on, make any other distributions (whether in cash,
stock, property or any combination thereof) in respect of the capital stock of
Parent or (ii) split, combine or reclassify any of the capital stock of Parent
or issue or authorize or propose the issuance of any other securities in respect
of, in lieu of, or in substitution for, shares of the capital stock of Parent;

        (b) acquire or agree to acquire (by merger, consolidation, acquisition
of assets, acquisition of stock or by any other manner) any corporation,
partnership or other business organization or any division thereof, unless such
action would not reasonably be expected to delay or impede the consummation of
the Merger; or

        (c) amend or otherwise change the memorandum of association or articles
of association (or equivalent organizational documents) of Parent or any
subsidiary of Parent in a manner that would materially delay or impede the
transactions contemplated hereby or be adverse to the holders of the Company's
capital stock, giving effect to the Merger.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                             ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

     8.1 Registration Statement; Parent Documents.  (a) Each of Parent and the
Company, as applicable, shall as promptly as practicable prepare (i) a
Registration Statement on Form F-4 (the "Form F-4") under the Securities Act,
with respect to the issuance of the Parent Depositary Shares and the Parent ADRs
and Parent Ordinary Shares in the Merger, a portion of which Form F-4 shall also
serve as the Company's proxy statement (the "Proxy Statement") and the
prospectus (the "Prospectus") with respect to the Parent Ordinary Shares and
Parent Depositary Shares issuable in the Merger, and (ii) the Parent Documents.
Parent shall file with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof the Form F-4. The parties will

                                       A-40
<PAGE>

cause the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement to comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act. Parent shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to have the Form
F-4 declared effective by the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after
such filing. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, prior to
the effective date of the Form F-4, all necessary state securities law or "Blue
Sky" permits or approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (but in no event shall Parent in connection with its obligations
pursuant to this Section 8.1(a) be obligated to qualify to do business in any
state or other jurisdiction or to file a general consent to service of process
or consent to jurisdiction in any state or other jurisdiction). No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement will be made by
Parent or the Company without providing the other with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment thereon. Parent will advise the Company, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form F-4 has become effective or
any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the
suspension of the qualification of the Parent Depositary Shares or Parent
Ordinary Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Form F-4 or
comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information. The Company will advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or
comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information.

        (b) Parent will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Circular
to be mailed to its shareholders as soon as possible following the effectiveness
of the Form F-4. The Company will use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Company Proxy Statement and, to the extent required, a summary of the Parent
Listing Particulars to be mailed to its shareholders as soon as possible
following the effectiveness of the Form F-4.

        (c) The Company and Parent shall cooperate and Parent shall reasonably
promptly prepare and file with the UKLA, the HKSE and Euronext Paris, a circular
to be sent to Parent shareholders in connection with the Parent Shareholder
Meeting (the "Parent Circular"), containing (i) a notice convening the Parent
Shareholder Meeting, (ii) such other information (if any) as may be required by
the UKLA, the HKSE or Euronext Paris, and (iii) such other information as Parent
reasonably determines to include therein. The Company and Parent shall cooperate
and Parent shall also prepare and file with the UKLA listing particulars and, if
required, supplementary listing particulars, or, if required, prepare and file
with the HKSE and/or Euronext Paris any listing document required by the HKSE
and/or Euronext Paris, relating to Parent and its subsidiaries and the Parent
Ordinary Shares (the "Parent Listing Particulars" and, together with the Parent
Circular, the "Parent Documents"). Each of the Company (solely to the extent
such information is provided by the Company for inclusion therein) and Parent
agrees that the Parent Documents and any supplements thereto and any other
circulars or documents issued to shareholders, employees or debentureholders of
Parent, will contain all particulars required to comply in all respects with all
applicable United Kingdom and Hong Kong statutory and other legal and regulatory
provisions (including, without limitation, the Companies Act 1985, the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000, the Companies Ordinance (Chapter 32 of the Laws
of Hong Kong) and the rules and regulations made thereunder, and the rules and
requirements of the UKLA and the HKSE) and all other applicable legal and
regulatory provisions and all such information contained in such documents will
be in accordance with the facts and will not omit anything material likely to
affect the import of such information or would make any statement therein
misleading. The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as practicable of any
alterations in the information provided by it for the purposes of this Section
8.1(c) resulting in any statement in the Parent Documents containing an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitting a material fact which renders such
statement misleading and the Company shall cooperate with Parent in the
provision of new information relating to it and in the preparation of resulting
supplementary documents required by the UKLA or the HKSE.

     8.2 Shareholder Meetings.  (a) The Company will take all action reasonably
necessary to convene a meeting of the holders of Company Common Stock (the
"Company Shareholder Meeting"), at which such holders shall consider of the
approval of the agreement of merger contained herein as promptly as reasonably
practicable (subject to applicable law and to this Section 8.2) after the Form
F-4 has been declared effective by the SEC. Parent will take all action
reasonably necessary to convene an extraordinary general meeting of

                                       A-41
<PAGE>

Parent's shareholders (the "Parent Shareholder Meeting"), as promptly as
reasonably practicable (subject to applicable law and to this Section 8.2) after
the Parent Circular has been approved by the UKLA and HKSE, at which such
holders shall consider one or more resolutions to, inter alia, (A) approve the
agreement of merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (B)
authorize the issue of Parent Ordinary Shares and allotment of relevant
securities, including in connection with the continued operation of the Company
Stock Plans and the exercise of rights pursuant to the Units and other
derivative instruments of the Company. The Company's obligations under this
Section 8.2(a) shall not be affected by any determination of the Company's Board
of Directors not to recommend the Merger or to no longer deem it advisable.

        (b) Parent and the Company shall each use reasonable best efforts such
that, to the extent reasonably practicable, the Company Shareholder Meeting and
the Parent Shareholder Meeting shall be held on the same day and as promptly as
reasonably practicable (subject to applicable law) after the conditions
precedent to holding such meetings have been fulfilled. Subject to the
requirements of applicable law and the terms of this Agreement (including, in
the case of Parent, the fiduciary duties of its board of directors under
applicable law and, in the case of the Company, the provisions of Section 7.2),
the board of directors of each of Parent and the Company shall recommend to its
respective shareholders the approval of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit such
approval.

     8.3 Access to Information; Confidentiality.  Subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated October 11, 2002 between Parent and the Company (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), and subject to the restrictions contained in
confidentiality agreements to which the Company and its subsidiaries are subject
(which restrictions the Company and its subsidiaries will use its reasonable
best efforts to have waived) and applicable law, Company shall, and shall cause
each of its subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives of Parent,
reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Effective Time to all their respective properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records and, during such period, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent (i) a
copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed
by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities laws and (ii) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request. In
addition, the Company will deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Parent the
internal or external reports reasonably required by Parent promptly after such
reports are made available to the Company's personnel. Parent will hold, and
will cause its respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial
advisors and other representatives and affiliates to hold, any nonpublic
information in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

     8.4 Filings; Other Actions; Notification.  (a) Subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each
other and use (and shall cause their respective subsidiaries to use) reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be
done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement
and applicable laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable,
including preparing and filing as promptly as reasonably practicable all
documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports, applications and other
filings and to obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable all consents,
registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to
be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to
consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including, without limitation, the Government Consents); provided,
however, that nothing in this Section 8.4 shall require, or be construed to
require, Parent, in connection with the receipt of any regulatory approval, to
proffer to, or agree (or for Parent to permit the Company to proffer to or to
agree) to (i) sell or hold separate or agree to sell, divest, discontinue or
limit, before or after the Effective Time, any assets, businesses, or interest
in any assets or businesses of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
affiliates (or to consent to any discontinuance or limitation by Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, of any of its assets or businesses) or (ii) agree
to any conditions relating to, or changes or restriction in, the operations of
any such asset or businesses which, in the case of either clause (i) or (ii), is
reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent or the Company or a material adverse effect on the Parent
Intermediate Holding Subsidiary (consolidated with

                                       A-42
<PAGE>

its subsidiaries) (any such requirement, a "Burdensome Condition"). Subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent shall have the
right to review in advance any material filing made with, or written materials
submitted by the Company to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, Parent shall act reasonably and as
promptly as reasonably practicable.

        (b) The Company and Parent each shall, upon reasonable request by the
other and subject to applicable law, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Company Proxy Statement, the Form F-4, the Parent Documents, the Press
Announcements or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or
on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries to any
third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall procure that
William F. Aldinger, as a proposed director of Parent, will take responsibility
for the Parent Documents to the extent required by the UKLA, the HKSE and
Euronext Paris.

        (c)  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company and
Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of material notices or other
communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any of
its subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The Company and Parent each shall give prompt notice to the other of any change
that, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or to cause the non-satisfaction of
any condition to the Merger.

        (d) In the event any claim, action, suit, investigation or other
proceeding by any Governmental Entity or other Person or other legal or
administrative proceeding is commenced that questions the validity or legality
of this Agreement, or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or claims damages in connection therewith, the Company and Parent each
agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts, subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 8.4(a), to defend against and respond thereto.

     8.5 Accountants' Letters.  Each of the Company and Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to the other party, (i) a
letter of KPMG LLP and KPMG Audit plc, respectively, independent auditors, dated
(A) the date on which the Form F-4 shall become effective and (B) a date shortly
prior to the Effective Date, and addressed to such other party, in form and
substance customary for "comfort" letters delivered by independent accountants
in accordance with Statement of Accounting Standards No. 72 and (ii) letters of
KPMG LLP and KPMG Audit plc dated (A) the date on which the Parent Documents are
sent to shareholders or, in the case of the Parent Listing Particulars, approved
by the UKLA and (B) (if the parties so determine) a date shortly prior to the
Effective Date and addressed to the other party and, in the case of Parent, to
its sponsor pursuant to the Listing Rules of the UKLA, in relation to the
financial and other information to be included in the Parent Documents, in form
and substance customary for comfort letters in relation to such documents.

     8.6 Listing Applications.  Parent shall promptly prepare and submit to the
UKLA, the HKSE and Euronext Paris a listing application and to the LSE an
application for admission to trading with respect to the Parent Ordinary Shares,
and to the NYSE a listing application in respect of the Parent Ordinary Shares
and Parent Depositary Shares issuable in the Merger or, as necessary, upon
exercise of Assumed Options, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain, prior to the Effective Time, approval for the listing of such Parent
Ordinary Shares, in the case of the UKLA, the HKSE, Euronext Paris and the LSE,
and such Parent Ordinary Shares and Parent Depositary Shares in the case of the
NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. The Surviving Corporation shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Common Shares to be de-listed from
the NYSE and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time.

     8.7 Tax Opinions.  Each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each
other in obtaining the opinions of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, counsel
to Parent (the "Parent Counsel Tax Opinion"), and

                                       A-43
<PAGE>

Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, counsel to the Company (the "Company Counsel Tax
Opinion"), each dated the Closing Date, to the effect that (i) the Merger will
be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) each transfer of property to
Parent by a shareholder of the Company pursuant to the Merger will not be
subject to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code. In rendering the Parent Counsel Tax
Opinion and the Company Counsel Tax Opinion, Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton
and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, respectively, may rely upon and require such
certificates of the Company and Parent and/or their officers or principal
shareholders as are customary for such opinions. Each opinion may assume that
any shareholder who is a "five-percent transferee shareholder" with respect to
Parent within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-
3(c)(5)(ii) will file the agreement described in U.S. Treasury Regulations
Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(1)(iii)(B).

     8.8 Affiliates.  Not later than the fifteenth day prior to the mailing of
the Proxy Statement, the Company shall deliver to Parent a list of names and
addresses of those Persons who are or are expected to be, to the knowledge of
the Company, as of the time of the Company Shareholder Meeting, "affiliates" of
the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. There shall
be added to such lists the names and addresses of any other Person subsequently
identified by the Company as a Person who may be deemed to be such an affiliate;
provided, however, that no such Person identified by the Company shall remain on
such list of affiliates if Parent shall receive from the Company, on or before
the date of the Company Shareholder Meeting, an opinion of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Parent to the effect that such Person is not such an affiliate.
The Company shall exercise its reasonable best efforts to deliver or cause to be
delivered to Parent, prior to the date of the Company Shareholder Meeting, from
each such affiliate identified in the list delivered pursuant to the first
sentence of this Section 8.8 (as the same may be supplemented as aforesaid) a
letter dated as of the Company Shareholder Meeting in a form to be mutually
agreed by Parent and the Company (the "Affiliate Letters"). Parent shall not be
required to maintain the effectiveness of the Form F-4 or any other registration
statement under the Securities Act for the purposes of resale of Parent Ordinary
Shares or Parent Depositary Shares received in the Merger by such affiliates and
the Parent ADRs representing Parent Depositary Shares received by such
affiliates shall bear a customary legend regarding applicable Securities Act
restrictions and the provisions of this Section 8.8.

     8.9 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.  (a) Parent agrees that all
rights to indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation from liabilities
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing
in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and its
subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or
by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification
agreements or arrangements of the Company listed in Section 5.18 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms. The Surviving Corporation shall
cooperate in the defense of any such matter. From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL and other applicable laws,
the present and former officers and directors of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries in their capacities as such against all losses, expenses, claims,
damages or liabilities arising out of actions or omissions occurring on or prior
to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, actions or omissions
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby).

        (b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will assume the
obligations thereof set forth in this Section 8.9.

        (c) The provisions of this Section 8.9 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person
may have by contract or otherwise.

                                       A-44
<PAGE>

        (d) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain in effect the Company's current directors' and officers'
liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time with respect to those Persons who are currently covered by the Company's
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy on terms with respect to
such coverage and amount no less favorable to the Company's directors and
officers currently covered by such insurance than those of such policy in effect
on the date hereof; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation may
substitute therefor policies of Parent or its subsidiaries containing terms with
respect to coverage and amount no less favorable to such directors or officers;
provided, further, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required
to pay aggregate premiums for insurance under this Section 8.9(d) in excess of
250% of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company as of the date hereof on an
annualized basis for such purpose; provided, further, that in the event the
Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain such insurance it shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance coverage as is
available for the maximum premium indicated above.

        (e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any successor
thereto to comply with its obligations under this Section 8.9.

     8.10 Employee Matters.  (a) For the one year period ending on the first
anniversary of the Effective Date (the "Continuation Period"), Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries to, (i) pay to the
employees of the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries, during any portion
of the Continuation Period that such employee is employed by the Surviving
Corporation or any such subsidiary, an annual salary or hourly wage rate and
bonus and annual incentives (other than equity-based awards), as applicable,
that are no less than the annual salary or hourly wage rate and bonus and annual
incentives (other than equity-based awards) payable to such employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide such employees in the aggregate
with employee benefits, during any portion of the Continuation Period that such
employees are employed by the Surviving Corporation or any such subsidiary, that
are substantially similar in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to
such employees pursuant to the Company Benefit Plans (other than equity-based
benefits) immediately prior to the Effective Time, except with regard to
employees covered by employment agreement with the Company, effective as of the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, none of the Parent,
the Surviving Corporation nor any of its subsidiaries will have any obligation
to continue the employment of any such employee for any period following the
Effective Time.

        (b) With respect to employee benefit plans, if any, of Parent or its
subsidiaries in which employees of the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries
("Company Employees") become eligible to participate after the Effective Time
(the "Parent Plans"), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or
its subsidiaries to: (i) with respect to each Parent Plan that is a medical or
health plan, (x) waive any exclusions for pre-existing conditions under such
Parent Plan that would result in a lack of coverage for any condition for which
the applicable Company Employee would have been entitled to coverage under the
corresponding Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee was an active
participant immediately prior to his or her transfer to the Parent Plan; (y)
waive any waiting period under such Parent Plan, to the extent that such period
exceeds the corresponding waiting period under the corresponding Company Benefit
Plan in which such Company Employee was an active participant immediately prior
to his or her transfer to the Parent Plan (after taking into account the service
credit provided for herein for purposes of satisfying such waiting period); and
(z) provide each Company Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid by such Company Employee prior to his or her transfer to the
Parent Plan (to the same extent such credit was given under the analogous
Company Benefit Plan prior to such transfer) in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under such Parent Plan for the plan
year that includes such transfer; and (ii) recognize service of the Company
Employees with the Company or any of its subsidiaries (or their respective
predecessors) for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting credit,
and, solely with respect to vacation and severance benefits, benefit accrual in
any Parent Plan in which the Company Employees are eligible to participate after
the Effective Time, to the extent that such service was recognized for that
purpose under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to such transfer;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would
result in duplication of benefits. Nothing in this paragraph shall be
interpreted to require Parent to provide for the participation of any Company
Employee in any Parent Plan.

                                       A-45
<PAGE>

        (c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor the Employment
Agreements, Employment Protection Agreements and Severance Plans (subject to the
right of the Surviving Corporation to amend and/or terminate such plan pursuant
to the terms thereof) set forth in Section 8.10(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

        (d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor the accrued
benefits under each of the Company's non-qualified deferred compensation and
retirement plans. The Company shall take such action as may be necessary so that
it will not be required to fund or otherwise set aside any cash or other assets
to provide for any employee benefits as a result of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein.

        (e) The Company and Parent agree to the terms and conditions set forth
on Exhibit 8.10(e) with respect to certain employee benefits matters.

     8.11 Section 16 Matters.  Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions
of Common Shares (including derivative securities with respect to Common Shares)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

     8.12 Public Announcements.  Parent and the Company will consult with each
other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review, comment
upon and concur with, and use reasonable efforts to agree on, any press release
or other public statements and any internal communications with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may issue or make,
directly or indirectly, any report, statement or release required by applicable
law, its fiduciary obligations or any listing agreement or arrangement with a
national securities exchange or national market system (including, without
limitation, the NYSE, the LSE, the HKSE and Euronext Paris) to which such party
is subject, if the other party has, to the extent practicable, been notified and
given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the report, statement or
release.

     8.13 Conveyance Taxes.  Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
or other documents regarding any sales, use, value added, transfer, recording,
registration and other fees or any similar taxes which become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are
required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective Time. Subject to
Section 3.2(a)(iii), the Company shall pay, without deduction or withholding
from any amount payable to the holders of Company Common Stock, any such taxes
or fees imposed by any Governmental Entity which become payable in connection
with Merger or the payment of the Common Merger Consideration and the Preferred
Merger Consideration for which the Company is primarily liable and in no event
shall Parent pay such amounts.

     8.14 Tax Free Merger.  Parent and the Company will use their respective
reasonable best efforts, and agree to cooperate with the other parties and
provide one another with such documentation, information and materials as may be
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable, to (i) cause the Merger to qualify as
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) avoid
gain recognition to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Section
367(a)(i) of the Code. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall comply with

          (i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated by June 30, 2003;
     provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

within 30 days following written notice to the party committing such breach, or
which breach, by its nature or timing, cannot reasonably be cured within such

Ladies and Gentlemen:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view
to the holders of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, par value $1 per share
(the "Shares"), of Household International, Inc. (the "Company") of the exchange
ratio of 2.675 ordinary shares, nominal value US$0.50 each (the "HSBC Ordinary
Shares"), of HSBC Holdings plc ("HSBC") to be received for each Share (the
"Exchange Ratio") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
November 14, 2002 (the "Agreement"), by and among HSBC, the Company and H2
Acquisition Corporation. Pursuant to the Agreement, each holder of Shares shall
have the right to elect to receive, in lieu of HSBC Ordinary Shares, 0.535
American Depositary Shares of HSBC ("HSBC ADSs"), with each such HSBC ADS
representing the right to receive five HSBC Ordinary Shares and evidenced by one
or more American Depositary Receipts (the "HSBC ADRs"), for each Share.

Goldman, Sachs & Co., as part of its investment banking business, is continually
engaged in performing financial analyses with respect to businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated
underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities and private placements as well as for financial analyses for
estate, corporate and other purposes. We are familiar with the Company having
provided certain investment banking services to the Company from time to time,
including having acted as joint lead manager for a public offering of $300
million of preferred stock of the Company in September 2001; having acted as
sole bookrunner for a public offering of 18.7 million Shares and $534 million of
Automatically Convertible Equity Securities ("ACES") of the Company in October
2002; having acted as commercial paper dealer for the Company, commencing in
October 2002; and having acted as its financial advisor in connection with, and
having participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the Agreement. We
also have provided certain investment banking services to HSBC from time to
time, including having acted as lead manager for a public offering of $4 billion
aggregate principal amount of Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of HSBC in
May 2000; and having acted as its financial advisor in connection with its
acquisition of Credit Commercial de France CCF (SA) in July 2000. Goldman, Sachs
& Co. provides a full range of financial advisory and securities services and,
in the course of its normal trading activities, may from time to time effect
transactions and hold securities, including derivative instruments, of the
Company or HSBC for its own account and for the accounts of customers. Goldman,
Sachs & Co. may provide investment banking services to HSBC and its subsidiaries
in the future.

In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the
Agreement; Annual Reports to Stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the
Company (including its

predecessor companies) and Annual Reviews to Stockholders of HSBC for the five
years ended December 31, 2001 and Annual Reports on Form 20-F of HSBC for the
three years ended December 31, 2001; certain interim reports to stockholders and
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company; certain interim reports to
stockholders and Reports of Foreign Private Issuers on Form 6-K of HSBC; certain
other communications from the Company and HSBC to their respective stockholders;
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by
its management; and certain cost savings and operating synergies projected by
the management of the Company to result from the transaction contemplated by the
Agreement. Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior
managements of the Company and HSBC regarding their assessment of the strategic
rationale for, and the potential benefits of, the transaction contemplated by
the merger agreement and the past and current business operations, financial
condition and future prospects of their respective companies, including
discussions with the Company with respect to the importance of the funding
environment to the financial performance of consumer finance companies. In
addition, we have reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the
Shares and the HSBC Ordinary Shares (including price and trading activity for
the HSBC ADRs), compared certain financial and stock market information for the
Company and HSBC with similar information for certain other companies the
securities of which are publicly traded, reviewed the financial terms of certain
recent business combinations in the finance industry specifically and in other
industries generally and performed such other studies and analyses as we
considered appropriate.

We have relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial,
accounting and other information discussed with or reviewed by us and have
assumed such accuracy and completeness for purposes of rendering this opinion.
As you are aware, HSBC did not make available to us its projections of expected
future performance. Accordingly, our review of such matters was limited to
discussions with the management of HSBC of certain research analysts' estimates.
We are not experts in the evaluation of loan and lease portfolios for purposes
of assessing the adequacy of the allowances for losses with respect thereto and
have assumed, with your consent, that such allowances for HSBC are in the
aggregate adequate to cover all such losses. In addition, we have not reviewed
individual credit files nor have we made an independent evaluation or appraisal
of the assets and liabilities (including any derivative or off-balance-sheet
assets or liabilities) of the Company and HSBC or any of their subsidiaries and
we have not been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. We have
assumed that all material governmental, regulatory, or other consents and
approvals necessary for the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the
Agreement will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or HSBC or
their respective subsidiaries or on the expected benefits of the transaction
contemplated by the Agreement. Our advisory services and the opinion expressed
herein are provided for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors
of the Company in connection with its consideration of the transaction
contemplated by the Agreement and such opinion does not constitute a
recommendation as to how any holder of Shares should vote with respect to such
transaction.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing and based upon such other matters as we
consider relevant, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Exchange
Ratio pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to the
holders of Shares.

Very truly yours,

The Board of Directors
Household International, Inc.
2700 Sanders Road
Prospect Heights, Illinois 60070

Members of the Board:

     You have requested our opinion as investment bankers as to the fairness,
from a financial point of view, to the holders of certain series of Household
International, Inc. (the "Company") preferred stock, as described below (the
"Company Preferred Stock"), of the cash consideration to be received as set
forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of
November 14, 2002, entered into among HSBC Holdings plc (the "Parent"),
Household International, Inc. (the "Company"), and H2 Acquisition Corporation
(the "Merger Sub"). Our opinion does not address the fairness of the
consideration to be received by holders of the Company's common stock, or the
consideration to be received by holders of the Company's shares of preferred
stock not specifically addressed by this opinion.

     The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of the Company with and into
the Merger Sub (the "Merger") pursuant to which each outstanding share of the
following classes of Company Preferred Stock:

    7.500% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series 2001-A
    7.600% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series 2002-A
    7.625% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series 2002-B

that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive cash in the amount of $1,000 ($25 per depository share) plus all
accumulated and unpaid dividends to but excluding the closing date (the
"Preferred Merger Consideration").

     In arriving at our opinion, we have reviewed certain publicly available
business and financial information relating to the Company and the Parent, as
well as the Merger Agreement and the certificate of incorporation of Household
and the certificates of designations of the Company Preferred Stock. We have
also reviewed certain other information, including the terms, call provisions,
and conditions of the Company Preferred Stock, the ratings of the Company
Preferred Stock, and certain financial and market data of the Company Preferred
Stock. In addition, we have compared certain financial, rating, and market
information for selected other issues of preferred securities, trust preferred
securities, and debt securities we deemed similar to the Company Preferred
Stock. We also considered such other information, financial studies, analyses
and investigations and financial, economic and market criteria which we deemed
relevant.

     Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., as part of its investment banking business,
is continually engaged in the valuation of banking and financial service company
securities in connection with acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for various other purposes. As specialists in the securities of
banking and financial service companies, we have experience in, and knowledge of
the valuation of banking and financial service enterprises. In the ordinary
course of our business as a broker-dealer, we may, from time to time purchase
securities from, and sell

securities to, the Company and the Parent, and as a market maker in securities,
we may from time to time have a long or short position in, and buy or sell, debt
or equity securities of the Company and the Parent for our own account and for
the accounts of our customers. We have acted exclusively for the Board of
Directors of the Company in rendering this fairness opinion and will receive a
fee from the Company for our services.

     In connection with our review, we have not assumed any responsibility for
independent verification of any of the foregoing information and have relied on
its being complete and accurate in all material respects. In addition, we have
not been requested to make, and have not made, an independent evaluation or
appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company
or the Parent, nor have we reviewed any loan or credit files of the Company or
been furnished with any such evaluations, appraisals or reviews. We have also
assumed that the Company has adequately reserved against losses that may be
incurred as a result of non-performing or defaulting loans. We are not
expressing any opinion as to the prices at which the Company Preferred Stock
will trade at any time, and are assuming that the Merger will be completed in
accordance with the terms and conditions outlined in the Merger Agreement.
Further, our opinion does not address the Company's underlying business decision
to engage in the Merger. Our opinion is necessarily based upon available
information and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they exist
and can be evaluated on the date hereof.

     It is understood that this letter is for the information of the Board of
Directors of the Company in connection with its consideration of the Merger and
does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company as to how
such stockholder should vote or act on any matter relating to the proposed
Merger.

     Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the
date hereof, the Preferred Merger Consideration offered in connection with the
Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of the Company
Preferred Stock.

                                          Very truly yours,

      SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE

SEC. 262.  APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

     (a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of
stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this
section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through
the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied
with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the
merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to sec. 228 of
this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the
fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances
described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section,
the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a stock corporation
and also a member of record of a nonstock corporation; the words "stock" and
"share" mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words and also
membership or membership interest of a member of a nonstock corporation; and the
words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a
depository representing an interest in one or more shares, or fractions thereof,
solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

     (b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or
series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be
effected pursuant to sec. 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to sec.
251(g) of this title), sec. 252, sec. 254, sec. 257, sec. 258, sec. 263 or sec.
264 of this title:

          (1) Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section
     shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which
     stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed
     to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at
     the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or
     consolidation, were either (i) listed on a national securities exchange or
     designated as a national market system security on an interdealer quotation
     system by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or (ii) held
     of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no
     appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the
     constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require
     for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation
     as provided in subsection (f) of sec. 251 of this title.

          (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, appraisal rights
     under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series
     of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required
     by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to
     Sections 251, 252, 254, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for
     such stock anything except:

             a.  Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from
        such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

             b.  Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository
        receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository
        receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective
        date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national
        securities exchange or designated as a national market system security
        on an interdealer quotation system by the National Association of
        Securities Dealers, Inc. or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

             c.  Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository
        receipts described in the foregoing subparagraphs a. and b. of this
        paragraph; or

             d.  Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and
        cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts
        described in the foregoing subparagraphs a., b. and c. of this
        paragraph.

          (3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation
     party to a merger effected under sec. 253 of this title is not owned by the
     parent corporation immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall
     be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

                                       D-1
<PAGE>
     (c)  Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that
appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of
incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision,
the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and
(e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

     (d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

          (1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights
     are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a
     meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to
     the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the
     record date for such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal
     rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) hereof that
     appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the
     constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this
     section. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such
     stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of
     the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of
     such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably
     informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the
     stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's
     shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not
     constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must
     do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after
     the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or
     resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent
     corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in
     favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the
     merger or consolidation has become effective; or

          (2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to sec. 228
     or sec. 253 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the
     effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting
     corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of
     any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are
     entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation
     and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class
     or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in
     such notice a copy of this section. Such notice may, and, if given on or
     after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify
     such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any
     stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date
     of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or
     resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand
     will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity
     of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the
     appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice did not notify
     stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either
     (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the
     effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders
     of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are
     entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or
     consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send
     such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such
     effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more
     than 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice
     need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights
     and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in accordance with
     this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of
     the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either
     notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be
     prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of
     determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each
     constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be
     not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided that,
     if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or
     consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record
     date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the
     record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the
     day on which the notice is given.

     (e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has
complied with subsections (a) and (d) hereof and who is otherwise

                                       D-2
<PAGE>
entitled to appraisal rights, may file a petition in the Court of Chancery
demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective
date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder shall have the right to
withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered
upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of
the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of subsections (a) and (d) hereof, upon written request, shall be
entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from
the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not
voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands
for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such
shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days
after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the
surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the
period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) hereof,
whichever is later.

     (f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a
copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which
shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in
Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be
filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be
accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or
resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses
therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at
least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as
the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication
shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the
surviving or resulting corporation.

     (g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the
stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to
appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an
appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to
submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation
thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder
fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to
such stockholder.

     (h) After determining the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the Court
shall appraise the shares, determining their fair value exclusive of any element
of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or
consolidation, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid upon
the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the
Court shall take into account all relevant factors. In determining the fair rate
of interest, the Court may consider all relevant factors, including the rate of
interest which the surviving or resulting corporation would have had to pay to
borrow money during the pendency of the proceeding. Upon application by the
surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate
in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, permit discovery
or other pretrial proceedings and may proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior
to the final determination of the stockholder entitled to an appraisal. Any
stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting
corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted his
certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may
participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such
stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

     (i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares,
together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the
stockholders entitled thereto. Interest may be simple or compound, as the Court
may direct. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of
holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares
represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the
certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as
other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving
or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

                                       D-3
<PAGE>

     (j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed
upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon
application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the
expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the
fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the shares entitled to an appraisal.

     (k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no
stockholder who has demanded such stockholder's appraisal rights as provided in
subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any
purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock
(except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a
date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation);
provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within
the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder
shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of
such stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or
consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with
the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to
an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding
in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the
approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as
the Court deems just.

     (1) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the
shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they
assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and
unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.

2 INFORMATION RELATING TO HSBC

     2.1 The founding member of the HSBC group, The Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation, was established in Hong Kong and Shanghai in 1865. The bank
expanded rapidly, with an emphasis on building up representation in China and
the Asia-Pacific region, while also establishing a presence in the major
financial and trading centres in Europe and America.

     2.2 HSBC is the holding company of one of the largest banking and financial
services organisations in the world, with a market capitalisation of US$104.9
billion as at 31 December 2002. As at 30 June 2002, HSBC had total assets of
US$746.3 billion and shareholders' funds of US$51.2 billion. For the year ended
31 December 2001, HSBC's operating profit was US$8.0 billion on operating income
of US$25.9 billion. The HSBC group is a strongly capitalised banking group with
a total capital ratio of 13.5 per cent and a tier 1 capital ratio of 9.7 per
cent as at 30 June 2002.

     2.3 Headquartered in London, United Kingdom, the HSBC group operates
through long-established businesses in Europe; Hong Kong SAR; the rest of
Asia-Pacific, including the Middle East and Africa; North America; and Latin
America. Within each of these geographical regions, the principal businesses
operate essentially as domestic banks and typically have a large retail deposit
base, together with strong liquidity and capital ratios, and provide services to
personal, commercial and large corporate and institutional customers. By using
the HSBC group's highly efficient technological links, businesses are able to
access the HSBC group's wide range of products and services and adapt them to
local customer needs. In addition, in certain key locations -- London, Hong Kong
SAR, New York, Geneva, Paris and Dusseldorf -- the HSBC group has significant
investment and private banking operations which, together with its commercial
banks, enable the HSBC group to service the full range of requirements of its
high net worth personal and large corporate and institutional customers.

     2.4 Through its international network of over 8,000 offices in 80 countries
and territories, the HSBC group provides a comprehensive range of financial
services: personal financial services; commercial banking; corporate, investment
banking and markets; private banking; and other activities. As part of its
strategy, the HSBC group created an international brand in 1998, using HSBC and
its hexagon symbol in most of its areas of operation.

3 CURRENT TRADING AND PROSPECTS

     The benefits derived from the breadth and capital generating strength of
the HSBC group's core domestic franchises continue to support resilient
operating performance, including into the current year to date.

     In retail markets, continuing weak demand for equity products has been more
than offset by strong growth in personal lending and mortgage banking as
consumers in some markets respond to sustained low interest rates. Deposit flows
remain strong and sales of insurance protection products and capital protected
investment products continue to grow.

     Lending to the corporate sector remains subdued and as a consequence of
successive interest rate reductions over the past 24 months, treasury income is
declining as maturing investments are redeployed in lower yielding assets.

     Mitigating the impact of lower interest rates on the deployment of the HSBC
group's liquid resources, the continuing low interest rate environment is
favourable in maintaining bad debt charges within recent experience.

     The HSBC group remains cautious about the economic outlook for the
remainder of the current year, with political factors and external events
weighing heavily on economic forecasting. This having been said, the HSBC group
remains strong in capital and earning power and is well positioned to seek
growth opportunities globally with few geographic or product constraints.

4 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

     Since the announcement on 5 August 2002 of HSBC's interim results for the
six month period ended 30 June 2002, there have been a number of developments
across the HSBC group. On 8 October 2002, HSBC announced that it had reached an
agreement to invest US$600 million in Ping An Insurance Company of China,
Limited ("Ping An"). This investment has now been made and HSBC has acquired an
interest of 10 per cent of the issued share capital of Ping An. With the
establishment of this strategic partnership, HSBC looks forward to working with
Ping An to take advantage of opportunities available in China's rapidly growing
insurance and wealth management industries.

     HSBC's most recent significant acquisition was completed on 25 November
2002 when it acquired Grupo Financiero Bital S.A. de C.V. ("GF Bital") in Mexico
by way of a cash tender offer. It received 99.59 per cent acceptance of the
offer, which resulted in HSBC paying a total consideration of approximately
US$1.135 billion. All the necessary regulatory approvals needed for the
transaction were received and HSBC has begun the process of integrating GF Bital
into the HSBC group.

     In addition, in September 2002 HSBC announced three new non-executive
director appointments when Stewart Newton, Carole Taylor and Sir Brian
Williamson agreed to join the board of HSBC.

5 INFORMATION RELATING TO HOUSEHOLD

     5.1 Household was created in 1981 as a result of a shareholder-approved
restructuring of Household Finance Corporation, which was established in 1878.
Household is principally a non-operating holding company. Household's
subsidiaries primarily provide middle-market consumers with several types of
loan products in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Household,
through its subsidiaries (including Beneficial Corporation, which was acquired
in 1998) offers real estate secured loans, auto finance loans, MasterCard and
Visa credit cards, private label credit cards, tax refund anticipation loans,
retail instalment sales financing loans and other types of unsecured loans, as
well as credit and speciality insurance products. As at 30 September 2002,
Household had approximately 32,000 employees and over 50 million active consumer
accounts. Household's principal executive office is located at 2700 Sanders
Road, Prospect Heights, Illinois 60070, USA.

     5.2 Based on Household's earnings release on 15 January 2003, as at 31
December 2002, Household had US$107.5 billion in managed receivables and US$82.6
billion in owned receivables. For the year ended 31 December 2002, Household's
income before income taxes was US$2.3 billion on net revenues of US$10.8
billion.

     5.3 Household is one of the largest independent consumer finance companies
in the United States. It is also the United States' second largest third-party
issuer of private label credit cards, the eighth largest issuer of MasterCard
and Visa credit cards and the fourth largest provider of credit insurance.

     5.4 Household is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

6 THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF HOUSEHOLD BY WAY OF MERGER

     6.1 On 14 November 2002 the boards of HSBC and Household announced that
they had reached agreement for HSBC to acquire Household by way of merger with a
wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC. The board of HSBC, which has been advised by
Morgan Stanley & Co. Limited, Rohatyn Associates LLC and HSBC Bank plc,
considers the financial terms of the acquisition to be fair and reasonable to
HSBC. In giving their advice, Morgan Stanley & Co. Limited, Rohatyn Associates
LLC and HSBC Bank plc have relied upon the HSBC board's commercial assessment of
the acquisition. The HSBC board considers the acquisition to be in the best
interests of HSBC shareholders taken as a whole and has unanimously recommended
that HSBC shareholders vote in favour of the resolution to be proposed at an
extraordinary general meeting to approve the acquisition. The board of Household
has unanimously approved the acquisition and has unanimously determined to
recommend that Household stockholders vote in favour of the resolutions to be
proposed at a special meeting of Household stockholders.

     6.2 The acquisition is to be effected by a statutory merger under Delaware
law. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Household will be merged with and
into H2 Acquisition Corporation ("H2"), a wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC.
Following the merger, H2 will continue to be a wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC
but will be renamed "Household International, Inc.".

     6.3 Based on the closing mid-market price of an HSBC ordinary share of
681.5 pence as derived from the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange
on 21 February 2003 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication
of the Listing Particulars) and assuming 1,281,972,179 HSBC ordinary shares will
be issued (not including any shares of Household common stock that may be issued
on the exercise of options or rights other than those which would lapse if not
exercised on or before the Effective Date (as defined in the merger agreement)),
the aggregate consideration to be paid by HSBC pursuant to the acquisition is
approximately US$13,860 million (approximately L8,737 million after applying an
exchange rate of US$1: L0.6304, being the noon buying rate prevailing on 21
February 2003). In addition, pursuant to the merger agreement, the outstanding
Household non-voting preferred stock will be converted into the right to receive
from HSBC cash in an aggregate amount of approximately US$1,121 million
(approximately L706.6 million), assuming the Effective Date to be 1 April 2003.

     6.4 Under the terms of the merger agreement, holders of Household common
stock will be entitled to receive, at their election, either 2.675 HSBC ordinary
shares or 0.535 HSBC ADSs (each representing five

                                       E-3
<PAGE>

HSBC ordinary shares) for each share of Household common stock (the "Exchange
Ratio"). The Household voting preferred stock will be designated for redemption
by Household pursuant to their respective terms immediately prior to the
Effective Date. It is estimated that Household will apply an aggregate amount of
approximately US$114.8 million (together with approximately US$2.2 million in
respect of accrued and unpaid dividends up to but excluding the Effective Date,
assuming the Effective Date is 1 April 2003) in redeeming the Household voting
preferred stock. The Household non-voting preferred stock will be converted in
the acquisition into the right to receive from HSBC cash in an aggregate amount
of US$1,100 million (together with approximately US$20.9 million in respect of
accrued and unpaid dividends up to but excluding the Effective Date, assuming
the Effective Date is 1 April 2003). The consideration was arrived at after
arm's length negotiations between the parties and the Directors of HSBC consider
it to be fair and reasonable.

     6.5 The merger agreement anticipated that the holders of Household common
stock would be entitled to receive the HSBC second interim dividend in respect
of 2002 which is expected to be paid in May 2003 to those HSBC shareholders on
the HSBC register of members as at 21 March 2003. As the acquisition will not
have been completed before the record date for this dividend it is expected
that, as provided for in the merger agreement, Household will instead declare a
cash dividend for holders of Household common stock on the register of members
immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in the merger agreement) in
respect of each share of Household common stock equal to 2.675 times the HSBC
second interim dividend per HSBC ordinary share. Such dividend will be paid on 6
May 2003 (the date on which the HSBC second interim dividend will be paid) or if
the acquisition is completed after 6 May 2003, promptly after the Effective
Date. The HSBC second interim dividend will be announced at the same time as
HSBC publishes its audited accounts for the financial year ended 31 December
2002, which is expected to be on 3 March 2003.

     6.6 Options over shares of Household common stock outstanding on the
Effective Date will be converted into options over HSBC ordinary shares,
adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio. Other rights to receive shares of
Household common stock outstanding on the Effective Date will be converted into
rights to receive HSBC ordinary shares, adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio.
Pursuant to their terms, the outstanding Household 8.875 per cent Adjustable
Conversion-Rate Equity Security Units will remain outstanding following
completion of the acquisition, with the purchase contracts that form a portion
of such units becoming contracts to purchase HSBC ordinary shares in lieu of
shares of Household common stock, adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio.
Pursuant to their terms, the rights to acquire shares of Household common stock
under the Household zero-coupon convertible debt securities will be converted,
as a consequence of the acquisition, into rights to acquire HSBC ordinary
shares, adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio.

     6.7 The acquisition is subject to a number of conditions including its
approval by the HSBC shareholders and Household stockholders in their respective
meetings and a number of regulatory and other consents and approvals in the USA,
UK, Canada and other relevant jurisdictions. Application has been made to the
relevant governmental and regulatory authorities for the necessary consents and
clearances.

     6.8 Household has agreed to pay HSBC a termination fee of US$550 million
under certain circumstances if the acquisition is not completed.

     6.9 The acquisition is expected to be completed at the end of the first
quarter of 2003.

     6.10 HSBC has appointed Computershare Investor Services LLC as exchange
agent for the purpose of exchanging certificates formerly representing shares of
Household common stock and Household non-voting preferred stock for HSBC
ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs or cash, as the case may be. The exchange agent
will send to each holder of record as at the Effective Time of Household common
stock or Household non-voting preferred stock a letter of transmittal for use in
effecting delivery of certificates representing such stock to the exchange
agent. The letter of transmittal will require each holder of Household common
stock to make an election to receive either HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs.
If a holder of Household common stock does not make an election, the exchange
agent will return the letter of transmittal to the holder for completion. If a
holder of Household common stock elects to receive HSBC ordinary shares, the
holder will receive the HSBC ordinary shares in certificated form unless the
holder elects in the letter of transmittal to receive them in uncertificated
form through CREST.

                                       E-4
<PAGE>

     6.11 On surrendering a certificate representing Household common stock for
cancellation to the exchange agent together with a duly executed letter of
transmittal, the holder will be entitled to receive in exchange:

          6.11.1 the whole number of HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs that the
     holder of Household common stock has the right to receive pursuant to the
     merger agreement;

          6.11.2 an amount of cash in lieu of fractional HSBC ordinary shares or
     HSBC ADSs; and

          6.11.3 any dividends or other distributions on the HSBC ordinary
     shares or HSBC ADSs, as the case may be, that have a record date after the
     Effective Date and shall have been declared and paid prior to the exchange
     (in the event that a dividend or other distribution has a record date after
     the Effective Date and has been declared but not yet paid prior to the
     exchange, the holder will be entitled to be paid such dividend or other
     distribution at the same time as all other holders of HSBC ordinary shares
     and/or HSBC ADSs).

     6.12 On surrendering a certificate representing Household non-voting
preferred stock for cancellation to the exchange agent together with a duly
executed letter of transmittal, the holder will be entitled to receive in
exchange:

          6.12.1 cash in the amount of US$25 per depositary share; and

          6.12.2 all accumulated and unpaid dividends up to but excluding the
     Effective Date, without interest.

     6.13 With respect to both Household common stock and Household non-voting
preferred stock, taxes will be withheld as required.

     6.14 Household certificates that are surrendered will be cancelled. No
holder of unsurrendered certificates will receive any dividends or other
distributions in respect of HSBC ordinary shares or HSBC ADSs to which the
holder is entitled under the merger agreement, or be entitled to vote such HSBC
ordinary shares, until the Household certificate registered to the holder is
surrendered to the exchange agent. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
amount payable on surrender of certificates.

7 EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING

     7.1 In view of the size of the transaction, it will be necessary to obtain
HSBC ordinary shareholders' approval of the acquisition. For this purpose, the
board of HSBC has convened an extraordinary general meeting for 11.00 a.m. on 28
March 2003. At the extraordinary general meeting, an ordinary resolution will be
proposed:

          (a) to approve the acquisition (including the arrangements to be put
     in place in relation to outstanding options over, and rights to receive,
     Household common stock) and to authorise the board of HSBC (or any duly
     authorised committee thereof) to take the necessary steps to implement it,
     subject to such non-material modifications as the Directors of HSBC think
     fit; and

          (b) to authorise the Directors of HSBC for the purposes of section 80
     of the Companies Act 1985 to allot in connection with the acquisition
     additional relevant securities (as defined in that section) up to an
     aggregate nominal amount of US$702,863,189. This amount is equal to the
     nominal amount of the approximate maximum number of new HSBC ordinary
     shares which may be issued as a consequence of the acquisition.

     7.2 This authority is in addition to the existing authority granted to the
board of HSBC at the annual general meeting of HSBC held on 31 May 2002, which
will remain in full force and effect until its expiry at the annual general
meeting of HSBC to be held in 2003, when a new resolution will be proposed, in
the usual way, granting authority to the board of HSBC to allot shares.

8 ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     HSBC intends to account for the acquisition using acquisition accounting
under UK GAAP. Under this method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of
Household will be recorded at their respective fair values as at the completion
date of the acquisition and added to those of HSBC. Financial statements and
results of operations of HSBC reported after completion of the acquisition will
reflect these values, but prior financial statements of HSBC will not be
restated to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations
of Household.

9 SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

     9.1 Save as disclosed in paragraphs 3 ("Current Trading and Prospects") and
4 ("Recent Developments") above, there has been no significant change in the
financial or trading position of the HSBC group since 30 June 2002, being the
date to which HSBC's last interim financial statements have been prepared.

     9.2 There has been no significant change in the financial or trading
position of the Household group since 31 December 2002, being the date to which
Household's most recent earnings release statement has been published.

10 LITIGATION

     10.1 No member of the HSBC group is or has been involved in any legal or
arbitration proceedings which may have, or have had during the twelve months
prior to the date of this document, a significant effect on the financial
position of the HSBC group, nor is HSBC aware that any such proceedings are
pending or threatened.

     10.2 Save as disclosed below, no member of the Household group is or has
been involved in any legal or arbitration proceedings which may have, or have
had during the twelve months prior to the date of this document, a significant
effect on the financial position of the Household group, nor is Household aware
that any such proceedings are pending or threatened:

          10.2.1 Several lawsuits have been filed alleging violations of law
     with respect to the acquisition. These lawsuits are described below. The
     lawsuits are in their preliminary stages; Household believes that the
     claims against it lack merit and intends to defend the lawsuits vigorously.

          Two of the lawsuits are pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County,
     Illinois, Chancery Division. One, McLaughlin v. Aldinger et al., No. 02 CH
     20683 (filed on 15 November 2002), asserts claims on behalf of a purported
     class of holders of Household common stock against Household and certain of
     its officers and directors for breach of fiduciary duty in connection with
     the acquisition on the grounds that the defendants allegedly failed to take
     appropriate steps to maximise the value of a merger transaction for holders
     of Household common stock. The McLaughlin complaint contends that
     plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm unless the acquisition is
     prohibited, but seeks only unspecified damages. The other, Pace v. Aldinger
     et al., No. 02 CH 19270 (filed on 24 October 2002 and amended on 15
     November 2002), is both a derivative lawsuit on behalf of Household and a
     purported class action on behalf of holders of Household common stock. This
     lawsuit was filed prior to the announcement of the acquisition and
     originally asserted claims relating to Household's pre-acquisition
     accounting practices. It has since been amended to allege that Household
     and certain of its officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties
     in connection with the acquisition. The complaint seeks to prohibit the
     acquisition as well as unspecified damages (including punitive damages)
     allegedly stemming from both the acquisition and pre-acquisition activity.

          A third lawsuit relating to the acquisition, Williamson v. Aldinger et
     al., No. 03 C00331 (filed on 15 January 2003), is pending in the United
     States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. This
     derivative lawsuit on behalf of Household claims that certain of
     Household's officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties and
     committed corporate waste by agreeing to the acquisition and allegedly
     failing to take appropriate steps to maximise the value of a merger
     transaction. The complaint seeks to prohibit the acquisition as well as
     unspecified damages (including punitive damages).

          10.2.2 The Multi-State Settlement Agreement

          On 11 October 2002, Household reached a preliminary agreement with a
     multi-state working group of US state attorneys general and regulatory
     agencies to effect a US nationwide resolution of alleged violations of US
     federal and/or state consumer protection, consumer financing and banking
     laws and regulations with respect to secured real estate lending from
     Household's retail branch consumer lending operations. This preliminary
     agreement, and related consent decrees entered into with each of the 50 US
     states and the District of Columbia, are referred to collectively as the
     "Multi-State Settlement Agreement". The Multi-State Settlement Agreement
     requires Household to establish a settlement fund and to pay certain
     expenses of investigation and administration. Household will also provide
     greater disclosures and alternatives for customers in connection with
     "non-prime" mortgage lending originated by its retail branch network. No
     fines, penalties or punitive damages are being assessed by the US states
     pursuant to the Multi-State Settlement Agreement. In addition, Household
     will unilaterally amend all branch originated real estate secured loans to
     provide that no pre-payment penalty is payable later than 24 months after
     origination. As described in more detail below, the Multi-State Settlement
     Agreement became effective as at 16 December 2002.

          Under the terms of the Multi-State Settlement Agreement, Household
     will establish a fund of US$484 million to be divided among all
     participating states (including the District of Columbia), with each state
     receiving a proportionate share of the funds based upon the volume of the
     retail branch originated real estate secured loans made by Household in
     that state during the period between 1 January 1999 and 30 September 2002.
     Household agreed to deposit these monies into the fund in three equal
     instalments. Household made the first two deposits on 15 January and 14
     February 2003. It will make the remaining deposit on 17 March 2003.

          Household has also paid US$10.2 million to the states as reimbursement
     for the expenses of their investigation and will pay US$9.8 million of the
     fees and expenses of an independent administrator. At its expense,
     Household will also retain an independent monitor to report on Household's
     compliance with the Multi-State Settlement Agreement over the next five
     years.

          Each borrower that receives a payment under the Multi-State Settlement
     Agreement will be required to release all civil claims against Household
     relating to its consumer lending practices. Each state has agreed that the
     settlement resolves all current civil investigations and proceedings by
     participating attorneys general and state lending regulators relating to
     the lending practices at issue.

          Household recorded a pre-tax charge in the third quarter of the
     financial year 2002 of US$525 million reflecting the costs of the
     Multi-State Settlement Agreement and related matters.

          The Multi-State Settlement Agreement first became effective as at 16
     December 2002 with the filing of related consent decrees in 41 states and
     the District of Columbia. Consent decrees or similar documentation have now
     been entered into with all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

          Household has also been named in purported class actions by
     individuals and consumer groups in the United States (such as the AARP and
     the Association of Community Organisations for Reform Now) claiming that
     Household's loan products or its lending policies and practices are unfair
     or misleading to consumers. Before any claim can proceed on behalf of the
     purported class, judicial certification of the class is required. To date,
     none of the class claims has been certified. Although the Multi-State
     Settlement Agreement does not cause the immediate dismissal of these
     purported class actions Household believes it substantially reduces the
     risk to it of any material liability that may result since every consumer
     who receives payments as a result of the Multi-State Settlement Agreement
     must release Household from any liability for such claims. Household
     intends to seek resolution of these related legal actions provided it is
     financially prudent to do so. Otherwise, Household intends to vigorously
     dispute the allegations. Regardless of the approach taken by Household with
     respect to these purported class actions, and based on a review of the
     allegations set out in the complaints and of their status, Household
     believes that any liability that may result will not have a material
     financial impact on Household.

          10.2.3 As reported in Household's annual report on Form 10-K/A for the
     year ended 31 December 2001, which was filed with the SEC on 27 August
     2002, Household restated its previously reported consolidated financial
     statements. The restatement relates to certain MasterCard and Visa
     co-branding and affinity credit card relationships and a third party
     marketing agreement, which were entered into between 1992 and 1999. All
     were part of Household's credit card services segment. In consultation with
     Household's prior auditors, Arthur Andersen LLP, Household treated payments
     made in connection with these agreements as pre-paid assets and amortised
     them in accordance with the underlying economics of the agreements.
     Household's current auditors, KPMG LLP, advised Household that, in their
     view, these payments should have either been charged against earnings at
     the time they were made or amortised over a shorter period of time. There
     was no significant change as a result of these adjustments on the prior
     periods net earnings trends previously reported. The restatement resulted
     in a US$359.9 million, after-tax, retroactive reduction to retained
     earnings at 31 December 2001. As a result of the restatement, Household and
     its directors, certain officers and former auditors have been involved in
     various legal proceedings, some of which purport to be class actions,
     alleging violations of US federal securities law. These actions, which were
     filed between August and October 2002, seek to recover damages in respect
     of allegedly false and misleading statements about Household's stock. To
     date, none of the class claims has been certified. These legal actions have
     been consolidated into a single action (with the Lawrence E. Jaffe Pension
     Plan as the lead plaintiff); a consolidated and amended complaint is to be
     filed by 7 March 2003. Since the complaint has not yet been filed, it is
     not possible to state what damages are sought. Household believes that it
     has not, and its officers and directors have not, committed any wrongdoing
     and in each instance there will be no finding of improper activities that
     may result in a material liability to Household or any of its officers or
     directors.

     10.3 Household is subject to ongoing regulation by the SEC, the OCC and
various other US (federal and state) and foreign regulatory agencies, which
agencies have broad oversight, supervisory and enforcement powers. Within the
scope of these powers, requests have been made, to which Household has
responded, for factual materials surrounding the matters covered under
paragraphs 10.2.2 and 10.2.3 above. Household believes that it has not, and its
officers and directors have not, committed any wrongdoing and there will be no
finding of improper activities that may result in a material liability to
Household or any of its officers or directors.

</Table>

     The registered office and principal place of business of HSBC is at 8
Canada Square, London E14 5HQ, United Kingdom.

     Assuming the acquisition is completed, William F. Aldinger, III, who is
currently Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Household, will become a
member of the board of HSBC.

     Following completion of the acquisition, Mr Aldinger will serve as Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer of Household until 1 January 2004 and thereafter as
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Household and HSBC North America, Inc.

13 PROPOSED DIRECTOR'S NEW EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

     13.1 Mr Aldinger has entered into a new employment agreement with Household
for a term of three years which will commence on the Effective Date.

     13.2 During the term of the agreement, Mr Aldinger will be paid an annual
base salary equal to his annual base salary as at the date of the merger
agreement (US$1 million), and an annual bonus in an amount at least equal to the
annual average of Mr Aldinger's bonuses earned with respect to the three-year
period ended 2001 (pro rated for any partial year) (US$4 million). Pursuant to
the terms of Mr Aldinger's new employment agreement, a termination of employment
is generally effective immediately upon receipt of notice by either party,
except that a termination due to Mr Aldinger's disability requires 30 days
advance notice following his absence from employment on a full-time basis for
180 consecutive business days.

                                       E-9
<PAGE>
     13.3 Within 30 days of the Effective Date, subject to the approval of the
trustee of the HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan 2000, Mr Aldinger will
receive a one-time special retention grant of HSBC ordinary shares with a value
equal to US$10 million (the "Special Restricted Shares"), based on the closing
mid-market price of HSBC ordinary shares on the date of grant. The Special
Restricted Shares will vest in three equal instalments on each of the first
three anniversaries of the Effective Date, as long as Mr Aldinger remains
employed on each applicable vesting date, subject to accelerated vesting upon a
termination of employment by Household without "cause", by Mr Aldinger for "good
reason" or due to his death or disability. After each of the first and second
anniversaries of the Effective Date, subject to the approval of the trustee of
the HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan 2000, Mr Aldinger will receive an
additional grant of HSBC ordinary shares with a value equal to at least US$5.5
million ("Additional Restricted Shares"), based on the closing mid-market price
of HSBC ordinary shares on the applicable date of grant. The Additional
Restricted Shares will generally be subject to the same terms and conditions as
the Special Restricted Shares. To the extent all or a portion of any of the
above grants of Restricted Shares cannot be made under the HSBC Holdings
Restricted Share Plan 2000, Mr Aldinger will receive a cash bonus equal to the
amount of the grant of Restricted Shares that he was not able to receive,
subject to the same general terms and conditions as such grant.

     13.4 During the term, except with respect to benefits under qualified and
non-qualified excess and supplemental defined benefit retirement plans, Mr
Aldinger will receive employee benefits and benefits in kind that are no less
favourable than those provided to him immediately prior to the date of the
merger agreement. In respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2002, Mr
Aldinger's participation in Household's qualified and non-qualified defined
contribution plans entitled him to a company matching contribution and he
received taxable benefits in kind for financial planning services, a car
allowance, excess liability and life insurance premium payments and personal
travel expenses, which contributions and taxable benefits in kind equal
approximately US$518,000 in the aggregate.

     13.5 As at the Effective Date, Mr Aldinger's benefits under Household's
qualified and non-qualified excess and supplemental defined benefit retirement
plans will be frozen, and Mr Aldinger will be entitled to receive the retirement
benefits provided under his existing employment agreement. The pension benefits
for Mr Aldinger are provided on a defined benefit basis under the Household
qualified and non-qualified pension plans and a supplemental executive
retirement plan adopted in 1997 for Mr Aldinger (the "SERP"). The annual pension
benefit under these arrangements generally equals a percentage of his Final
Average Salary (as defined below) not in excess of Covered Compensation (as
defined below), plus a percentage of his Final Average Salary that exceeds
Covered Compensation. "Final Average Salary" equals the average of salary plus
bonus for the 48 successive highest paid months out of the employee's last ten
years of service. "Covered Compensation" is the average of the US Social
Security taxable wage base over the 35-year period ending in the year of
retirement or earlier termination of employment. The SERP provides Mr Aldinger
with a benefit based on the pension plan formula but with twenty years of
benefit service added and with an offset for benefits payable under not only the
Household qualified and non-qualified plans but also for the pension benefits
payable to Mr Aldinger under the defined benefit pension plans of Wells Fargo
and Citibank.

     13.6 Mr Aldinger's new agreement provides that if his employment is
terminated during the term by him for "good reason", or by Household for reasons
other than "cause" or disability, he will be entitled to:

          13.6.1 a pro rata target annual bonus for the financial year of the
     date of termination;

          13.6.2 a payment equal to his annual base salary plus the average of
     his annual bonuses with respect to the three-year period ended 2001, times
     the number of full and partial months from the date of termination until
     the third anniversary of the Effective Date, divided by twelve;

          13.6.3 the immediate vesting and exercisability of each Household
     stock option, restricted stock award and other equity-based award or
     performance award (or cash equivalent) that is outstanding as at the date
     of termination and treatment as retirement eligible for purposes of
     exercising any such award;

          13.6.4 for the remainder of his life and that of his current spouse,
     continued medical and dental benefits at Household's cost; and

          13.6.5 his retirement benefits in a lump sum (as described in
     paragraph 13.5 above).

                                       E-10
<PAGE>

     13.7 If any payments or benefits that Mr Aldinger receives are subject to
the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the US Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (as amended), his agreement provides for an additional payment to restore
him to the after-tax position that he would have been in had the excise tax not
been imposed.

     13.8 The new employment agreement also provides that, during his employment
with Household, and for a period of one year after the termination of his
employment for any reason, other than a termination of employment by Household
without "cause" or a resignation by Mr Aldinger for "good reason", Mr Aldinger
may not become associated with certain competitive entities that are actively
engaged in the consumer lending business (including mortgage and credit card
lending) and may not solicit the business of any entity that was a significant
commercial customer or client of Household and its subsidiaries during the
six-month period prior to his termination date. The new employment agreement
also contains a confidentiality provision and a non-solicitation of Household
employees restriction following certain terminations of employment.

     13.9 Upon the Effective Date, Mr Aldinger's new employment agreement will
supersede his existing employment agreement with Household, which will be deemed
to have been terminated due to a "qualifying termination", entitling him to the
cash payments and other benefits under that agreement as follows:

          13.9.1 a pro rata annual bonus to the date of termination, based on
     the highest of the annual bonuses payable to Mr Aldinger during the three
     years preceding the year in which the termination occurs;

          13.9.2 a payment equal to three times the sum of Mr Aldinger's base
     salary and highest annual bonus; and

          13.9.3 a payment equal to the value of three years of additional
     employer contributions under Household's tax-qualified and supplemental
     defined contribution plans.

     Following completion of the Acquisition, Mr. Aldinger will be eligible to
receive approximately US$20.3 million in satisfaction of the cash severance
obligations described in paragraphs 13.9.1 to 13.9.3 above under his existing
employment agreement with Household.

     In addition, upon a qualifying termination following a change of control,
Mr Aldinger will be entitled to continued welfare benefit coverage for three
years after the date of termination, three years of additional age and service
credit under Household's tax-qualified and supplemental defined benefit
retirement plans, and outplacement services. If any amounts or benefits received
under the employment agreement or otherwise are subject to the excise tax
imposed under section 4999 of the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended),
an additional payment will be made to restore Mr Aldinger to the after-tax
position in which he would have been if the excise tax had not been imposed.
