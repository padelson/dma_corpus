In addition, all Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall automatically be revoked if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VII. If a Cash Election or Stock Election is revoked with respect to shares of Florida Rock Common Stock represented by Florida Rock Certificates, Florida Rock Certificates representing such shares shall be promptly returned to the holder that submitted the same to the Exchange Agent. 

  

 (g) The determination of the Exchange Agent (or the joint determination of Vulcan and Florida Rock, in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to make any such determination) shall be conclusive and binding as to whether or not Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall have been properly made or revoked pursuant to this Section 2.2 and as to when Cash Elections, Stock Elections and revocations were received by the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent (or Vulcan and Florida Rock jointly, in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to make the following computation) shall also make all computations as to the proration contemplated by Section 2.3, and absent manifest error this computation shall be conclusive and binding. The Exchange Agent may, with the written agreement of Vulcan, after Vulcans reasonable consultation with Florida Rock, make any rules as are consistent with this Section 2.2 for the implementation of the Cash Elections and Stock Elections provided for in this Agreement as shall be necessary or desirable to effect these Cash Elections and Stock Elections. 

  

 2.3. _Florida Rock Proration_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject to Sections 2.1(b) and 2.4): 

  

 (a) The Cash Percentage (as defined below) of the shares of Florida Rock Common Stock (other than the Excluded Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such number, the " _Cash Cap Number_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and all other shares of Florida Rock Common Stock (other than the Excluded Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration. The " _Cash Percentage_ " shall be equal to 70%, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.1(d). 

  

 (b) If the aggregate number of Cash Electing shares of Florida Rock Common Stock (such number, the " _Cash Election Number_ ") exceeds the Cash Cap Number, then (i) all Stock Electing Florida Rock Shares and Non-Electing Florida Rock Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and (ii) the number of Cash Electing Florida Rock Shares of each shareholder of Florida Rock that shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Cash Electing Florida Rock Shares of such shareholder by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Cap Number and the denominator of which is the Cash Election Number, with the remaining number of such holders Cash Electing Florida Rock Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) If the Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Cap Number (such difference between the Cash Election Number and Cash Cap Number, the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then (x) all Cash Electing Florida Rock Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and (y) the Stock Electing Florida Rock Shares and Non-Electing Florida Rock Shares shall be treated in the following manner: 

   

 (i) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the aggregate number of Non-Electing Florida Rock Shares, then (x) all Stock Electing Florida Rock Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and (y) the Non-Electing Florida Rock Shares of each shareholder of Florida Rock shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Electing Florida Rock Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Non-Electing Florida Rock Shares of such shareholder by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of Non-Electing Florida Rock Shares, with the remaining number of such holders Non-Electing Florida Rock Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; or 

   

 (ii) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the aggregate number of Non-Electing Florida Rock Shares, then (x) all Non-Electing Florida Rock Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and (y) the number of Stock Electing Florida Rock Shares of each shareholder of Florida Rock that shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Stock Electing Florida Rock Shares of such shareholder by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which the Shortfall Number exceeds the aggregate number of Non-Electing Florida Rock Shares, and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of Stock Electing Florida Rock Shares, with the remaining number of such holders Stock Electing Florida Rock Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration.

(i) As of and from time to time after the Effective Time, Holdco shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the shareholders of Florida Rock and Vulcan, (A) certificates or, at Holdcos option, evidence of shares in book entry form, representing shares of Holdco Common Stock in denominations as the Exchange Agent may reasonably specify and (B) cash, in each case as are issuable or payable, respectively, pursuant to this Article II in respect of shares of Florida Rock Common Stock for which Florida Rock Certificates or Florida Rock Book-Entry Shares have been properly delivered to the Exchange Agent or the cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares. Such certificates (or evidence of book-entry form, as the case may be) for shares of Holdco Common Stock and such cash so deposited, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." 

   

 (ii) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash deposited with the Exchange Agent by Holdco as directed by Holdco, _provided_ that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Cash Consideration payable to holders of shares of Florida Rock Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration or cash in lieu of fractional interests, and Holdco and Vulcan shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of shares of Florida Rock Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration in the amount of any such losses. Any interest or income produced by such investments shall not be deemed part of the Exchange Fund and shall be payable to Holdco or Vulcan, as Holdco directs. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Holdco shall cause to be mailed to (x) each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of Non-Electing Florida Rock Shares (such holders, " _Non-Electing Florida Rock Holders_ ") subject to Section 2.3 above, and (y) each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of shares of Vulcan Common Stock (such holders, " _Former Vulcan Holders_ " and such shares, " _Former Vulcan Shares_ ")): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be 

   #####

to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to
the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of
Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such shares, for payment of the Merger
Consideration therefor. Such letter of transmittal shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as Holdco may specify and shall be reasonably
acceptable to Florida Rock. 

   

 (ii) (x) Each former shareholder of Florida Rock who properly made and did not revoke a Cash Election or Stock Election shall be entitled to receive in exchange for such shareholders Electing Florida Rock Shares the following as specified in clauses (A) and (B), and (y) upon surrender by a Non-Electing Florida Rock Holder to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, each Non-Electing Florida Rock Holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor: (A) the number of whole shares of Holdco Common Stock, if any, into which such holders shares of Florida Rock Common Stock represented by such holders properly surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, were converted in accordance with this Article II (after taking into account all shares of Florida Rock Common Stock to which an election or non-election of the same type were made), and such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled, and (B) a check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any required withholdings pursuant to Section 2.5(g)) equal to (I) the amount of cash (including the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional interests in shares of Holdco Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.5(d)), if any, into which such holders shares of Florida Rock Common Stock represented by such holders properly surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, were converted in accordance with this Article II, plus (II) any cash dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.5(c). 

   

 (iii) Upon surrender by a Former Vulcan Holder to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, each Former Vulcan Holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor: (A) the number of whole shares of Holdco Common Stock into which such holders shares of Vulcan Common Stock represented by such holders properly surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, were converted in accordance with this Article II, and such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled, and (B) a check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any required withholdings pursuant to Section 2.5(g)) equal to any cash dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.5(c). 

   

 (iv) If payment or issuance of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it 

   ##### 

  

    

shall be a condition of payment or issuance that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the person requesting such payment or issuance shall
have paid to the Exchange Agent any transfer and other Taxes required by
reason of the payment or issuance of the Merger Consideration to a person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall
have established to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax
either has been paid or is not applicable. In the event that any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holders compliance with
the replacement requirements established by the Exchange Agent, including, if
necessary, the posting by the holder of a bond in customary amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
the Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for the lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable
in respect of the shares of Florida Rock Common Stock or Vulcan Common Stock,
as the case may be, represented by the Certificate pursuant to this Article
II. 

   

 (v) No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II, the issuance or payment of which (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares) shall be deemed to be the satisfaction in full of all rights pertaining to shares of Florida Rock Common Stock converted in the Florida Rock Merger and shares of Vulcan Common Stock converted in the Vulcan Merger. 

   

 (vi) At the Effective Time and the Initial Effective Time, respectively, the stock transfer books of Florida Rock and Vulcan shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Florida Rock Common Stock or Vulcan Common Stock, respectively, that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time and the Initial Effective Time, respectively. After the Effective Time and the Initial Effective Time, respectively, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to Florida Rock or Vulcan for transfer shall be cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article II. 

  

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Holdco Common Stock issuable with respect to the shares of Florida Rock Common Stock or Vulcan Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares until those Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are surrendered as provided in this Article II. Upon surrender, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the shares of Holdco Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of surrender, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to those shares of Holdco Common Stock with a record date on or after the date of the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of this surrender and not previously paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to those shares of Holdco Common Stock with a record date on or after the date of the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares evidencing Florida Rock Common Stock, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of Holdco. In lieu thereof, upon surrender of the applicable Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, Holdco shall pay each holder of Florida Rock Common Stock an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all shares of Florida Rock Common Stock held at the Effective Time and for which an election or non-election of the same type was made by such holder) would otherwise be entitled, by (b) the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (" _NYSE_ ") for a share of Vulcan Common Stock on the last trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time. 

  

 (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the shareholders of Florida Rock and Vulcan on the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Holdco, upon demand by Holdco, and any shareholders of Florida Rock or Vulcan who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Holdco for payment of their claim for any part of the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to Holdco Common Stock. 

  

 (f) _No Liability_. None of Vulcan, Florida Rock or Holdco shall be liable to any holder of shares of Florida Rock Common Stock or Vulcan Common Stock for cash or shares of Holdco Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

 (g) _Withholding_. Holdco and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Florida Rock Common Stock or shares of Vulcan Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Holdco or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Florida Rock Common Stock or shares of Vulcan Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Holdco or the Exchange Agent. 

  

 2.6. _Florida Rock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_. The Board of Directors of Florida Rock or the appropriate committee thereof shall take all action necessary so that: 

  

 (a) Effective as of at least ten (10) business days prior to the Election Date, Florida Rock shall cause each option or other right to acquire Florida Rock Common Stock under any Florida Rock Stock Plan (as defined in Section 3.1(b)) (a " _Florida Rock Stock Option_ "), to become fully vested and exercisable. In connection therewith, Florida Rock shall provide written notice to each holder of a Florida Rock Stock Option, that (i) such Florida Rock Stock Option shall be, as at the date of such notice, exercisable in full, (ii) such Florida Rock Stock Option shall terminate at the Effective Time and (iii) if such Florida Rock Stock Option is 

   ##### 

  

    

not exercised or otherwise terminated on or before the fourth business day
prior to the Election Date, such Florida Rock Stock Option shall be treated
as set forth in Section 2.6(b) below. 

  

 (b) Each Florida Rock Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, cease to represent an option to acquire shares of Florida Rock Common Stock and shall instead represent the right to receive a cash amount equal to the Option Consideration for each share of Florida Rock Common Stock then subject to such Florida Rock Stock Option, which Option Consideration shall be paid as soon after the Closing Date as shall be practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Holdco and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Option Consideration otherwise payable such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Option Consideration_ " means, with respect to any share of Florida Rock Common Stock issuable under a particular Florida Rock Stock Option, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the Cash Consideration over (ii) the exercise price payable in respect of such share of Florida Rock Common Stock issuable under such Florida Rock Stock Option. 

  

 (c) Each stock unit in respect of a share of Florida Rock Common Stock under any Florida Rock Stock Plan (the " _Florida Rock Stock Units_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, be converted into a number of stock units in respect of Holdco Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Florida Rock Common Stock underlying the Florida Rock Stock Units immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. At and after the Effective Time, the Florida Rock Stock Units shall continue to be payable or distributable in accordance with the terms of the Director Stock Purchase Plan and any individual agreement relating to such Florida Rock Stock Units, subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. 

  

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, Florida Rock shall take all actions that are necessary (i) to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.6, including amending the terms of the Florida Rock Stock Plan, and (ii) to ensure that no individual shall have the right to receive any Florida Rock Common Stock in connection with the exercise of a Florida Rock Stock Option or settlement of a Florida Rock Stock Unit following the Effective Time. Florida Rock shall keep Vulcan fully informed, with respect to all amendments, resolutions, notices and actions that Vulcan intends to adopt, distribute or take in connection with the matters described in this Section 2.6, and shall provide Vulcan with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all such amendments, resolutions and notices. 

  

 2.7. _Vulcan Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_. The Board of Directors of Vulcan or the appropriate committee thereof shall take all action necessary so that: 

  

 (a) Each option or other right to acquire Vulcan Common Stock under any Vulcan Stock Plan (as defined in Section 3.2(b)) (a " _Vulcan Stock Option_ "), and each stock appreciation right with respect to Vulcan Common Stock under any Vulcan Stock Plan (a " _Vulcan SAR_ ") which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall, as of the Initial Effective Time, cease to represent an option on, stock appreciation right with respect to, or other right to acquire, shares of Vulcan Common Stock and shall instead represent the right to purchase (in the case of Vulcan Stock Options) or a stock 

   ##### 

  

    

appreciation right with respect to (in the case of Vulcan SARs) a number of
shares of Holdco Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Vulcan Common
Stock subject to such Vulcan Stock Option or Vulcan SAR immediately prior to
the Initial Effective Time. The exercise price or base price per share of
Holdco Common Stock subject to any such Vulcan Stock Option or Vulcan SAR at
and after the Initial Effective Time shall be equal to the exercise price or
base price per share of Vulcan Common Stock subject to such Vulcan Stock
Option or Vulcan SAR prior to the Initial Effective Time. 

  

 (b) Each restricted stock unit, deferred stock unit or phantom unit in respect of a share of Vulcan Common Stock (the " _RSUs_ ") which is outstanding under any Vulcan Stock Plan or otherwise (including any RSUs held in participant accounts under any employee benefit or compensation plan or arrangement of Vulcan) immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time shall, as of the Initial Effective Time, be converted into a number of restricted stock units in respect of shares of Holdco Common Stock, equal to the number of shares underlying RSUs held by the grantee immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time. 

  

 2.8. _Stock Plans_. Following the Closing Date, Holdco may grant equity awards under the Vulcan Stock Plans and the Florida Rock Stock Plans to the extent shares are available for grant under any such plan, in accordance with the mergers and acquisitions exemption to the equity compensation plan shareholder approval requirement under the NYSE rules.

Except (x) with respect to any subsection of this Section 3.1, as set forth in the correspondingly identified subsection of the disclosure letter delivered by Florida Rock to Vulcan concurrently herewith (the " _Florida Rock Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being understood by the parties that any information disclosed in one subsection of the Florida Rock Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be disclosed for purposes of each other subsection of the Florida Rock Disclosure Letter to which the relevance of such information is reasonably apparent) or (y) as disclosed in the Florida Rock SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof (excluding, in each case, any disclosures set forth in any risk factor section, in any section relating to forward looking statements and any other disclosures included therein to the extent that they are cautionary, predictive, or forward looking in nature), Florida Rock represents and warrants to Vulcan as follows: 

  

 (a) _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of Florida Rock and its Significant Subsidiaries (as defined below) is a corporation or other entity duly organized, validly existing and, if applicable, in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified and, if applicable, in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification necessary, in each case, other than as would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Florida Rock. The Florida Rock Charter and Florida Rock Bylaws, copies of which have been made available to Vulcan, are true, complete and correct copies of such documents as in effect on the date hereof. As used in this Agreement: 

   ##### 

  

   

 (i) the word " _Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any party means any corporation or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, (A) of which such party or any other Subsidiary of such party is a general partner (excluding partnerships, the general partnership interests of which held by such party or any Subsidiary of such party do not have a majority of the voting interests in such partnership), or (B) a majority of the stock or other equity interests of which that have by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or others performing similar functions with respect to such corporation or other organization is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such party or by any one or more of its Subsidiaries, or by such party and one or more of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that the joint venture between Florida Rock and Patriot Transportation Holding, Inc. (" _Patriot_ ") shall be considered a Subsidiary of Florida Rock for purposes of this Agreement. 

   

 (ii) a " _Significant Subsidiary_ " means any Subsidiary of Florida Rock or Vulcan, as the case may be, that constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of such party within the meaning of Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "); and 

   

 (iii) the term " _material adverse effect_ " means, with respect to any party hereto, a material adverse effect on the financial condition, businesses or results of operations of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; provided that, for purposes of this clause (iii) the following shall not be deemed to have a "material adverse effect": any change or event caused by or resulting from (A) changes, in prevailing economic or market conditions or the securities, credit or financial markets in the United States or elsewhere (except to the extent those changes have a materially disproportionate effect on such entity and its Subsidiaries relative to other similarly situated participants in the industries in which they operate), (B) changes or events, affecting the industries in which they operate generally (except to the extent those changes or events have a materially disproportionate effect on such entity and its Subsidiaries relative to other similarly situated participants in the industries in which they operate), (C) changes in generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applicable to such entity and its Subsidiaries, (D) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability or interpretations thereof by any Governmental Entity, (E) the announcement of this Agreement, (F) the impact of changes in the housing or commercial building markets in the State of Florida, whether occurring prior to or after the date of this Agreement, (G) any weather-related or other force majeure event (except to the extent those events have a materially disproportionate effect on such entity and its Subsidiaries relative to other similarly situated participants in the industries in which they operate), or (H) any developments (including adverse judgments) in the litigation matter set forth on Schedule 3.1(a)(iii) of the Florida Rock Disclosure Letter. 

   

 (iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely with respect to Sections 5.3 and 6.2(d) of this Agreement, " _material adverse effect_ " with respect to Florida Rock shall mean, a disposition (or commitment to do same) of Vulcan or Florida Rock assets or businesses (subject to the remainder of this paragraph) that, individually or in the aggregate, generated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (" _EBITDA_ ") equal to or greater than $18.5 million in 2006. If Vulcan swaps an asset or 

   ##### 

  

    

business of Florida Rock or Vulcan for an asset or business of a third-party,
or enters into an agreement to effect such a swap, then in determining
whether there has been a material adverse effect on Florida Rocks aggregates
business, to the extent that the EBITDA of the Vulcan or Florida Rock
property so disposed of exceeds the EBITDA of the third party property
received in return, the difference between the EBITDA of such properties shall
be added to the total of disposed EBITDA, and to the extent that the EBITDA
of the Vulcan or Florida Rock property so disposed of is less than the EBITDA
of the third party property received in return, the difference between the
EBITDA of such properties shall be subtracted from the total of disposed
EBITDA. If Vulcan sells or otherwise disposes of a Vulcan asset or business
pursuant to Section 5.3 (other than swaps, which shall be treated as
above), then the EBITDA for the corresponding asset or business of Florida
Rock that is closest to the Vulcan asset or business so sold or disposed of
shall be considered for purposes of determining whether there has been a
material adverse effect on Florida Rocks aggregates business.

   ##### 

  

    

such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Holdco, as the case may be, shall assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 5.11. 

  

 (g) The provisions of this Section 5.11 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Florida Rock Indemnified Party and Vulcan Indemnified Party and their respective heirs and representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise.

Vulcan and Florida Rock shall use reasonable best efforts (i) to develop a joint communications plan, (ii) to ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint communications plan, and (iii) except in respect of any announcement required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange in which it is impracticable to consult with each other as contemplated by this clause (iii), to consult with each other before issuing any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 5.13. _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest Holdco or the surviving corporation of the Mergers with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either of the constituent corporations of the Vulcan Merger and the Florida Rock Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall take all such necessary action.

 (b) _Performance of Obligations of Vulcan_.

Florida Rock shall have received the opinion of its counsel, Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Florida Rock, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the exchange of Florida Rock Common Stock and Vulcan Common Stock for Holdco Common Stock pursuant to the Mergers, taken together, will be treated for Federal income tax purposes as an exchange described in Section 351 of the Code. In rendering such opinion, counsel to Florida Rock shall be entitled to rely upon customary representations and assumptions provided by Holdco, Vulcan, Florida Rock and others that counsel to Florida Rock reasonably deems relevant. 

  

ARTICLE VII

 (a) by mutual consent of Vulcan and Florida Rock in a written instrument; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) by either Vulcan or Florida Rock, upon written notice to the other party, if a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction that must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of either Merger and such denial has become final and non-appealable; or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting either Merger, and such order, decree, ruling or other action has become final and non-appealable; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose failure to comply with Section 5.3 or any other provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, such action; 

  

 (c) by either Vulcan or Florida Rock, upon written notice to the other party, if both Mergers shall not have been consummated on or before November 19, 2007; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to any party whose failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such date; 

  

 (d) by Vulcan, upon written notice to Florida Rock, if Florida Rock shall have: (i) failed to make the Florida Rock Recommendation or effected a Change in Florida Rock Recommendation (or resolved to take any such action) that is adverse to Vulcan in any material respect, whether or not permitted by the terms hereof, (ii) breached its obligations under this Agreement by reason of a failure to call the Florida Rock Shareholders Meeting in accordance with Section 5.1(b) or a failure to prepare and mail to its shareholders the Proxy Statement/Prospectus in accordance with Section 5.1(a), or (iii) breached its obligations under Section 5.4 in any material respect; 

  

 (e) by either Vulcan or Florida Rock, upon written notice to the other party, if there shall have been a breach by the other party of any of the covenants or agreements, or failure to be true of any of the representations or warranties, set forth in this Agreement on the part of such other party, which breach, or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or (b) or Section 6.3(a) or (b), as the case may be, and which breach, or failure to be true, has not been cured within 30 days following written notice thereof to the affected party or, by its nature, cannot be cured within such time period; or 

  

 (f) by either Vulcan or Florida Rock, if the Required Florida Rock Vote shall not have been obtained upon a vote taken thereon at the duly convened Florida Rock Shareholders Meeting. 

  

 7.2. _Effect of Termination_. (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Florida Rock or Vulcan as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void, and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Vulcan or Florida Rock or their respective officers or directors, except with respect to Section 5.2 (Access to Information; Confidentiality), Section 5.9 (Fees and Expenses), this Section 7.2 (Effect of Termination), and Article VIII (General Provisions), which shall survive such termination and except that no party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful and material breach of this Agreement.

 If Florida Rock fails to pay all amounts due to Vulcan on the dates specified, then Florida Rock shall pay all costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by Vulcan in connection with any action or proceeding (including the filing of any lawsuit) taken by it to collect such unpaid amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as published in the _Wall Street Journal_ , from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date actually received by Vulcan. 

  

 7.3. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with this Agreement by the shareholders of Florida Rock, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by such shareholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. 

  

 7.4. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of Directors, may, to the extent permitted by

applicable law, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of a party to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights. No single or partial exercise of any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege. Any waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and
for the specific purpose for which given and shall not constitute a waiver to
any subsequent or other exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder.

 8.3. _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

The phrases "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and words of similar import shall be deemed to refer to this Agreement as a whole, including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word "or" shall be inclusive and not exclusive. Any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms.

 8.4. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and this Agreement shall become effective when a counterpart signed by each party shall be delivered to the other party, it being understood that both parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

   ##### 

  

  

 8.5. _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to herein) (a) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement in accordance with their terms and (b) except as provided in Sections 5.10 and 5.11 (which are intended for the benefit of only the persons specifically named therein), is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties any rights or remedies hereunder. 

  

 8.6. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, except that the FBCA shall apply to the Florida Rock Merger and NJBCA shall apply to the Vulcan Merger. 

  

 8.7. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and, unless the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability would prevent the parties from realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of the Mergers that they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, shall not render invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affect the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. 

  

 8.8. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of the parties hereunder shall be assigned by either party (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void.

Each party agrees to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating hereto either in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or, if such suit, action or other proceeding may not be brought in such court for reasons of subject matter jurisdiction, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby in (i) the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, or (ii) the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party further irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such suit, action or other proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by mail to such party at its address set forth in this Agreement, such service of process to be effective upon acknowledgment of receipt of such registered mail; 

   ##### 

  

    

 _provided_ that nothing in this Section 8.9 shall affect the right of any
party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. The
consent to jurisdiction set forth in this Section 8.9 shall not constitute a
general consent to service of process in the State of New York and shall have
no effect for any purpose except as provided in this Section 8.9. The parties
agree that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by law. 

  

 8.10. _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court identified in the Section above, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  

 8.11. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY INVOLVING ANY MATTERS (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
