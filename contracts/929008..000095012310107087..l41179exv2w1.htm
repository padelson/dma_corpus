 6.3. _Employees_. 

  

 6.3.1. _Employee Benefit Plans_. 

    

 6.3.1.1. In addition to the Palisades Associates, Inc. and Affiliates 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan dated January 1, 2010 (" _Seller s 401(k) Plan_"),  _Schedule 6.3.1_ identifies the following categories of Company Plans: (i) those which are sponsored by the Company or an Affiliate and which will be continued by the Company after the Closing Date (" _Continued Plans_ "); (ii) those which are sponsored by the Company or an Affiliate but which will not be continued by the Company after the Closing Date (" _Discontinued Plans_ "); and (iii) those which are sponsored by Seller or an entity other than the Company or an Affiliate and in which the Company will participate through the Applicable Benefit Changeover Date as hereinafter defined (" _Multiple Employer Plans_ "). 

   

 6.3.1.2. With respect to each Company Plan identified as a Continued Plan, effective as of the Closing Date, Seller shall, and/or shall cause the Company to, transfer, terminate or otherwise remove from participation in any such Continued Plan any person participating in any such Continued Plan who 

    ##### 

 

    

will not be a Continued Employee (defined below) (or the covered
spouse, domestic partner, child or dependent of a Continued Employee) of the
Company after the Closing Date (a " _Retained Employee_ "). None of the
Company, its Subsidiaries, Buyer nor any of each of their Affiliates shall
have any liability under the Continued Plans with respect to any such
Retained Employee; which liability shall be retained by Seller. Nothing in
this Agreement shall obligate Buyer to continue the Continued Plans for any
period of time after the Closing Date or restrict Buyers ability to amend,
merge, terminate or otherwise modify the terms and conditions of any such
Continued Plan immediately following the Closing Date or, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, otherwise modify the employee benefit programs
provided to any Company employee that is employed immediately following the
Closing Date (a " _Continued Employee_ "). Notwithstanding anything contained
in this _Section 6.3.1.2_ to the contrary, Buyer shall be responsible for
continuation of group health, dental or vision coverage under Code Section
4980B of the Code (or state law counterpart) for any qualified
beneficiary (as defined at Section 4980B(g)(1) of the Code) who was or is an
employee of the Company or an Affiliate (or the covered spouse, domestic
partner, child or dependent of such employee) when the qualifying event (as
defined at Section 4980B(f)(3)) occurred, whether such event occurred or
occurs before, on or after the Closing Date. 

   

 6.3.1.3. With respect to Sellers 401(k) Plan, Seller shall, or shall cause the Company to, adopt such resolutions and take such further corporate action as may be necessary or appropriate to freeze participation in such plan with respect to all current or former Company employees, terminate the Companys participation as a participating employer in the Sellers 401(k) Plan and separately account or cause the plans third party administrator to separately account for the assets and liabilities under Sellers 401(k) Plan attributable to participants who are current or former employees of the Company, and provide that the account balances of those participants in Sellers 401(k) Plan who become Continued Employees will be fully vested and non-forfeitable. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to effect a direct, trustee to trustee, transfer of such segregated assets and liabilities to the similar pension plan of Buyer (" _Buyer s 401(k) Plan_"), as soon as administratively feasible after the Closing Date. It is the parties intention that the direct, trustee to trustee, transfer of the account balances from the Sellers 401(k) Plan to the Buyers 401(k) Plan shall be in accordance with the requirements of all applicable law and that the provisions of this section be interpreted consistent with such requirements. Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate with, and provide reasonable assistance to, one another in their fulfillment of the mutual duties and obligations created by this section. 

   

 6.3.1.4. With respect to each Company Plan identified as a Discontinued Plan, effective as of the Closing Date, Seller shall, and/or shall cause the Company to: (i) terminate such Discontinued Plan, (ii) withdraw from participating in any Discontinued Plan, (iii) transfer sponsorship of each Discontinued Plan to an entity other than the Company or a Subsidiary or (iv) perform any combination of the foregoing, so that the Discontinued Plans shall be 

   ##### 

  

    

retained by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller on and after the Closing Date
and no Continued Employee is eligible to actively participate in any
Discontinued Plan after the Closing Date. None of the Company, its
Subsidiaries, Buyer nor any of each of their Affiliates shall have any
liability with respect to any Discontinued Plans, including by way
of clarification and not limitation, claims incurred but not reported prior
to the Closing Date; which liability shall be retained by Seller. 

   

 6.3.1.5. With respect to each Company Plan identified as a Multiple Employer Plan, Seller shall cause such Multiple Employer Plan to continue to cover Continued Employees for the period commencing on the Closing Date and continuing through to the Applicable Benefit Changeover Date under the same terms and conditions as in effect prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall reimburse Seller for the actual cost of such continued coverage, including without limitation all premium costs and administrative costs on a pro-rata basis. Seller shall take such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the withdrawal of the Company from each such Multiple Employer Plan as of the Applicable Benefit Changeover Date such that the Company shall cease to be a participating employer in such Multiple Employer Plan and no Continued Employee is eligible to actively participate in any such Multiple Employer Plan after the Applicable Benefit Changeover Date. None of the Company, its Subsidiaries, Buyer nor any of each of their Affiliates shall have any liability with respect to any Multiple Employer Plans, including by way of clarification and not limitation, claims incurred but not reported prior to the Applicable Benefit Changeover Date; which liability shall be retained by Seller. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Applicable Benefit Changeover Date_ " with respect to any component plan included within the category of "Multiple Employer Plan" shall be the later of December 31, 2010 or such date as may be mutually agreeable to the parties. 

   

 6.3.2. From the Closing Date until at least one (1) year following the Closing Date, each Continued Employee shall be entitled to (a) a base salary and bonus opportunity at the same level or greater than such employees base salary and bonus and commission opportunity as in effect on the Closing Date and (b) other employee benefits and other terms and conditions of employment that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those being provided to such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. Upon or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall pay (i) all holiday or similar bonuses with respect to the 2010 calendar year to each Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) all amounts payable under the Project Keystone Success Bonus Plan upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company will take such action, if any, that may be required to assure that no employee of the Company will be permitted to carryover accrued and unused vacation time to calendar year 2011 in excess of five (5) days and the cost of any such carryover shall be the responsibility of the Buyer. 

   

 6.3.3. With respect to any employee benefit plan, program or policy that is made available to Continued Employee after the Closing Date: (a) all periods of service with the Company, or any predecessor entity thereto, by any such employee prior to the Closing Date shall be credited for eligibility, participation and vesting purposes under 

   ##### 

  

    

such plan, program or policy and for purposes of calculating benefits under
any severance, sick leave or vacation plans, and (b) with respect to any
Welfare Plans to which such Continued Employees may become eligible, Buyer
shall take all commercially reasonable steps necessary to cause such plans to
provide credit for the year in which the Closing Date occurs for any co-
payments or deductibles and maximum out-of-pocket payments by such Continued
Employees and to waive all pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting
periods, other than limitations or waiting periods that had not been
satisfied, under corresponding Company Plans prior to the Closing Date. Buyer
shall recognize vacation days previously accrued and reserved for by the
Company through the Closing Date subject to the limitation set forth in the
last sentence of _Section 6.3.2_. 

   

 6.3.4. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.3_, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person not a party hereto any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any right to employment or continued employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to a particular term or condition of employment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement is intended to, or does, constitute the establishment of, or an amendment to, any Employee Plan or any employee benefit plan of Buyer or its Affiliates. 

   

 6.3.5. On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller and the Company shall use their reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in obtaining (a) executed employment agreements, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Buyer, with each of Jerry Allen, Randall Harmon, William Reed, Arthur Liebenthal, Bruce Riesman, John Witmer, Stephen Quinn, Luc Morisette, Paul Joong, Ken Olsen, James Manari, Frank McCullough, Matt Hartman and Raul Soto, or (b) acknowledgments, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Buyer, from any other employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that have change in control agreements or other Contractual Obligations that provide for severance or termination payments, or for the acceleration of the time or vesting of any payment, upon a change in control of the Company to the effect that the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and the continued employment by such employee by the Company or its Subsidiaries in the manner contemplated by Buyer will not give rise, individually or together, to "good reason", constructive termination, without cause termination or any other equivalent basis that would give rise to payment under any such Contractual Obligations. 

   

 6.3.6. Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company to (a) accept the resignations provided to Buyer pursuant to _Section 2.4.2(b)_ and (b) appoint or elect new officers, directors or members as is required for compliance with the applicable Legal Requirements after giving effect to such resignations. Seller and, except with respect to actions taken in his or her capacity as a director or an officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable (other than actions taken in furtherance of his or her resignations), each of the individuals resigning pursuant to  _Section 2.4.2(b)_, shall have no liability and Buyer shall not make any claim for indemnification, related to or arising out of Buyers failure to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to appoint or elect new officers, directors or members in compliance with the 

   ##### 

  

    

applicable Legal Requirements or otherwise fail to make such individuals
resignations effective as of the Effective Date. 

  

 6.4. _Further Assurances_. Each party, upon the request from time to time of any other party hereto after the Closing, and at the expense of the requesting party but without further consideration, shall take such actions as may be necessary or reasonably requested to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement in an orderly fashion. 

  

 6.5. _Access to Properties and Records_. The Company shall permit Parent and its directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers and other appropriate Representatives to have reasonable access, prior to the Closing Date, to the employees, properties and books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, during normal working hours and upon reasonable notice, to familiarize itself with the Companys respective properties, business and operating and financial conditions or, at the option of Parent or Buyer, to perform site visits or Phase 1 environmental studies (which in no event will involve any sampling or analysis of any environmental media and neither Parent nor any of its Representatives may perform any Phase II environmental testing, test borings or other physical samplings of any of the Real Property without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent the Company may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion), _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and its Representatives shall not unreasonably disrupt the personnel and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. In no way limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and Seller shall cause the Company to, provide Buyer with all information reasonably requested in connection with the pledge of certain of the Assets by Buyer following the Closing Date as additional collateral under Buyers or its Affiliates existing credit facilities, including information regarding Accounts Receivable aging and customer credit histories. All information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement dated August 19, 2010 between the Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). 

  

 6.6. _Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees_. 

   

 6.6.1. For a period of six years after the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries Organizational Documents relating to the exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses of any officers and directors (unless required by law), it being the intent of the parties that the officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries who served prior to Closing shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses to the full extent of the law. 

   

 6.6.2. If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their respective successors or assigns) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that such successors and assigns assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.6_. This  _Section 6.6_ shall be for the benefit of, and shall be Enforceable by, the directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and their respective heirs and estates, and such parties shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement for such purposes. 

   ##### 

  

   

 6.6.3. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall maintain through the Closing Date their existing directors and officers insurance, professional liability insurance and employment practices liability insurance in full force and effect without reduction of coverage and shall, prior to the Closing, obtain extended reporting period coverage under such policies (to be effective as of the Closing and for a period of six years thereafter) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof. 

  

 6.7. _Access to Records After Closing_. For a period of five years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Company to provide Seller (or, if applicable, a Person designated by Seller in a notice to Buyer in accordance with _Section 12.6_ (" _Seller Designee_ ")) and each of its authorized Representatives with reasonable access to all of the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent that such access may reasonably be required by such parties in connection with matters relating to or affected by the operations of the Company prior to the Closing Date. Such access shall be afforded by the Company upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller, any Seller Designee or any of Sellers its Representatives shall not unreasonably disrupt the personnel and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall desire to dispose of any such books and records prior to the expiration of such five-year period, the Company shall, prior to such disposition, notify Seller and give Seller (or, if applicable, Seller Designee) and its authorized Representatives a reasonable opportunity, at Sellers or Seller Designees expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as such parties may select at the sole cost and expense of Seller. 

  

 6.8. _Privilege; Waiver of Conflicts_. Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (which, for this purpose, shall be deemed after the Closing to include the Company and its Subsidiaries) hereby (a) agrees that, notwithstanding any current or prior representation of the Company or its Subsidiaries by Ropes and Gray LLP (" _Prior Company Counsel_ "), Prior Company Counsel shall be allowed to represent the Seller and its Affiliates (other than, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) in any matters and disputes that arise under or relate to this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) waives any claim that Parent, Buyer, the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries has or may have that Prior Company Counsel has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation, (c) agrees that, if a dispute arises after the Closing between Parent, Buyer, the Company, or any of the Companys Subsidiaries on the one hand, and the Seller or any of the Sellers other Affiliates on the other hand, then Prior Company Counsel may represent the Seller and its other Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of the Seller and such other Affiliates may be directly adverse to Parent, Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries and even though Prior Company Counsel may have represented the Company and its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute or may be handling ongoing matters for the Company and its Affiliates and (d) agrees that, as to all communications between or among Prior Company Counsel and the Seller, the Company or its Subsidiaries (with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, solely prior to the Closing) and/or any of their respective Affiliates that relate in any way to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, the attorney-client privilege 

   ##### 

  

    

and the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Seller and may be
controlled by the Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed or disputed by
Parent, Buyer, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries; _provided_ that
nothing herein is intended or shall be construed to constitute an agreement
by the Seller or the Company to waive any privilege of the Company or its
Subsidiaries with respect to any information or communication that does not
relate to any dispute under or relating to this Agreement and/or the
transactions contemplated hereby (it being understood that any privilege of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that attaches with respect to such
other matters will be controlled solely by the Company after the Closing).
Also, if a dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries on the one hand, and any third party other than the Seller
and its Affiliates on the other hand, then the Company may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure to such third party of
confidential communications by Prior Company Counsel;  _provided_ , _however_
, that to the extent such privilege relates in any way to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company may not waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Each of Parent and Buyer
acknowledges on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (which, for this purpose,
shall be deemed after the Closing to include the Company and
its Subsidiaries) that it has had the opportunity to discuss and obtain
adequate information concerning the significance and material risks of, and
reasonable available alternatives to, the waivers, permissions and other
provisions of this _Section 6.8_, including without limitation
the opportunity to consult with independent counsel of its choice. 

  

 6.9. _Insurance Recoveries_. If, and to the extent, the Seller or the Company obtains any insurance proceeds from any Insurance Policies with respect to any loss of or damages to any Assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries (other than assets of the types included in the calculation of Adjusted Working Capital) that occurs from and after the date hereof and prior to the Closing, to the extent such proceeds are not used to repair, replace or restore such Assets prior to Closing, then such proceeds shall be retained by the Company and shall not be included in the calculation of the Closing Cash Amount (or Adjusted Closing Cash Amount) and to the extent any insurance policy deductible applies to any claim for such loss or damage to such Assets in such period the aggregate amount of such deductibles borne by the Company (the " _Deductible Portion of Specified Insured Losses_ ") shall be recoverable from the Escrow Amount as an indemnifiable Loss pursuant to Section 9.1.5 (subject, without duplication, to the Deductible set forth in Section 9.4.1).

Such notification shall be given promptly upon receipt by the Indemnified Party of notice of such Third Party Claim, and shall describe in reasonable detail (to the extent known by the Indemnified Party) the facts constituting the basis for such Third Party Claim and the amount of the claimed Losses; _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay or failure on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party shall limit any liability or obligation for indemnification pursuant to this _Section 9_ except to the extent of any damage or liability caused by or arising out of such delay or failure. Within fifteen (15) calendar days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not so assume control of the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall control such defense.

The party controlling the defense of the Third Party Claim (the " _Controlling Party_ ") shall keep the Non-controlling Party advised of the status of such Third Party Claim and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party with respect thereto. The Non-controlling Party shall furnish the Controlling Party with such information as it may have with respect to such Third Party Claim (including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have been served on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall otherwise cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of such Third Party Claim.

any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Non-
controlling Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, claims relating to
Taxes shall not be governed by _Section 9.5.1_ or _Section 9.5.2_ and shall
be governed instead by _Section 9.6_. 

   

 9.5.2. In order to seek indemnification under this _Section 9_ (other than in respect of Third Party Claims which shall be governed by _Section 9.5.1_), an Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party and a copy of such Claim Notice to the Escrow Agent. Such Claim Notice shall be delivered by the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) calendar days after the Indemnified Party learns of the claim and shall describe in reasonable detail the facts constituting the basis for such claim and the Claim Amount; _provided_ , no delay or failure on the part of an Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party shall limit any liability or obligation for indemnification pursuant to this _Section 9_, except to the extent of any damage or liability caused by or arising out of such delay or failure. 

  

 9.6. _Tax Matters_. 

   

 9.6.1. The parties hereto agree that it is their intent that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a purchase of the Companys assets and each Subsidiarys assets, and each of Parent, Buyer, Company, and Seller, shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such intended treatment, unless otherwise required by law. 

   

 9.6.2. Neither Buyer nor any Affiliate shall make or cause or allow to be made any election under any foreign law equivalent to an election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the Subsidiaries without Sellers prior written consent, and Buyer and its Affiliates shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates, and any direct and indirect beneficial owners from any Losses resulting from such an election. 

   

 9.6.3. The Buyer shall prepare an allocation of the purchase price (as determined for tax purposes) among the Companys assets and each Subsidiarys assets as of immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Purchase Price Allocation_ "). For this purpose, assets shall be valued consistently, to the extent applicable and permitted by Law, with the valuations used for purposes of the calculation of Adjusted Working Capital. Buyer shall, no later than sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing Date (or, if later, promptly after the finalization of Adjusted Working Capital), provide the Purchase Price Allocation to Seller for Sellers review and approval. If the parties cannot agree on the Purchase Price Allocation after negotiating in good faith, any disputes shall be submitted to the Arbitrator to be resolved in accordance with the principles of this _Section 9.6.3_ and _Section 2.5.5_. Each of Parent, Buyer, Company, and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, file all Tax Returns consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation as finally agreed to by the parties or as determined by the Arbitrator (the " _Final Purchase Price Allocation_ "), and none of them shall take a position in any Tax proceeding contrary to the Final Purchase Price Allocation unless otherwise required by law.

Such notice shall describe the Tax Proceeding in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notices and other documents received from any taxing authority in respect of such Tax Proceeding. Seller (or, if applicable, Seller Designee) shall have the right, at its election, to control such Tax Proceeding (including any court proceeding following an audit or examination); provided, however, that Seller (or, if applicable, Seller Designee) may not settle any issues raised in such Tax Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such settlement could affect the Tax liability of the Company or any Affiliate for a post-Closing period. If Seller (or, if applicable, Seller Designee) does not elect to control any such Tax Proceeding, then Buyer may control such Tax Proceeding; provided, however, that Buyer shall keep Seller (or, if applicable, Seller Designee) informed of the status of the Tax Proceeding, including by advance notification to Seller (or, if applicable, Seller Designee) of any scheduled meetings or phone calls and of any submissions to any taxing authority or court, and Seller (or, if applicable, Seller Designee) may at its option participate in the Tax Proceeding at its own expense; and provided, further, that Buyer may not settle any issues raised in any Tax Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Seller (or, if applicable, Seller Designee) which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. 

   

 9.6.6. The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared consistent with the Companys past practice, and shall duly and timely file or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are required to be filed after the Closing Date for Pre-Closing Tax Periods. The parties agree that any Tax deductions attributable to compensation payments and any other compensation events made or that occur on or prior to the Closing Date will be allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and will be 

   ##### 

  

   

taken on Sellers Tax Returns to the extent permitted by Law. Company shall
deliver any such Tax Returns to Seller (or, if applicable, Seller Designee)
for its review at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the filing thereof
and Company shall make any changes to such Tax Returns that are reasonably
requested by Seller (or, if applicable, Seller Designee); provided, however,
that if the Company and Seller (or, if applicable, Seller Designee) cannot
resolve any dispute regarding any requested change, the dispute shall be
submitted to a mutually acceptable independent accounting firm for resolution
(in a manner consistent with the Companys past practice, except to the
extent otherwise required by law) and the Tax Returns shall be filed
consistent with such resolution. 

   

 9.6.7. Parent shall not amend and shall not permit any of its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date) to amend any Tax Return of the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to a taxable period ending on or prior to, or that includes, the Closing Date, or file a ruling request, initiate any audit or investigation or otherwise seek administrative guidance (on a named or no-names basis) with respect to such taxable periods without the prior written consent of Seller (or, if applicable, Seller Designee) unless otherwise expressly required by law. 

   

 9.6.8. The parties hereto shall provide such information as the other party hereto may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of such partys Tax Returns, or to respond to or contest any audit or claim or otherwise satisfy any Legal Requirement relating to Taxes of each party hereto or their respective Affiliates, including provision of powers of attorney to control a Tax Proceeding in a manner consistent with this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, no later than February 10, 2011 Buyer or the Company shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to Seller all information with respect to the Company and the Business (calculated and provided in a form consistent with the Companys past practice) necessary for Seller and its beneficial owners to prepare their respective 2010 Tax Returns. Buyer and Parent agree to use commercially reasonable efforts (a) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by any party, any extensions thereof) applicable to such taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (b) to give the Seller reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, upon request, to transfer to the other party possession of such books and records. 

   

 9.6.9. Any refund, credit or reduction of Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including any interest thereon, with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, including any overpayments of estimated Taxes or other prepayments of Tax, will be for the account of the Seller, and will be promptly paid to the Seller by Purchaser or the Company, as applicable, within ten (10) Business Days after any such refund, credit, reduction or overpayment, or interest thereon, is received by, or reduces Taxes otherwise due and payable by, Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that no payment under this Section 9.6.9 shall be made to Seller with regard to any refund, credit or reduction of Taxes (and any interest thereon) (a) which was included in the calculation of Adjusted Working Capital, as finally 

   ##### 

  

   

determined pursuant to _Section 2.5_, (b) which was the result of the
carry back of a taxable loss or other Tax attribute from a post-Closing tax
period (or portion thereof), (c) which was the result of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries becoming a part of Parents consolidated group following
the Closing, or (d) to the extent that any Buyer Indemnified Party would be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1.3 but is unable to
receive such indemnification payment because of the limitation in
_Section 9.4.1(a)_ or because of the expiration of the survival period under
_Section 9.3_. Purchaser and the Company and its Subsidiaries will cooperate
in obtaining such refunds, overpayments, credits or reduction in Tax
liability, including through the filing of amended Tax Returns or refund
claims, at the reasonable request of the Seller, and at the Sellers expense.
For purposes of this Section 9.6.9, any refund of Taxes, including any
interest thereon, for a Tax period that includes, but does not end on, the
Closing Date will be allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period based on the
number of days in the portion of the Tax period ending on and including the
Closing Date as a percentage of the total number of days in the Tax period. 

  

 9.7. _Uncollectible Accounts Receivable_. 

   

 9.7.1. Following the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to collect all of the Accounts Receivable of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Accounts Receivable_ "); and (b) apply payments received from each customer of the Business first to the Closing Date Accounts Receivable of such customer (to the extent that such customer had a Closing Date Accounts Receivable) except to the extent that such customer is disputing all or any portion of such Closing Date Accounts Receivable. 

   

 9.7.2. If the Buyer determines in good faith that notwithstanding the actions taken in accordance with Section 9.7.1 there are, as of the 180th day after the Closing Date, still uncollectible Closing Date Accounts Receivable in excess of the Closing Date reserves (taken as a whole) for Closing Date Accounts Receivable reflected in the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet, and the Buyer decides that it wants to pursue recovery from the Escrow Amount as contemplated by Section 9.1.6 and this Section 9.7, then the Buyer will provide the Seller with written notice (" _Accounts Receivable Notice_ ") on or prior to the 195th day following the Closing Date (or, if such 195th day is not a Business Day then on the next Business Day following such 195th day) setting forth in reasonable detail the amount of such excess (the " _Proposed Excess Uncollectible A/R Amount_ ") and the basis for such determination and shall include copies of invoices or other similar documentation for each relevant customer providing details of the account and uncollected amount, and the Buyer shall at all times provide the Seller and its Representatives with reasonable access to the personnel, books, records, documents and other information of the Company and the Seller in connection with Closing Date Accounts Receivable and any and all available information with respect to the collection thereof. The Proposed Excess Uncollectible A/R Amount will be final conclusive and binding on the parties unless the Seller provides a written notice (" _Excess A/R Dispute Notice_ ") no later than ten (10) calendar days after delivery of the Accounts Receivable Notice to Seller. If Buyer and Seller cannot agree on any items raised in the Excess A/R Dispute Notice within ten (10) calendar days after Buyers receipt of the Excess A/R 

   ##### 

  

   

Dispute Notice from Seller, the parties will submit their final calculations
of items in dispute to an Arbitrator chosen in accordance with the procedure
set forth in _Section 2.5_ with respect to the selection of an Arbitrator for
purchase price adjustment provisions under this Agreement. The Proposed
Excess Uncollectible A/R Amount, as adjusted to reflect any changes agreed to
by the parties and the decision of the Arbitrator, if applicable, are
referred to herein as the " _Final Assigned A/R Amount_ ". 

   

 9.7.3. Buyer shall cause the Company to promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the determination of the Final Assigned A/R Amount) assign to the Seller, free and clear of all Liens, all right, title and interest in each of the accounts receivable that contribute to or constitute any portion of the Final Assigned A/R Amount upon receipt of (and only to the extent of) a corresponding amount of the Indemnification Escrow Cash, pursuant to one or more instruments of assignments reasonably satisfactory to Seller, whereupon Seller shall be free to take any and all actions to collect for its own account any and all such accounts receivable.

 10.1. _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each party to this Agreement, by its execution hereof, (a) hereby irrevocably submits, and agrees to cause each of its Subsidiaries to submit, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any New York state or U.S. federal court located in the State of New York, United States of America, for the purpose of any action, claim, cause of action or suit (in contract, tort or otherwise), inquiry proceeding or investigation arising out of or based upon this Agreement or relating to the subject matter hereof, (b) hereby waives, and agrees to cause each of its Subsidiaries to waive, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Legal Requirement, and agrees not to assert, and agrees not to allow any of its Subsidiaries to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that any such proceeding brought in one of the above-named courts is improper, or that this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, or the subject matter of such agreements may not be enforced in or by such court and (c) hereby agrees not to commence or to permit any of its Subsidiaries to commence any action, claim, cause of action or suit (in contract, tort or otherwise), inquiry, proceeding or investigation arising out of or based upon this Agreement or relating to the subject matter hereof other than before one of the above-named courts nor to make any motion or take any other action seeking or intending to cause the transfer or removal of any such action, claim, cause of action or suit (in contract, tort or otherwise), inquiry, proceeding or investigation to any court other than one of the above-named courts whether on the grounds of inconvenient forum or otherwise. Each party hereby consents to service of process in any such proceeding in any manner permitted by New York law, and agrees that service of process by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at its address specified pursuant to  _Section_   _12.6_ is reasonably calculated to give actual notice. 

  

 10.2. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, AND AGREES TO CAUSE EACH OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO WAIVE, AND COVENANTS THAT NEITHER IT NOR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES SHALL ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO

   ##### 

  

   

condition set forth in _Section 7_, in the case of Buyer and Parent, or
