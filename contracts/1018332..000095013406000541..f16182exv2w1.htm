ARTICLE 2 

   

THE MERGER  

  

 2.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION").

Subject to termination of this Agreement as provided in Article 7, the Closing shall take place at the offices of L-1 Investment Partners LLC ("L-1"), 177 Broad Street, Stamford, Connecticut, on the Closing Date. The parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated on the Closing Date by filing the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State in accordance with Delaware Law. 

  

 2.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and upon the Effective Time: 

  

 (a) the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation of the Merger pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Certificate of Merger; 

   

 (b) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to be identical to the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such Certificate of Incorporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time, Article 1 of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is "Identix Incorporated". 

   

 (c) the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time until thereafter   ##### 

  

  

  

amended inaccordance with Delaware Law and as provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws; 

   

 (d) the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue as the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly appointed; 

   

 (e) the members of the Board of Directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be appointed as the members of the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified; and 

   

 (f) the Merger shall, from and after the Effective Time, have all of the effects provided by Delaware Law. 

   

 2.4 _Conversion of Stock_. 

  

 As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the holders of any outstanding shares of capital stock or securities of the Company or Merger Sub: 

  

 (a) Each share of the Company Common Stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.4(c)), shall be automatically converted into the right to receive 0.473 (the "EXCHANGE RATIO") of a fully paid and nonassessable share of Parent Common Stock (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION"). All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any such shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock have been converted. 

   

 (b) Each holder of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive (i) a certificate (or direct registration) representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock payable with respect to such Company Common Stock, and (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.4(f), without interest. 

   

 (c) Each share of Company Common Stock held of record immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company, Merger Sub, Parent shall be canceled and extinguished without any consideration paid thereof. 

   

 (d) Each share of Common Stock, $0.01 per share par value, of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, $0.01 per share par value, of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of a number of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed to evidence   ##### 

  

  

   

ownership of the same number of shares of Common Stock, $0.01 per share par
value, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (e) Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, the Exchange Ratio and Exchange Quotient shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), extraordinary dividend or distribution, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring or having a record date or an effective date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (f) No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger. Instead, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled by virtue of the Merger to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock which otherwise would be received by such holder) shall receive in lieu thereof from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent, with .5 being rounded up) equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) $8.50. 

   

 (g) For the purposes of this Agreement, the "EXCHANGE MULTIPLE" of any quantity means the product obtained from multiplying such quantity by the Exchange Ratio, and the "EXCHANGE QUOTIENT" of any quantity means the quotient obtained from dividing such quantity by the Exchange Ratio. 

   

 2.5 _Company Options, Company Warrants, Company Stock Purchase Plan_. 

  

 (a) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, to the full extent permitted by Applicable Law and the terms of the Company Option Plans, assume all of the Company Options and the Company Option Plans. Each Company Option, whether or not exercisable at the Effective Time, shall be assumed by Parent in such a manner that after the Effective Time it shall be exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as under the Company Option Plan pursuant to which it was granted and the applicable option agreement issued thereunder (after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting resulting from the Merger on the terms provided under the Company Option Plan pursuant to which it was granted and the applicable option agreement issued thereunder); provided, however, that (i) each such option thereafter shall be exercisable for a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the Exchange Multiple of the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such option, and (ii) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock thereafter shall equal the Exchange Quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) of the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Company Options that vest according to their terms as of the Effective Time shall be vested from and after the Effective Time. It is intended that Company Options assumed by Parent shall to the extent permitted by the Code qualify following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent Company Options qualified as incentive stock options immediately prior to the Effective Time and the provisions of this Section 2.5 shall be applied consistent with such intent.   ##### 

  

  

   

 (b) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, assume all warrants of Company outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "COMPANY WARRANTS"). Each Company Warrant, whether or not exercisable at the Effective Time, shall be assumed by Parent in such a manner that it shall be exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as set forth in the applicable Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting resulting from the Merger on the terms provided under the applicable warrant); provided that (i) each such warrant thereafter shall be exercisable for a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the Exchange Multiple of the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Warrant, and (ii) the strike price per share of Parent Common Stock thereafter shall equal the Exchange Quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) of the strike price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Warrant in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continue in the employ of the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent after the Effective Time shall be eligible for participation in the Parent ESPP in accordance with the terms, provisions and policies thereof. 

   

 2.6 _Company Restricted Shares_. 

  

 Subject to the terms of the Company Option Plans (a correct and complete copy of which has been disclosed and made available to Parent), the shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the conversion of any Company Restricted Shares pursuant to the Merger will continue to be unvested and subject to the same repurchase options, risks of forfeiture or other conditions following the Effective Time, and the certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends noting such repurchase options, risks of forfeiture or other conditions. The Company shall take all actions that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set forth in any Contract governing Company Restricted Shares. 

  

 2.7 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Parent shall select an institution reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the exchange agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") in the Merger and shall enter into an exchange agent agreement with the Exchange Agent reasonably satisfactory to Company. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Fund_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article 2, the shares of Parent Common Stock, and cash in lieu of fractional shares (together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, the "EXCHANGE FUND") issuable pursuant to Section 2.4 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. 

   

 (c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates ("CERTIFICATES") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding   ##### 

  

  

  

shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.4(a), cash in
lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.4(f) and any dividends or
other distributions pursuant to Section 2.4(e), (i) a letter of transmittal
in customary form (that shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
the consideration provided for herein. Upon surrender of Certificates for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by
the Exchange Agent (including any required Form W-9 or Form W-8), the holders
of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
certificates representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
(after aggregating all Certificates surrendered by such holder) into which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.4 (which shall be in
uncertificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is requested or
required by Applicable Law or regulation), a check in the amount of U.S.
dollars in lieu of fractional shares that such holders have the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.4(f) and any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.4(e), and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be
deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to
evidence only the right to receive upon surrender thereof the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.4(a), an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional
shares in accordance with Section 2.4(f) and any dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to Section 2.4(e). No interest will be paid or accrued on
any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or on any
unpaid dividends or distributions payable to holders of Certificates. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate
representing the proper number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
and cash payable in lieu of fractional shares may be issued to a transferee
if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. 

   

 (d) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Merger until the holders of record of such Certificates shall surrender such Certificates. Subject to Applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender, the amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(f) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in respect thereof, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.   ##### 

  

  

   

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates were converted into the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.4(a), cash for fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 2.4(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.4(e); provided, however, that Parent or the Exchange Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of such certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock, cash and other distributions, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

   

 (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the former holders of Company Common Stock for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any such holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with the provisions of this Section 2.7 shall thereafter look only to Parent for the shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(a), any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(f) and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(e), in each case without any interest thereon. 

   

 (g) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If after the Effective Time Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 2. 

   

 (h) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.7, neither the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 2.8 _Tax Consequences and Withholding_. 

  

 (a) _Consequences_. It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Income Tax Regulations.   ##### 

  

  

   

 (b) _Withholding_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any former Company Stockholder such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any other Applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted and withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made. 

   

 2.9 _Further Assurances_. 

  

 If, at any time before or after the Effective Time, the Company or Parent reasonably believes or is advised that any further instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger or to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement at or after the Effective Time, then the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective officers and directors shall execute and deliver all such proper deeds, assignments, instruments and assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger and to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.

 4.7 _Properties_. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (a) has good and valid title to all the properties and assets reflected in the latest audited balance sheet included in the Parent SEC Documents as being owned by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries or acquired after the date thereof that are material to Parents business on a consolidated basis (except properties sold or otherwise disposed of since the date thereof in the ordinary course of business), free and clear of all Encumbrances, except (1) Permitted Encumbrances, (2) such imperfections or irregularities of title, easements, covenants, rights-of-way and other Encumbrances as do not materially impair the continued use of the properties or assets subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business operations at such properties, and (3) mortgages, deeds of trust, security interests or other encumbrances on title related to indebtedness reflected on the consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents, and (b) is the lessee of all leasehold estates reflected in the latest audited 

   ##### 

  

  

financial statements included in the Parent SEC Documents or acquired after
the date thereof that are material to its business on a consolidated basis
(except for leases that have expired by their terms since the date thereof or
been assigned, terminated or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice) and is in possession of the
properties purported to be leased thereunder, and each such lease is valid
without default thereunder by the lessee or, to Parents knowledge, the
lessor.

   

 4.8 _Taxes_. 

  

 (a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries (and any consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate group for tax purposes of which Parent or any such Subsidiary is or has been a member) (i) has properly completed and timely filed all material Returns required to be filed by it, and all such Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects, (ii) has timely paid all material Taxes required to be paid by it for which payment was due, (iii) has established an adequate accrual or reserve in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis for the payment of all material Taxes payable in respect of the periods or portions thereof prior to and through the date of Parent Balance Sheet (which accrual or reserve as of such date is fully reflected on Parent Balance Sheet), and (iv) has no Liability for material Taxes in excess of the amount so paid or accruals or reserves so established except for Taxes subsequent to the date of Parent Balance Sheet incurred in the ordinary course of business. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notification from the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority regarding any material issues that (i) are currently pending before the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing agency or authority (including any sales or use Taxing authority) regarding Parent, or (ii) have been raised by the Internal Revenue Service or other Taxing agency or authority and not yet finally resolved. No material Tax liens are currently in effect against any of the assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries other than liens that arise by operation of law for Taxes not yet due and payable. There is not in effect any waiver by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any statute of limitations with respect to any material Taxes. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any material Tax sharing, Tax indemnity, or Tax allocation agreement nor does Parent or any of its Subsidiaries have any material liability or material potential liability to another party under any such agreement. No claim that has not been resolved has ever been made to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries by an authority in a jurisdiction where Parent or its Subsidiaries do not file Tax Returns that any one of them is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. Parent and its Subsidiaries have withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third party. 

  

 (b) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever been a member of a consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate group of which Parent was not the ultimate parent corporation. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (a) in the two years prior to the Agreement Date or (b) in a distribution that could otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the Merger. Parent is not a U.S. real property holding corporation within the meaning of Code Section 897(c)(2). Parent has made available to the Company or its legal or accounting representative copies of all foreign, 

   ##### 

  

  

federal and state income, franchise, sales and use tax Returns for Parent and
each of its subsidiaries filed for all periods including and after the period
ended December 31, 2001.

   

 (c) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that would reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a transaction described in Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

 4.9 _Intellectual Property_. 

  

 (a) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, (1) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries owns or has the valid right or license to use, and, to the extent that it does any of the following, to develop, make, have made, offer for sale, sell, import, copy, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, license to third parties and/or dispose of (for purposes of this Section 4.9, "USE") all Intellectual Property as currently Used in the conduct of the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries (such Intellectual Property being hereinafter collectively referred to as the "PARENT IP RIGHTS"), and (ii) all such Parent IP Rights are owned or licensed by Parent free of all material liens and Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances). As used in this Agreement, "PARENT-OWNED IP RIGHTS" means Parent IP Rights that are or are purportedly owned or exclusively licensed to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (b) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, neither Parents entry into this Agreement nor the performance of its obligations contemplated hereby shall, in accordance with their terms (1) cause the forfeiture or termination of, or give rise to a right of forfeiture or termination of, any material Contract governing any Parent IP Right, (2) materially impair the right of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to Use any Parent IP Right or portion thereof as currently Used in the conduct of Parents business, or (3) cause any royalties fees or other payments to become payable by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to any third person as a result of the Use of any Parent IP Rights by Parent or cause any existing obligations to pay such royalties, fees or other payments to increase (other than due to increased sales of Parents products or services). 

  

 (c) To the knowledge of Parent, and except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be excepted to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, the Use of any Parent IP Right as currently Used in the conduct of its business does not infringe on or otherwise violate the rights of any third party. There is no pending, or to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, claim or litigation contesting the validity, ownership or right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to exercise any Parent IP Right or which would reasonably be expected to result in the abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability of such Parent IP Rights, nor to the knowledge of Parent as of the Agreement Date, is there any legitimate basis for any such claim. None of the Parent IP Rights is subject to any proceeding or outstanding order, contract or stipulation materially restricting Parents use of the Parent IP Rights in the aggregate. To the knowledge of Parent, and except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, no third party is infringing or otherwise violating any Parent IP Right (other than unlicensed end users of Parents commercially available software products). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, (1) the Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has taken commercially reasonable steps to protect, preserve and maintain the proprietary and confidential rights and trade secrets in the Parent IP Rights and (2) no current or former employee of, or independent contractor who has worked with, the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has any right or interest in any Parent-Owned IP Rights. 

  

 (e) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, all registered Parent-Owned IP Rights are to the knowledge of Parent valid, enforceable and subsisting, and Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent is the record owner thereof. 

  

 (f) Schedule 4.9(f) of the Parent Disclosure Letter lists, as of the Agreement Date, all Contracts pursuant to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries grants a third party exclusive rights under any material Parent IP Rights. 

  

 (g) To the knowledge of Parent, and except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, no event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists, that would reasonably be expected to result in the release by Parent or any escrow agent to any third party of any Parent Source Code. "PARENT SOURCE CODE" means, collectively, any human readable software source code, or any material portion or aspect of the software source code which comprise part of the Parent-Owned IP Rights. 

  

 (h) To the knowledge of Parent, as of the Agreement Date, Schedule 4.9(h) of the Parent Disclosure Letter lists Contracts with government entities, pursuant to which material computer software programs or applications owned or co-owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries were developed or co-developed and licensed and/or assigned to Parent. 

  

 (i) To the knowledge of Parent, Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all their respective obligations pursuant to any Public Software license agreements under which they license-in any material Parent IP Rights, except for such non-compliance that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. 

  

 4.10 _Employment_. 

  

 (a) Parent, each of its Subsidiaries and each ERISA Affiliate is in compliance with all Applicable Law and Contracts relating to each Parent Benefit Arrangement, each Parent Foreign Plan, employment, employment practices, immigration, wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment, including employee compensation matters, except where the failure to so comply would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. 

  

 (b) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, (1) no union organizing effort with respect to employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is underway and (2) there is no labor strike, dispute, slowdown, stoppage or lockout actually pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, 

   ##### 

  

  

threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no
controversies pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, between
Parent or any Subsidiary and any of their respective employees which have, or
would reasonably be expected to result in, an action, suit, proceeding,
claim, arbitration or investigation before any Governmental Authority, and
which individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

   

 (c) To the knowledge of Parent, neither Parent, its Subsidiaries, nor any ERISA Affiliate has at any time since the enactment of ERISA, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA. Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary or current or former ERISA Affiliate currently maintains, sponsors, participates in or contributes to, nor has it ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, or contributed to, any pension plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) that is subject to Title IV of ERISA. To the knowledge of Parent, no "accumulated funding deficiency" (as such term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code) has occurred with respect to any Parent Benefit Arrangement that is not subject to Title IV of ERISA. 

  

 (d) With respect to Parent, any of its Subsidiaries and any ERISA Affiliate, Parent has made available to the Company (1) all employee benefit plans within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA currently contributed to, sponsored by or maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (2) each outstanding loan from Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or an ERISA Affiliate to an employee in excess of $25,000, (3) all stock option, stock purchase, phantom stock, stock appreciation right, supplemental retirement, severance, sabbatical, medical, dental, vision care, disability, employee relocation, cafeteria benefit (Section 125 of the Code), dependent care (Section 129 of the Code), life insurance or accident insurance plans, programs or arrangements (other than Parent Foreign Plans) currently contributed to, sponsored by or maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (4) all bonus, pension, profit sharing, savings, retirement, deferred compensation or incentive plans, programs or arrangements (other than Parent Foreign Plans) currently contributed to, sponsored by or maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (5) other fringe or employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements that apply to senior management and that do not generally apply to all employees that are currently contributed to, sponsored by or maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (6) all employment or service agreements with a current service provider (except for offer letters providing for at-will employment which do not provide for severance, acceleration or post-termination benefits except as required by the law or applicable custom or rule of the relevant jurisdiction outside of the United States) where the obligations under any such agreement are in excess of $100,000 or if any such agreement is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC), and (7) all change of control agreements or severance agreements, written or otherwise, for the benefit of, or relating to, any current director or officer of Parent or any current employee or consultant, in each case in the foregoing clauses (1)-(7) to the extent such plans, loans, programs, arrangements, agreements or other items are material to the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (collectively, the "PARENT BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS"). 

  

 (e) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any Contract with any director or officer of Parent (1) the benefits of which are contingent, or the terms of which are materially altered as a result of the execution of this Agreement, stockholder approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or in connection with any 

   ##### 

  

  

subsequent event(s)), or (2) providing any fixed term of employment. No Parent
Benefit Arrangement will provide benefits that shall be increased, or the
vesting of benefits of which shall be accelerated or the value of any of the
benefits of which shall be calculated as a result of the execution of this
Agreement, stockholder approval of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (whether alone or in connection with any subsequent event(s)).
Except as set forth in Section 4.10(e) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, to
the knowledge of Parent, there is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other
Contract covering any current or former employee or consultant of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliate to which Parent and/or any such
Subsidiary is a party or by which Parent and/or any such Subsidiary is bound
that, considered individually or considered collectively with any other such
agreements, plans, arrangements or other Contracts, will, or could reasonably
be expected to, as a result of the execution of this Agreement, stockholder
approval of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (or any event
subsequent to and in combination with the Merger), result in a payment that
could reasonably be expected to be characterized as a "parachute payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

   

 4.11 _Absence of Certain Changes_. 

  

 Except as set forth in Section 4.11 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, since October 2, 2005, Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has operated its business in all material respects in the ordinary course consistent with its past practices, and since such date there has not been with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, (a) any Effect or Effects that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, (b) declaration, setting aside, making or payment of any dividend or other distribution (whether payable in cash, stock, property or a combination thereof) with respect to any of the capital stock of Parent, (c) reclassification, combination, split or subdivision of any capital stock of Parent, (d) redemption, purchase or other acquisition, directly or indirectly, by Parent of any capital stock, other equity interests or other securities of Parent (other than repurchases of shares in connection with the termination of the employment relationship with any employee), or (e) through the Agreement Date any incurrence of any indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of $100,000 in the aggregate for Parent and its Subsidiaries or issuance of any debt securities or assumption, guarantee or endorsement of the obligations of any Person (other than a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent) for borrowed money (except for indebtedness for borrowed money under or guarantees with respect to indebtedness under any existing credit facility or indebtedness of any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent to any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or indebtedness of Parent to any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent).

 (1) any Contract that is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC); 

   ##### 

  

  

 (2) any Contract under which it has in excess of $100,000 of outstanding indebtedness for money borrowed as of the Agreement Date or guaranteed indebtedness for money borrowed of any Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) in excess of $100,000 as of the Agreement Date; 

  

 (3) any Contract that (i) restricts it from participating or competing in any line of business, market or geographic area, (ii) contains most favored customer pricing provisions, or (iii) grants any exclusive rights, rights of refusal, rights of first negotiation or similar rights to any Person, in each case in a manner which is material to the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; 

  

 (4) any Contract that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or 

  

 (5) any Contract the termination of which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. 

  

A complete and correct copy of each agreement or document required by the
foregoing subsections (1)-(5) of this Section 4.12(a) to be listed on
Schedule 4.12(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter has been made available by
Parent to the Company and its counsel or filed by Parent with the SEC. All
Parent Material Contracts are in written form.

   

 (b) _No Default_. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to Parents knowledge, any counterparty to any Parent Material Contract, has violated any provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would constitute a default under, or give any counterparty the right to exercise any remedy (including the right to a rebate, refund, credit, change in performance schedule, cancellation, termination or modification) pursuant to, the provisions of any Parent Material Contract, except in each case for those violations and defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. 

  

 4.13 _Environmental Matters_. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, (a) the operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries are, and at all times have been, in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws, including possession and compliance with the terms of all Governmental Permits required by Environmental Laws, (b) there are no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, suits, actions, investigations or proceedings under or pursuant to Environmental Laws against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or involving any real property currently or, to the knowledge of Parent, formerly owned, operated or leased or other sites at which Hazardous Materials were disposed of, or allegedly disposed of, by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (c) to Parents knowledge, Parent and its Subsidiaries have received no written allegations of any Liabilities under any Environment Law and Parent has no knowledge or any pending or threatened such allegations, and (d) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has generated, transported, treated, stored, installed, disposed of or released any Hazardous Materials in violation of, or in a manner that would reasonably be expected to give rise to liability to Parent or its Subsidiaries under, any Environmental Laws. 

   ##### 

  

  

 4.14 _Interested Party Transactions_. Since the date of filing with the SEC of the proxy statement for the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Parent, no event has occurred that would be required to be reported as a Certain Relationship or Related Transaction pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.

Assuming the accuracy of the representation and warranty set forth in Section 3.2(f), the action of the Board of Directors of the Company in approving this Agreement, the Company Voting Agreements and the transactions provided for herein and therein is sufficient to render inapplicable to this Agreement, the Company Voting Agreements and the transactions provided for herein and therein the restrictions on "business combinations" (as defined in Section 203 of Delaware Law) as set forth in Section 203 of Delaware Law. 

  

 4.16 _Brokers_. Except for fees payable to Bear Stearns and Co, Inc.

 5.2 _No Solicitation_.

 (b) _Notification_. As promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) after receipt of any Alternative Transaction Proposal or any request for nonpublic 

   ##### 

  

  

information or any inquiry relating in any way to any Alternative Transaction
Proposal, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall provide the other
party with oral and written notice of the material terms and conditions of
such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity
of the Person or group making any such Alternative Transaction Proposal,
request or inquiry and a copy of all written materials provided to it in
connection with such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry. In
addition, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall provide the other
party as promptly as possible with all information as is reasonably necessary
to keep the other party informed in all material respects of all oral or
written communications regarding, and the status and material terms of, any
such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry, and, without
limitation of the other provisions of this Section 5.2, shall promptly
provide to the other party a copy of all written materials (including
written materials provided by email or otherwise in electronic format)
subsequently provided by or to it in connection with such Alternative
Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company or Parent, as the case

Alternative Transaction.

   

 (c) _Superior Proposal_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2(a), in the event that the Company or Parent, as the case may be, receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Alternative Transaction Proposal which is determined to be, or to be reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal, such party or its Board of Directors may then take the following actions (but only (i) if and to the extent that (x) its Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, and (y) the Company or Parent, as the case may be, has given the other party at least two business days prior written notice of its intention to take any of the following actions and of the identity of the Person or group making such Alternative Transaction Proposal and the material terms and conditions of such Alternative Transaction Proposal and (ii) if it shall not have breached in any material respect any of the provisions of this Section 5.2): 

  

 (1) Furnish nonpublic information to the Person or group making such Alternative Transaction Proposal, provided that (A) prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information, it receives from such Person or group an executed confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality terms at least as restrictive as the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of December 28, 2005, between the Company and Parent (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT") and (B) contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person or group, it furnishes such nonpublic information to the other party hereto (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously so furnished to such party); and 

  

 (2) Engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or group with respect to such Alternative Transaction Proposal. 

  

 (d) _Changes of Recommendation_. Solely in response to the receipt of an unsolicited, bona fide written Alternative Transaction Proposal which is determined to be a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, may 

   ##### 

  

  

make a Change of Recommendation, if all of the following conditions in clauses
(1) through (5) are met:

   

 (1) the Superior Proposal has been made and has not been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal; 

  

 (2) the stockholder vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting or Parent Stockholders Meeting, as the case may be, has not occurred; 

  

 (3) the Company or Parent, as the case may be, has (A) provided to the other party hereto three business days prior written notice which shall state expressly (i) that it has received a Superior Proposal, (ii) the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person or group of Persons making the Superior Proposal, and (iii) that it intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and the manner in which it intends to do so, and (B) during the aforementioned period, if requested by the other party hereto, engaged in good faith negotiations to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the Alternative Transaction Proposal which was determined to be a Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal; 

  

 (4) the Board of Directors of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the failure of the Board of Directors to effect a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; and 

  

 (5) the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall have complied in all material respects with Section 5.2(c) and shall not have breached in any material respect any of the other provisions set forth in this Section 5.2. 

  

 (e) _Tender Offer Rules_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or Parent or their respective Boards of Directors from taking and disclosing to their stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided that neither party shall effect, or disclose pursuant to such rules or otherwise a position which constitutes, a Change of Recommendation unless specifically permitted pursuant to the terms of Section 5.2(d). 

  

 5.3 _Preparation of SEC Documents; Stockholders  Meetings_. 

  

 (a) _Registration Statement and Prospectus_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Agreement Date, Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included. Each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Parent will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to Parent Stockholders, and the Company will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to Company Stockholders, in each case as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under 

   ##### 

  

  

the Securities Act. Parent shall also take any action (other than qualifying
to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or
filing a general consent to service of process) required to be taken under
any applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance and
reservation of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger and the
conversion of Company Options into Parent Options, and the Company shall
furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of Company
Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
action. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by Parent without
the Companys prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) and without providing the Company the reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent will advise the Company,
promptly after it receives oral or written notice thereof, of the time when
the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of
the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or written
request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests
by the SEC for additional information and will promptly provide the
Company with copies of any written communication from the SEC or any state
securities commission. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information (including any Change of Recommendation) relating to Parent or
the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Registration Statement or
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by law, disseminated to the stockholders of Parent and the Company.

   

 (b) _Stockholders  Meetings_. Each of the Company and Parent shall, as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, take all action necessary in accordance with Applicable Law and the Company Charter Documents, in the case of the Company, and the Parent Charter Documents, in the case of Parent, to duly give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting, in the case of the Company, and the Parent Stockholders Meeting, in the case of Parent. Subject to Section 5.2(d), each of the Company and Parent will use reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of, in the case of the Company, the adoption of this Agreement, and in the case of Parent, the approval of the Parent Stock Issuance and Parent Charter Amendment, and will take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its stockholders required by the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market or Applicable Law to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company or Parent may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting or Parent Stockholders Meeting, as the case may be, to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to its stockholders in advance of a vote on, in the case of the Company, the adoption of this Agreement, and in the case of Parent, the approval of the Parent Stock Issuance and Parent Charter Amendment, or, if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting or Parent Stockholders Meeting, as the case may be, is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company Common   ##### 

  

  

  

Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of such meeting. Each of the Company and Parent shall ensure that the Company
Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting, respectively, is
called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited
in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting or Parent Stockholders
Meeting, as the case may be, are solicited in compliance with Applicable Law,
the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market and, in the case of the Company, the
Company Charter Documents, and, in the case of Parent, the Parent Charter
Documents. Without the prior written consent of Parent, adoption of this
Agreement is the only matter (other than procedural matters) which the
Company shall propose to be acted on by the Company Stockholders at the
Company Stockholders Meeting. Without the prior written consent of the
Company, approval of the Parent Stock Issuance, the Parent Charter Amendment
and any proposals set forth in Schedule 5.3(b) of the Parent Disclosure
Letter are the only matters (other than procedural matters) which Parent
shall propose to be acted on by Parent Stockholders at the
Parent Stockholders Meeting. Notwithstanding any Change of Recommendation by
the Board of Directors of the Company or Parent, (i) adoption of this
Agreement shall be submitted to the Company Stockholders at the Company
Stockholders Meeting and (ii) approval of the Parent Stock Issuance and
Parent Charter Amendment shall be submitted to the Parent Stockholders at the
Parent Stockholders Meeting, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
relieve the Company or Parent of such obligations.

   

 (c) _Time of Meetings_. Each of the Company and Parent will use reasonable best efforts to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and Parent Stockholders Meeting, respectively, on the same date as the other party and as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (d) _Board Recommendations_. Except to the extent expressly permitted by Section 5.2(d): (i) the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Parent shall recommend that its stockholders vote in favor of, in the case of the Company, the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting, and, in the case of Parent, the approval of the Parent Stock Issuance and Parent Charter Amendment at the Parent Stockholders Meeting, (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include a statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of (A) the Company has recommended that the Company Stockholders vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting and (B) Parent has recommended that Parent Stockholders vote in favor of approval of the Parent Stock Issuance and Parent Charter Amendment at the Parent Stockholders Meeting and (iii) neither the Board of Directors of the Company or Parent nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to the other party, the recommendation of its respective Board of Directors that the respective stockholders of the Company or Parent vote in favor of, in the case of the Company, the adoption of this Agreement, and, in the case of Parent, the approval of the Parent Stock Issuance and Parent Charter Amendment. 

  

 5.4 _Accountant s Letters_. Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to the other party two letters from their respective independent accountants, one dated approximately as of the date the Registration Statement is declared effective and one dated approximately as of the Closing Date, each addressed to the other party, 

   ##### 

  

  

in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the other party and customary
in scope and substance for comfort letters delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the
Registration Statement.

   

 5.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. 

  

 (a) _Access to Information_. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and Applicable Law, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives of such other party, reasonable access at all reasonable times on reasonable notice during the period prior to the Effective Time to all their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records (provided, that such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of such party) and, during such period and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and Applicable Law, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other party (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws and (b) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request. No review pursuant to this Section 5.5 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein, the covenants or agreements of the parties hereto or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement. 

  

 (b) _Confidentiality_. Each of the Company and Parent will hold and keep confidential, and will cause its respective officers and employees and will direct its accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives and Affiliates to hold and keep confidential, any nonpublic information in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, which Confidentiality Agreement will remain in full force and effect. 

  

 5.6 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. 

  

 (a) _Governmental and Third Party Approvals_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (1) the obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Authority, including all filings required under the HSR Act, with the Federal Trade Commission or the United States Department of Justice and any necessary antitrust, competition or similar laws of any foreign jurisdiction, (2) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (3) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including promptly seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed, and (4) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments 

   ##### 

  

  

necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry
out the purposes of, this Agreement. Subject to Applicable Law relating to
the exchange of information, the Company and Parent shall have the right to
review in advance, and to the extent reasonably practicable each will consult
the other on, all the information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries
or Parent and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental
Authority or third party in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

   

 (b) _Notification_. Each of the Company and Parent shall keep the other reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required approvals or consents of any Governmental Authority (whether domestic, foreign or supranational). In that regard, each party shall without limitation use its reasonable best efforts to: (1) promptly notify the other of, and if in writing, furnish the other with copies of (or, in the case of material oral communications, advise the other orally of) any communications from or with any Governmental Authority (whether domestic, foreign or supranational) with respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (2) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed written (or any material proposed oral) communication with any such Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (3) to the extent practical, not participate in any meeting with any such Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other in advance and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority gives the other the opportunity to attend and participate thereat, and (4) furnish the other with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the Company or Parent, as applicable, may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions of information to any such Governmental Authority. Each of the Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 5.6 as "outside counsel only". Such material and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (the Company or Parent, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. 

  

 (c) _State Takeover Statutes_. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (i) take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms required by, or provided for, in this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (d) _Divestitures_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or divest, or take any other action with respect to, any of its assets or businesses or 

    ##### 

 

    

enter into any consent decree or other agreement that (1) would reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or the Company
after the Effective Time or (2) is not conditional on consummation of the
Merger.

   

 5.7 _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) _Indemnification and Advancement_. From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to: (1) indemnify and hold harmless each person who served as a director or officer of Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by Applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim (as defined below) and any judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement) resulting therefrom; and (2) promptly pay on behalf of or, within 30 days after any request for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by Applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, and if required by Delaware Law subject to the receipt of an unsecured undertaking to repay such amounts if it is ultimately determined that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification, any Expenses (as defined below) incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating in any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement. The indemnification and advancement obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and any Claim relating thereto) and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer of Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and shall inure to the benefit of such persons heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. As used in this Section 5.7, (1) the term "CLAIM" means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, or any inquiry or investigation that any Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any such action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism, as a result of or in connection with such Indemnified Partys service as a director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of Parent, the Company or any of, their Subsidiaries, as the case may be, or any employee benefit plan maintained by any of the foregoing at or prior to the Effective Time; and (2) the term "EXPENSES" means documented and reasonable attorneys fees and all other documented and reasonable costs, expenses and obligations (including, without limitation, experts fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized pursuant to this

No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms. 

  

 7.3 _Payments_. 

  

 (a) _Payment by the Company_. In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(1), Section 7.1(b)(4) or by Parent pursuant to any of Section 7.1(b)(4), Section 7.1(d) (but, in the case of Section 7.1(d), only if such termination is 

   ##### 

  

  

due to an intentional breach of any representation, warranty or covenant by
the Company) or Section 7.1(f), the Company shall promptly, but in no event
later than ten business days after the date of such termination (subject to
the further provisions of this Section 7.3(a)), pay Parent the Termination
Fee; provided, that in the case of a termination pursuant to Section
7.1(b)(1), Section 7.1(b)(4) or Section 7.1(d) (but, in the case of Section
7.1(d), only if such termination is due to an intentional breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant by the Company), the Termination Fee
shall be payable only if following the Agreement Date and prior to such
termination, any Person shall have made to the Company or its stockholders,
or publicly announced, any Alternative Transaction Proposal with respect to
the Company and within 12 months following termination of this Agreement, any
Alternative Transaction with respect to the Company is consummated or the
Company enters into an agreement providing for an Alternative Transaction,
such fee payment to be made concurrently with the consummation of such

 (c) _Interest and Costs; Other Remedies_. All payments under this Section 7.3 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the party to receive payment. Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the other party hereto would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3 and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party hereto makes a claim that results in a judgment against the party failing to pay for the amounts set forth in this Section 7.3, the party so failing to pay shall pay to the other party its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 7.3 at the rate of interest per annum publicly announced by Bank of America as its prime rate, as in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. Payment of the fees described in this Section 7.3 shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of breach of this Agreement, to the extent permitted by Section 7.2. 

   ##### 

  

  

 7.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time before or after the Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that after the occurrence of either the Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval there may not be, without further approval of the stockholders of the Company and Parent, as the case may be, any amendment of this Agreement which by Applicable Law expressly requires the further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto and duly approved by the parties respective Boards of Directors or a duly designated committee thereof. 

  

 7.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, a party may, subject to Applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance by the other party hereto with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement.

Any extension or waiver given in compliance with this Section 7.5 or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.
