        December 31, 2003 (the "Year-End Balance Sheet") and audited

        audited consolidated balance sheet (including footnotes) of the
        Business as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Date Balance
        Sheet") and audited consolidated statements of income and cash
        flows (including footnotes) for the period beginning on January
        1, 2004 and ending on the Closing Date (the Year-End Balance
        Sheet, the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the consolidated

        Statements"), (C) a statement, calculated in accordance with the

                                     -9-







        Year-End Balance Sheet, setting forth in reasonable detail
        Seller's calculation of Year-End Net Working Capital
        ("Preliminary Year-End Net Working Capital") and (D) a statement,
        calculated in accordance with the Closing Date Balance Sheet,
        setting forth in reasonable detail Seller's calculation of Final
        Net Working Capital (the "Preliminary Closing Net Working
        Capital"; and the statements setting forth the Preliminary Year-
        End Net Working Capital and the Preliminary Closing Net Working
        Capital are referred to herein as the "Preliminary Statements");
        PROVIDED, that if Seller fails to prepare and deliver, or cause
        to be prepared and delivered (other than as a result of
        Purchaser's failure to comply with SECTION 2.3(b)(ii)), the
        Audited Financial Statements and the Preliminary Statements on or
        prior to the 90th calendar day following the Closing Date, Seller
        will pay to Purchaser, as liquidated damages, an amount equal to
        $250,000 for each full week thereafter until the Audited
        Financial Statements and the Preliminary Statements are prepared
        and delivered.  The Audited Financial Statements will be prepared
        in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
        principles ("GAAP"), consistently applied, and will be
        accompanied by an unqualified report of Seller's independent
        accountants.  The Preliminary Statements (x) will be calculated
        (1) after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by
        SECTION 6.2, as of December 31, 2003 or the Closing Date, as the
        case may be, (2) as if the Business financial position, in
        whichever entity or entities then conducted, was being presented
        as a separate and independent entity, and (3) in accordance with
        GAAP, consistently applied, and (y) will be accompanied by (I) a
        report of Seller's independent accountants stating that the
        Preliminary Statements were prepared in accordance with the
        requirements of this SECTION 2.3(b) and (II) documentation that
        provides reasonable support for each of the amounts included in
        the items described on such Preliminary Statements.  The
        Preliminary Statements, as finally modified pursuant to clauses
        (c) through (e) of this SECTION 2.3 to become the final
        statements of Year-End Net Working Capital and Closing Net
        Working Capital, are referred to herein as the "Final
        Statements."  All disputes with respect to the Preliminary
        Statements and the Audited Financial Statements will be resolved
        in accordance with clauses (c) through (e) of this SECTION 2.3.

                  (ii)  From the Closing to the finalization of the Final
        Statements, Purchaser will assist, in good faith, Seller and its
        independent accountants in the preparation of the Audited
        Financial Statements and the Preliminary Statements.  During such
        period, Purchaser will provide Seller and Seller's independent
        accountants access at all reasonable times to the personnel and
        Business Records of the Business for such purpose.

                  (iii)  In connection with the preparation of the
        Audited Financial Statements and the Preliminary Statements,
        Seller will conduct a physical inventory or inventories of the

                                    -10-







        Inventory of the Business.  Seller will notify Purchaser of the
        taking of such inventory at least ten calendar days prior to the
        taking of each such inventory and afford Purchaser and its
        independent accountants the right to observe the taking of each
        such physical inventory.  Seller will adjust, in consultation
        with Purchaser and its accountants, the results of such physical
        inventory to reflect transactions (including transactions such as
        sales of goods and services, purchases of raw materials and the
        conversion of inventory into accounts receivable) from the date
        of such inventory to December 31, 2003, or the Closing Date, as
        the case may be.  Such physical inventories will include the
        valuation determinations (calculated, to the extent applicable,
        in accordance with GAAP) in respect of the Inventory covered
        thereby and such inventories (and the related valuations) will be
        used for the purpose of preparing the Audited Financial
        Statements, the Preliminary Statements and the Final Statements.


                  (iv)  "Net Working Capital", as used herein, means

                       (x)  the sum of the current assets (1) of the
             Acquired Companies, excluding any cash, cash equivalents,
             marketable securities and similar investments of the
             Acquired Companies, and (2) included in the Acquired Assets,

                       minus

                       (y)  the sum of the current liabilities (1) of the
             Acquired Companies and (2) included in the Assumed
             Liabilities.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, Net Working Capital shall not
        include deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities.  Solely
        for purposes of calculating the adjustment pursuant to SECTION
        2.4, each of (A) the cash, cash equivalents, marketable
        securities and similar investments, if any, of the Acquired
        Companies as of the Closing Date and (B) the Excluded Receivables
        will be calculated as a stand-alone item (and not as part of Net
        Working Capital) on the preliminary and final statement of
        Closing Net Working Capital in accordance with the provisions set
        forth in this SECTION 2.3 (including the dispute and dispute
        resolution provisions in clauses (c) through (e)).

             (c)  PURCHASER'S REVIEW OF PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS.

                  (i)  Purchaser will have 45 calendar days following
        Seller's delivery of the Preliminary Statements to Purchaser to
        review and respond to the Preliminary Statements, during which
        period Seller will grant Purchaser and Purchaser's independent
        accountants reasonable access to the work papers prepared by
        Seller's independent accountants (subject to compliance with
        Seller's independent accountants' customary procedures for

                                    -11-







        release) with respect to the Audited Financial Statements and the
        Preliminary Statements.

                  (ii)  Unless Purchaser has delivered to Seller a
        written letter of its disagreement with the Preliminary
        Statements (the "Purchaser's Letter") on or prior to 5:00 p.m.
        (Central Time) on the 45th calendar day following Seller's
        delivery of the Preliminary Statements to Purchaser, the
        Preliminary Statements will become the Final Statements.  If
        Purchaser's Letter is delivered in a timely manner, then (A) any
        amount set forth in the Preliminary Statements as to which
        Purchaser has not objected and proposed an adjustment in
        accordance with SECTION 2.3(c)(iii) below in Purchaser's Letter
        will be deemed to be accepted and will become part of the Final
        Statements, and (B) the Preliminary Statements will become the
        Final Statements on the earlier of (1) the date that Seller and
        Purchaser resolve in writing all remaining disputed matters
        properly specified in Purchaser's Letter or (2) the date that the
        Arbitrator delivers to Seller and Purchaser a copy of the Final
        Statements and the Purchase Price Adjustment pursuant to SECTION
        2.3(e)(vi).

                  (iii)  Purchaser's Letter will (A) set forth in
        reasonable detail any proposed adjustment to the Preliminary
        Statements and the basis for such adjustment (including a
        specific dollar amount and accompanied by a reasonably detailed
        explanation) and (B) only include disagreements based on
        mathematical errors or based on the Audited Financial Statements
        not being calculated in accordance with GAAP or the Preliminary
        Statements not being calculated in accordance with SECTION
        2.3(b).

             (d)  MEETING TO RESOLVE PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS.  As soon as
   reasonably practicable, but in no event no later than 25 calendar
   days, after Purchaser's delivery of Purchaser's Letter, Purchaser and
   Seller will meet and endeavor to resolve the unaccepted adjustments
   described in Purchaser's Letter.  If Purchaser and Seller reach
   agreement in writing on such adjustments, the Final Statements will be
   the Preliminary Statements modified to reflect the adjustments
   accepted pursuant to SECTION 2.3(c)(ii)(A) and those otherwise agreed
   to in writing by the parties pursuant to this SECTION 2.3(d).

             (e)  RESOLUTION BY ARBITRATION.

                  (i)  If Purchaser and Seller do not resolve to their
        mutual satisfaction all disputed adjustments in Purchaser's
        Letter within 25 calendar days following the meeting provided for
        in SECTION 2.3(d), any remaining disputed adjustments that were
        properly included in Purchaser's Letter will be settled by the
        Chicago, Illinois offices of Deloitte & Touche LLP (or, if such
        firm will decline to act or is, at the time of submission
        thereto, a principal independent auditor of Purchaser or Seller,

                                    -12-







        to another independent accounting firm of national reputation
        acceptable to Purchaser and Seller) (either Deloitte & Touche LLP
        or such other accounting firm being the "Arbitrator") in
        accordance with the following provisions of this SECTION 2.3(e).

                  (ii)  On or prior to the 45th calendar day following
        Purchaser's delivery of a Purchaser's Letter to Seller pursuant
        to SECTION 2.3(c)(ii), Purchaser and Seller will furnish the
        Arbitrator with a copy of the Agreement, the Year-End Balance
        Sheet, the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Statements
        and Purchaser's Letter.  Purchaser and Seller will also give the
        Arbitrator access to the Business Records of the Business, as
        well as any accounting work papers or other schedules relating to
        the preparation of the Year-End Balance Sheet, the Closing Date
        Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Statements and Purchaser's
        Letter.

                  (iii)  Within 25 calendar days of submitting the
        disputed adjustments to the Arbitrator pursuant to SECTION
        2.3(e)(ii) that were included in Purchaser's Letter in accordance
        with SECTION 2.3(c)(ii), Purchaser and Seller will provide to the
        Arbitrator and to each other a copy of a written submission
        setting forth their respective positions with respect to each
        remaining disputed adjustment described in Purchaser's Letter.
        Within 25 calendar days thereafter, Purchaser and Seller may
        provide to the Arbitrator and to each other a written rebuttal,
        which will be limited to addressing the points raised in the
        opposing party's initial written submission.  No additional
        written submission will be made to the Arbitrator unless
        specifically requested by the Arbitrator.

                  (iv)  After receiving the written submissions, rebuttal
        responses, if any, and any other written information pursuant to
        SECTION 2.3(e)(iii), the Arbitrator will promptly schedule a date
        to interview persons designated by each party to present that
        party's position.  The interviews will be held on at least seven
        calendar days' notice to each party, and each party, its counsel
        and other advisors may be present and participate in any
        questioning at such interviews.  The interviewing process will
        last no more than two calendar days in the aggregate, unless
        otherwise requested by the Arbitrator.

                  (v)  The Arbitrator's engagement will be limited to (A)
        reviewing the Year-End Balance Sheet, the Closing Date Balance
        Sheet, the Preliminary Statements and the amounts properly placed
        in dispute by Purchaser's Letter pursuant to SECTION 2.3(c); (B)
        reviewing the parties' written submissions provided pursuant to
        SECTION 2.3(e)(iii); (C) determining (1) whether Seller's
        proposed amount for an item in the Preliminary Statements or
        Purchaser's proposed adjustment thereto in Purchaser's Letter is
        calculated more nearly in accordance with SECTION 2.3(b), (2)
        whether there were mathematical errors in the Year-End Balance

                                    -13-







        Sheet, the Closing Date Balance Sheet or the Preliminary
        Statements and (3) whether the Year-End Balance Sheet and the
        Closing Date Balance Sheet were prepared in accordance with GAAP
        on a consistent basis as described in SECTION 2.3(b); (D)
        preparing the Final Statements, which will include those amounts
        in the Preliminary Statements accepted by Purchaser pursuant to
        SECTION 2.3(c)(ii)(A), those adjustment otherwise agreed to in
        writing by the parties pursuant to SECTION 2.3(d), and those
        amounts determined by the Arbitrator to be calculated more nearly
        in accordance with SECTION 2.3(b); and (E) calculating the
        Purchase Price Adjustment.  The fees and expenses of the
        Arbitrator will be borne by Seller and Purchaser in inverse
        proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the
        Arbitrator, which proportionate allocations will also be
        determined by the Arbitrator at the time the determination of the
        Arbitrator is rendered on the Final Statements and the Purchase
        Price Adjustment.

                  (vi)  The Arbitrator will complete its preparation of
        the Final Statements and the Purchase Price Adjustment within 25
        calendar days from the date of the final interview conducted
        pursuant to SECTION 2.3(e)(iv), and will deliver a copy of the
        Final Statements and the Purchase Price Adjustment to Seller and
        Purchaser and, together with a report setting forth each disputed
        adjustment, the Arbitrator's determination with respect thereto,
        and a statement of the Arbitrator's reasons for such
        determination.  The Arbitrator's determination will be conclusive
        and binding upon the parties and may be entered and enforced in
        any court of competent jurisdiction.

             (f)  PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT.  If the Closing
   Net Working Capital is (A) less than the Year-End Net Working Capital,
   Seller will pay Purchaser an amount equal to the Negative Purchase
   Price Adjustment, or (B) greater than the Year-End Net Working
   Capital, Purchaser will pay Seller an amount equal to the Positive
   Purchase Price Adjustment.  The Purchase Price Adjustment will be paid
   within ten Business Days following the date on which the Preliminary
   Statements become the Final Statements (as determined in accordance
   with SECTION 2.3(c)(ii)), together with interest thereon at a rate
   equal to the average daily rate of interest publicly announced by The
   Northern Trust Company in Chicago, Illinois from time to time as its
   prime rate (the "Prime Rate") calculated on the basis of the actual
   number of days elapsed over 365, from the Closing Date to the date of
   payment.  The Purchase Price Adjustment will be paid in immediately
   available funds by wire transfer pursuant to instructions provided in
   writing by the recipient of the funds.  If Seller or Purchaser, as
   applicable, fails to pay all or any portion of the Negative Purchase
   Price Adjustment or Positive Purchase Price Adjustment, respectively
   (together, in each case, with interest thereon) to Purchaser or
   Seller, as applicable, on or before the 10th Business Day following
   the date on which the Preliminary Statements become the Final
   Statements, interest at a rate equal to the Prime Rate plus 10.0% will

                                    -14-







   accrue and be paid with respect to such due but unpaid amount from
   such 10th Business Day until the date such unpaid amount is paid in
   full to Purchaser or Seller, as applicable.

             (g)  NO PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT.  Notwithstanding the
   foregoing provisions of this SECTION 2.3, no Purchase Price Adjustment
   will be made pursuant to this SECTION 2.3 unless the Purchase Price
   Adjustment exceeds the lesser of (x) 5% of the Year-End Net Working
   Capital or (y) $10,000,000 (such lesser amount, the "Collar Amount"),
   and if the Purchase Price Adjustment exceeds the Collar Amount, then
   the amount of the Purchase Price Adjustment in excess of the Collar
   Amount will be made.

        SECTION 2.4    ESTIMATED OTHER ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT.

             (a)  At least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
   Seller will prepare and deliver to Purchaser a written estimate of the
   amount  (the "Estimated Other Adjustment Amount") equal to (i) the
   amount of Excluded Receivables net of reserves (determined, on an
   estimated basis, in accordance with GAAP) as of the Closing Date,
   minus (ii) the amount of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities
   and similar investments, if any, of the Acquired Companies as of the
   Closing Date (and which are therefore acquired by Purchaser).

             (b)  If the Final Other Adjustment Amount is (A) less than
   the Estimated Other Adjustment Amount, Purchaser will pay Seller the
   amount by which the Final Other Adjustment Amount is less than the
   Estimated Other Adjustment Amount, or (B) greater than the Estimated
   Other Adjustment Amount, Seller will pay Purchaser the amount by which
   the Final Other Adjustment Amount is greater than the Estimated Other
   Adjustment Amount.  Any such payment will be paid with ten Business
   Days following the date on which the Preliminary Statements become the
   Final Statements (as determined in accordance with SECTION
   2.3(c)(ii)), together with interest thereon at a rate equal to the
   Prime Rate calculated on the basis of the actual number of days
   elapsed over 365, from the Closing Date to the date of payment.  If
   Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, fails to pay all or any portion of
   the Final Other Adjustment Amount, (together, in each case, with
   interest thereon) to Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, on or before
   the 10th Business Day following the date on which the Preliminary
   Statements become the Final Statements, interest at a rate equal to
   the Prime Rate plus 10.0% will accrue and be paid with respect to such
   due but unpaid amount from such 10th Business Day until the date such
   unpaid amount is paid in full to Purchaser or Seller, as applicable.
   Any payment pursuant to this SECTION 2.4 will be paid in immediately
   available funds by wire transfer pursuant to instructions provided in
   writing by the recipient of the funds.

             (c)  For purposes of this Agreement:

                  (i)  "Excluded Receivables" means all accounts and
        notes receivable, as of the Closing Date, related to the

                                    -15-







        Business, other than accounts and notes receivable of the
        International Asset Sellers; and

                  (ii)  "Final Other Adjustment Amount" means an amount
        equal to (A) the amount of Excluded Receivables net of reserves
        (determined in accordance with GAAP) reflected on the Final
        Statement of Closing Net Working Capital, minus (B) the amount of
        cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and similar
        investments, if any, of the Acquired Companies reflected on the
        Final Statement of Closing Net Working Capital (and which are
        therefore acquired by Purchaser).

             SECTION 2.5  ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE; SECTION 338
   ELECTIONS AND FORMS.

             (a)  The Closing Payment (without taking into account the
   Estimated Other Adjustment Amount) will be allocated among the
   Purchased Assets, the assets of Anchor Hocking Inc. and its Subsidiary
   Anchor Hocking Consumer Glass Corporation (together, the "Anchor
   Entities") and the stock of the Acquired Companies other than the
   Anchor Entities, as set forth on Exhibit C.

             (b)  As soon as practicable after the Purchase Price
   Adjustment, Purchaser will provide a schedule (together with
   EXHIBIT C, the "Proposed Allocation Schedule") allocating the portion
   of Purchase Price Adjustment that is not treated as interest for
   federal income tax purposes (such interest amount to be agreed upon by
   Seller and Purchaser) among the Purchased Assets, the assets of the
   Anchor Entities and the stock of the Acquired Companies.  If Seller
   does not deliver a written notice to Purchaser within 30 days of
   receipt of the Proposed Allocation Schedule specifying in reasonable
   detail the nature of any objection it may have to the Proposed
   Allocation Schedule (an "Objection Notice"), the Proposed Allocation
   Schedule shall be the final allocation of the Purchase Price and other
   relevant items among the Purchased Shares of each Acquired Company and
   the Purchased Assets.  If Seller does deliver an Objection Notice,
   Seller and Purchaser shall attempt to resolve any differences
   identified in the Objection Notice within the succeeding 20 days and,
   if they are able to resolve all such differences, the allocation
   agreed to shall be the final allocation of the Purchase Price and
   other relevant items among the Purchased Shares of each Acquired
   Company and the Purchased Assets.  If they are unable to resolve all
   such differences, any remaining disagreed items shall be submitted to
   the Arbitrator for resolution within the next 30 days.  The Arbitrator
   shall be instructed to determine whether the position maintained by
   Seller or by Purchaser is the more reasonable position and to select
   one of the two positions.  The allocation determined by the Arbitrator
   shall be the final allocation of the Purchase Price and other relevant
   items among the Purchased Shares of each Acquired Company and the
   Purchased Assets.  The fees and costs of the Arbitrator shall be borne
   equally by Purchaser and Seller.  The Proposed Allocation Schedule
   shall be revised, if necessary, to reflect the final allocation of the

                                    -16-







   Purchase Price and other relevant items agreed to by the parties or
   determined by the Arbitrator (as so revised, the "Final Allocation
   Schedule").  Except as otherwise required by law or pursuant to a
   "determination" under Section 1313(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of
   1986, as amended (the "Code"), Purchaser and Seller agree to act, and
   will cause their Affiliates to act, in accordance with the allocations
   contained in the Final Allocation Schedule for all Tax purposes, and
   neither Purchaser nor Seller will take any position inconsistent
   therewith in any Tax Returns or similar filings (including IRS Forms
   8023 and 8594), any Tax refund claim, any Tax litigation, or otherwise
   with respect to any Tax.

             (c)  With respect to  Purchaser's acquisition of the stock
   of the Anchor Entities, (i) Seller and Purchaser will join in making
   an election under Section 338(h)(l0) of the Code, and the Treasury
   Regulations promulgated thereunder (the "SECTION 338(h)(10)
   Election"), (ii) within 60 days following the Closing Date, Seller and
   Purchaser shall prepare, in accordance with the terms set forth in
   SECTION 2.5(a), the respective IRS Forms 8023 (the "Form 8023") on
   which the Section 338(h)(10) Election shall be made, (iii) within 60
   days following the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser properly
   executed Forms 8023 containing information prepared in accordance with
   the terms set forth in SECTION 2.5(a), which Purchaser shall file with
   the IRS not later than 120 days following the Closing Date, (iv) to
   the extent Purchaser notifies Seller that it desires to make any such
   elections, Seller and Purchaser shall jointly and timely make
   elections under state or local tax law comparable to the Section
   338(h)(10) Election with respect to the Anchor Entities not later than
   120 days following the Closing Date, (v) Seller and Purchaser shall,
   as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, cooperate with
   each other to take all other actions necessary and appropriate
   (including filing such forms, returns, elections, schedules and other
   documents as may be required) otherwise to effect, perfect and
   preserve timely Section 338(h)(10) Election in accordance with
   applicable Treasury regulations (or any comparable provisions of state
   or local tax law) or any successor provisions and (vi) Seller and
   Purchaser shall report the sale and acquisition, respectively, of the
   stock of the Anchor Entities consistent with the Section 338(h)(10)
   Election (and any comparable elections under state or local tax laws)
   and shall take no position to the contrary thereto in any Tax Return,
   or in any proceeding before any taxing authority or otherwise.

             (d)  To the extent permissible or required by law, Seller
   and Purchaser shall cooperate in the preparation and timely filing of
   (i) any corrections, amendments or supplements to the Forms 8023 and
   (ii) any state or local forms or reports that are necessary or
   appropriate for purposes of (A) reflecting the Final Allocation
   Schedule and (B) complying with the requirements for making any state
   or local election that is comparable to the Section 338(h)(10)
   Election.  To the extent necessary for the valid filing of any such
   corrections, amendments, supplements, forms or reports, Seller and
   Purchaser shall cooperate in the timely execution thereof.

                                    -17-

   the assignment or attempted assignment of any Business Contract, or

   Asset, Owned Real Property or Business Contract would constitute a

   provided for in SECTION 3.3(c), Purchaser will not assume or be deemed
   to assume any liabilities or obligations thereunder or in connection
   therewith until properly assigned or transferred.  In any such case,
   commencing on the Closing Date and for a period of 12 months

   efforts to obtain any such consents, and Seller and Purchaser each
   will be liable for one-half of any costs incurred in obtaining such
   consents.

             (b)  To the extent that the consents described in
   SECTION 3.3(a) are not obtained prior to Closing, Seller will use
   commercially reasonable efforts to (i) provide Purchaser with the
   economic benefits of any such Purchased Assets, Owned Real Property or
   Business Contract until its termination date, (ii) cooperate in any
   lawful arrangement designed to provide such benefits to Purchaser and
   (iii) enforce, at the request of and for the account of Purchaser, any
   rights of Seller arising from any such Business Contract against any
   third party, including the right to elect to terminate in accordance
   with the terms thereof upon the advice of Purchaser.  The failure or
   inability to obtain any consent subject to this SECTION 3.3(b) will
   not be a breach of this Agreement so long as Seller has carried out
   its obligations under this SECTION 3.3(b).

             (c)  To the extent that Purchaser is provided the benefits
   of any Purchased Asset, Owned Real Property or Business Contract
   pursuant to SECTION 3.3(b), Purchaser will or will cause the
   Subsidiary Purchasers to perform the obligations of Seller thereunder
   or in connection therewith, at no cost to Seller, but only to the
   extent (i) that such action by Purchaser would not result in any
   default thereunder or in connection therewith and (ii) such
   performance pertains to the benefits provided to Purchaser.  Purchaser
   will indemnify Seller against any and all Damages arising out of any
   default by Purchaser in the performance of such obligations.  The
   indemnification of Seller under this SECTION 3.3 will be governed by
   the indemnification provisions set forth in ARTICLE IX hereto.

                                 ARTICLE IV
                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

             Seller hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as set
   forth below:

             SECTION 4.1    ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING.  Seller and
   each of the Acquired Companies and the Asset Sellers is a corporation,
   limited liability company or other business entity duly organized,
   validly existing and, where applicable, in good standing under the

                                    -21-







   laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and each has all necessary
   power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
   carry on its business as currently being conducted.  Each of Seller,
   the Acquired Companies and the Asset Sellers is duly qualified or
   licensed as a foreign corporation and, to the extent applicable, is in
   good standing in each jurisdiction in which its right, title or
   interest in or to any Purchased Assets or the conduct of the Business
   by it makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to
   be so duly qualified or licensed would not have a Material Adverse
   Effect.  True and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation,
   the bylaws or other similar organizational instruments, as amended to
   date, of Seller, each Acquired Company and each Asset Seller, have
   been made available to Purchaser.

             SECTION 4.2    CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES;
   SUBSIDIARIES.

             (a)  SCHEDULE 4.2(a) sets forth (i) the authorized capital
   stock or other equity interests of each of the Acquired Companies,
   (ii) the number of issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or
   other equity interest of each of the Acquired Companies (the "Acquired
   Shares"), and (iii) the record and beneficial holder of the Acquired
   Shares.  The Acquired Shares have been duly authorized and validly
   issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, are not subject to any
   preemptive or subscription rights and were not issued in violation of
   any preemptive or subscription rights.  There are no existing options,
   warrants, calls, subscriptions or other rights, convertible
   securities, trusts or Contracts of any character (x) obligating any of
   the Acquired Companies to issue, transfer or sell any shares of
   capital stock or other equity interest or securities convertible into
   or exchangeable for such shares or equity interests, (y) requiring any
   of the Acquired Companies to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
   any shares of capital stock or other equity interest or securities
   convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity interests,
   or (z) with respect to the voting of the Acquired Shares.  All
   Acquired Shares are owned by a Seller or a Subsidiary of Seller,
   including a Purchased Company, free and clear of any Encumbrances with
   respect thereto.

             (b)  No Acquired Company owns, directly or indirectly, any
   capital stock or other equity interest in any Person that is not one
   of the Acquired Companies, except for the capital stock of the
   Subsidiaries listed on SCHEDULE 4.2(b) (the "Transferred
   Subsidiaries"), to be transferred prior to the Closing pursuant to
   SECTION 6.2.  The Transferred Subsidiaries are not engaged in any
   material respect in the conduct of the Business by the Acquired
   Companies.

             SECTION 4.3    AUTHORIZATION, VALIDITY AND EXECUTION.
   Seller has all necessary corporate power and authority (a) to execute
   and deliver this Agreement and the other agreements, documents and
   instruments to be executed by Seller or its Subsidiaries in connection

   with the transactions contemplated hereby (such other agreements,
   documents and instruments, the "Seller Documents"), (b) to perform (or
   cause to be performed) its obligations hereunder and thereunder and
   (c) to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
   No other corporate or stockholder action is necessary for the
   authorization, execution, delivery and performance by Seller and its
   Subsidiaries of this Agreement and the Seller Documents.  This
   Agreement has been, and each of the Seller Documents will be on or
   prior to the Closing Date, duly executed and delivered by Seller or
   its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and, assuming the due execution of
   this Agreement by Purchaser, is a legal, valid and binding obligation
   of Seller and its Subsidiaries, enforceable against each in accordance
   with its terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may be
   subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
   moratorium, receivership and similar laws affecting the enforcement of
   creditors' rights generally and to general equitable principles.

             SECTION 4.4    CONSENTS AND APPROVALS; NO VIOLATIONS.

   clauses (c) and (d) Permits, consents, notices and filings the absence
   of which, and violations, breaches, defaults, rights, conflicts or

   will own the Business Inventory free and clear of all Encumbrances,

   arisen in the Ordinary Course of Business and represent bona fide
   claims against debtors for sales made, services performed or other
   charges arising on or before the Closing Date, and all of the goods

   delivered or performed in all material respects in accordance with
   applicable orders, Contracts or customer requirements.

             (a)  Seller will permit Purchaser and its appropriate
   representatives to have reasonable access, prior to the Closing Date,
   to the properties and the books and records of the Business during
   normal working hours and upon reasonable notice to familiarize itself
   with such properties and the business of the Business, and to other
   information and employees and personnel of Seller reasonably requested

   copies of any information that relates to any businesses or operations
   of Seller and its Subsidiaries other than the Business; PROVIDED,
   FURTHER, that nothing contained herein will permit Purchaser to

   prepare financial statements that comply with SEC Regulation S-X) to
   the extent retained by Seller; PROVIDED, that prior to the seventh
   anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller and the Asset Sellers will not
   destroy or dispose of any such books and records without the prior
   written consent of Purchaser.  Seller shall use commercially
   reasonable efforts to cause its independent accountants to permit

                                    -50-







   access to their work papers relating to pre-Closing periods, both
   before and after the Closing Date, subject to the execution of a
   standard consent as customarily required by such independent
   accountants.  Seller shall, as reasonably requested, use commercially
   reasonable efforts to cause its independent accountants to cooperate
   with Purchaser, at Purchaser's sole expense, following the Closing
   Date, including in connection with the preparation by Purchaser of
   historical financial statements for the Business and in connection
   with public offerings or private placements of securities (which
   cooperation shall include delivery of comfort letters, delivery of
   consents for inclusion in registration statements as experts, consent
   to the use of its audit reports in offering documents and other
   matters reasonably requested by Purchaser).  Seller shall use its
   commercially reasonable efforts to cause applicable employees to

   during normal working hours and upon reasonable notice to the extent
   reasonably requested, and to employees and personnel of Purchaser
   reasonably requested by Seller and related to the Business, as Seller
   reasonably deems necessary or advisable, in each case in connection
   with its defense and management of any product liability, workers
   compensation, bankruptcy or other claim for which Seller is liable or
   alleged to be liable; PROVIDED, that Seller will not unreasonably
   disrupt the personnel and operations of the Business.

             SECTION 6.4    CONSENTS AND CONDITIONS; HSR ACT.

             (a)  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof,
   each of the parties hereto will use commercially reasonable efforts to
   take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or
   cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
   applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
   transactions contemplated hereby and to cause the Closing to occur,
   including using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Permits,
   consents, qualifications and orders of Governmental Authorities and
   parties to Business Contracts as are necessary for the consummation of
   the transactions contemplated hereby, to effect all necessary
   registrations and submissions of information requested by Governmental
   Authorities, and to fulfill the conditions to the transactions
   contemplated hereby.  No party will take any actions that would, or
   that could reasonably be expected to, result in any of the conditions
   set forth in ARTICLE VIII not being satisfied.

             (b)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as
   promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Purchaser and Seller
   each will properly prepare and file any other filings required by any

                                    -51-







   Governmental Authority relating to the transactions contemplated
   hereby (including filings, if any, required under the HSR Act or the
   Mexican Competition Law) (collectively, the "Other Filings").
   Purchaser and Seller will each promptly notify the other of the
   receipt of any comments on, or any request for amendments or
   supplements to, any Other Filings by any Governmental Authority or
   official, and Purchaser and Seller will each supply the other with
   copies of all correspondence between Purchaser or Seller, as the case
   may be, and any other appropriate governmental official with respect
   to any Other Filings.  Purchaser and Seller hereby covenant and agree
   to use commercially reasonable efforts to secure termination of any
   waiting periods under the HSR Act and obtain the approval of any
   Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the transactions
   contemplated hereby; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing contained herein
   will require Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to (i) agree to sell,
   divest, dispose of or hold separate any assets or businesses, or
   otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of
   action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its
   businesses, product lines or assets, or (ii) litigate, pursue or
   defend against any administrative or judicial action or proceeding
   (including any temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction)
   challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative
   of any antitrust law.  Purchaser will be responsible for all of the
   filing fees payable under the HSR Act, the Mexican Competition Law and
   any other antitrust law, except to the extent related to the Consent
   Order described in SECTION 4.4(ii).

             SECTION 6.5    CONFIDENTIALITY.

             (a)  Purchaser acknowledges that the information being
   provided to it in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
   is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement dated December
   5, 2003, between Purchaser and Seller (the "Confidentiality
   Agreement"), the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.
   Effective upon the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement will
   terminate with respect to information relating solely to the Business;
   PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Purchaser acknowledges that any and all other
   information provided to it by Seller or its representatives or
   Affiliates concerning Seller will remain subject to the terms and
   conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing Date.

             (b)  For a period of three years after the Closing Date,
   Seller will, subject to clause (c) below, keep confidential prior to
   and after Closing, and will not disclose to any Person, any
   Confidential Information to the extent it relates to the Business.
   For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" means any
   non-public information about the Business, other than information
   which is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a
   result of a disclosure by Seller or any person acting on behalf of
   Seller.  To the extent that any Confidential Information does not
   relate exclusively to the Business, Seller may, without the consent of
   Purchaser, disclose such information to any purchaser or potential

                                    -52-







   purchaser (by any means, including by asset sale, stock sale or
   merger) of all or any portion of Seller's business, provided that (i)
   such purchaser or potential purchaser signs a customary
   confidentiality agreement that covers such information, and (ii)
   Seller uses commercially reasonable efforts to enforce such
   confidentiality agreement with respect to such information.

             (c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of
   confidentiality contained herein, as they relate to the transactions
   contemplated by this Agreement, will not apply to the federal tax
   structure or federal tax treatment of such transactions, and each
   party hereto (and any employee, representative, or agent of any party
   hereto) may disclose to any and all persons, the federal tax structure
   and federal tax treatment of such transactions.  The preceding
   sentence is intended to cause such transactions to be treated as not
   having been offered under conditions of confidentiality for purposes
   of Section 1.6011-4(b)(3) (or any successor provision) of the Treasury
   Regulations promulgated under Section 6011 of the Code, and will be
   construed in a manner consistent with such purpose.  In the event that
   Seller or its Affiliates is requested or required (by deposition,
   interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal
   proceedings, subpoenas, civil investigative demand or similar
   process), in connection with any proceeding, to disclose any
   Confidential Information, Seller will give Purchaser prompt written
   notice of such request or requirement so that Purchaser may seek an
   appropriate protective order or other remedy or waive compliance with
   the provisions of this SECTION 6.5(b), and Seller will reasonably
   cooperate with Purchaser to obtain such protective order upon
   Purchaser's request and at Purchaser's expense.  If, in the absence of
   a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Seller or any
   of its Affiliates is nonetheless compelled to disclose Confidential
   Information to or at the direction of any Governmental Authority or
   else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure, penalty or
   adverse consequences, Seller or any of its Affiliates may disclose
   such specifically requested Confidential Information to or at the
   direction of such Governmental Authority only after first notifying
   Purchaser.

             SECTION 6.6    FURTHER ASSURANCES.  From and after the
   Closing, as and when requested by any party, each party will execute
   and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents
   and instruments and will take, or cause to be taken, at the requesting
   party's expense, all such further or other actions, as such other
   party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to consummate the
   transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  Prior to the Closing,
   Seller will notify Purchaser promptly upon if any of the individuals
   listed on SCHEDULE 4.22(a) receives or becomes aware of notice from
   any of the Persons listed on SCHEDULE 6.6 that it intends to or is
   reasonably likely terminate substantially all or any material portion
   of purchases of Business products.



                                    -53-







             SECTION 6.7    RELEASE OF GUARANTEES.  Purchaser will
   reasonably cooperate with Seller, at Seller's request, to assist
   Seller in seeking  to cause Seller and its Affiliates (other than an
   Acquired Company) to be released and removed, as promptly as
   practicable after the Closing, as guarantors under any Business
   Contract provided that such cooperation shall not require Purchaser to
   incur any material expense.

             SECTION 6.8    PUBLICITY.  Prior to the Closing, neither of
   the parties hereto will issue any press release or make any other
   public statement, in each case relating to or connected with or
   arising out of this Agreement or the matters contained herein, without
   obtaining the prior approval of the other party, except as may be
   required by law or by any listing agreement with or listing rules of a
   national securities exchange or trading market or inter-dealer
   quotation system in which case, the party proposing to issue such
   press release or make such public statement will use commercially
   reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party
   before issuing such press release or making such public statement.
   The requirements of this SECTION 6.8 will be in addition to those
   included in the Confidentiality Agreement.

             SECTION 6.9    BUSINESS RECORDS.  After the Closing,
   Purchaser and the Subsidiary Purchasers will afford Seller and its
   attorneys, accountants, officers and other representatives reasonable
   access, during normal business hours, to the books and records of the
   Business as the same existed prior to Closing (and will permit such
   Persons to examine and copy such books and records to the extent
   reasonably requested by such Person), and will cause the directors,
   officers and employees of the Business to furnish all information
   requested by Seller, in connection with financial reporting and Tax
   matters (including financial and Tax audits and Tax contests), third-
   party litigation and other similar business purposes.  Purchaser and
   the Subsidiary Purchasers will not destroy or dispose of any such
   books and records without the prior written consent of Seller;
   PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Purchaser will be entitled to destroy any of
   such books and records after the seventh anniversary of the Closing
   Date with the prior written consent of Seller; PROVIDED FURTHER,
   HOWEVER, that if Seller does not consent to the destruction of such
   books and records, Purchaser may deliver them to Seller.

             SECTION 6.10   BULK TRANSFER LAWS.  Purchaser hereby waives
   compliance by Seller with the provisions of any so-called "bulk
   transfer law" of any jurisdiction in connection with the sale of the
   Purchased Assets to Purchaser and the Subsidiary Purchasers.

             SECTION 6.11   NON-COMPETE.

             (a)  (i)  For a period of three years from the Closing Date,
   Seller will not, and Seller will cause its Affiliates not to, engage,
   directly or indirectly, as a principal or for its own account, solely
   or jointly with others, or through any form of ownership in another

                                    -54-







   Person, in (A) a Competing Frame Business or (B) a Competing Glass
   Business, and (ii) for a period of one year from the Closing Date,
   Seller will, and Seller will cause its Affiliates to, refrain from re-
   entering the moderate cookware segment, except in each case with
   respect to the transactions contemplated by the Transition Services
   Agreement, the Supply Agreements or as otherwise permitted below.

             (b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
   herein, nothing in this SECTION 6.11 will:

                  (i)  Prohibit or restrict the ownership solely for
        investment purposes of less than five percent of the stock of a
        publicly-held corporation whose stock is traded on a national
        securities exchange or listed with the Nasdaq Stock Market and
        who engages in a Competing Frame Business, a Competing Glass
        Business or the moderate cookware segment.

                  (ii)  Prohibit or restrict any Person that is not an
        Affiliate of Seller on the Closing Date and that becomes a
        controlling Affiliate of Seller following the Closing Date, by
        way of a bonafide third-party acquisition of Seller (by way of
        merger, asset sale or other combination or otherwise not intended
        to be a device for the purpose of avoiding this SECTION 6.11),
        from continuing to engage in a Competing Frame Business, a
        Competing Glass Business or the moderate cookware segment in
        which it is engaged at the time it becomes such a controlling
        Affiliate of Seller;

                  (iii)  Prohibit or restrict Seller or any of its
        Affiliates from acquiring equity interests in, or assets of, a
        Person (such Person, together with any Affiliate (or portion of
        any Affiliate) acquired with such Person, the "Acquired Person"),
        PROVIDED if the revenues of such Acquired Person (or generated
        from such Acquired Person's acquired assets) and any Affiliates
        of Seller from a Competing Frame Business, a Competing Glass
        Business or the moderate cookware segment in North America in the
        last 12 full months prior to such acquisition are greater than
        $25,000,000 in such period, Seller will, and Seller will cause
        such Acquired Person and such Affiliates of Seller to, divest
        itself or themselves of the assets and operations of such
        Acquired Person and such Affiliates of Seller that relate
        primarily to the Competing Frame Business, the Competing Glass
        Business or the moderate cookware segment in North America within
        12 months following the date of such acquisition; or

                  (iv)  Require Seller or its Affiliates to prohibit or
        restrict the resale in North America by any Person (including any
        customer or distributor) not affiliated with Seller of products
        manufactured at manufacturing facilities located outside of North
        America.



                                    -55-







             (c)  As used in this SECTION 6.11:

        manufacture, marketing, distribution or sale in North America of
        photograph frames, photograph albums and products expressly
        marketed for the storage of photographs that have been
        manufactured or sold by the Acquired Companies or Asset Sellers
        within the 12-month period immediately prior to the Closing and
        any similar photographic frame products;

                  (ii)  "Competing Glass Business" means the design or

        period immediately prior to the Closing and any other glass
        products similar in design or function; PROVIDED, that "Competing
        Glass Business" will not include (A) the existing activities
        described in SCHEDULE 6.11(c) hereof or (B) the design,
        manufacture, marketing, distribution and sale of any products
        that contain, use or include glass parts as components of
        products that are not primarily made of glass (E.G., A GLASS LID
        FOR A METAL FRYING PAN).

             (d)  If the final judgment of a court of competent
   jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this SECTION 6.11
   is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court
   making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability will have
   the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or
   provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any
   invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision
   that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the
   intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
   Agreement will be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of
   the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

             (e)  Seller agrees that Purchaser and its Affiliates may
   suffer irreparable harm from a breach of any of the covenants and/or
   agreements contained in this SECTION 6.11.  In the event of an alleged
   breach by Seller or any of its Affiliates of any of the provisions of
   this SECTION 6.11, Purchaser or its Affiliates may, in addition to all
   other rights and remedies existing in their favor, apply to any court
   of competent jurisdiction for specific performance, injunctive or
   other relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the
   provisions of this SECTION 6.11.

             SECTION 6.12   CONSULTATION REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.


             (a)  With respect to any report, application or other
   written submission made by Purchaser to a Governmental Authority
   regarding any environmental matters at any of the Owned Real Property

                                    -56-







   or Leased Real Property, Purchaser shall provide Seller with a copy of
   such report, application or written submission no later than the time
   as it is being submitted to the Governmental Authority, provided that
   such report, application or other written submission is related to a
   circumstance for which Purchaser is or will be seeking
   indemnification.

             (b)  If Seller is obligated to indemnify Purchaser
   Indemnified Parties pursuant to SECTION 9.2(c) for any matter
   involving a Remedial Action ("Indemnified Remedial Action", the
   following procedures shall apply with respect to the conduct of such
   Remedial Action:

                  (i)  Seller shall be responsible for managing all
        Indemnified Remedial Actions and shall have the right to select
        environmental consultants subject to the written approval of
        Purchaser, where such approval will not be unreasonably withheld;
        PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Purchaser shall be entitled to undertaken
        and manage any Indemnified Remedial Actions resulting from
        discovery of a Release or violation of Environmental Law that
        would cause either imminent or substantial harm to health or the
        environment or a reasonably anticipated material adverse effect
        on the business of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries.  Seller shall
        not agree to meet with any Governmental Authority or third party
        claimant regarding the Indemnified Remedial Action except where
        required by Law or with the written consent of Purchaser, where
        such consent will not be unreasonably withheld.  Purchaser shall
        have the right to attend and participate in any meeting with any
        Governmental Authority or third party claimant regarding the
        Indemnified Remedial Action, except for meetings taking place as
        part of an unscheduled site inspection.

                  (ii)  Seller shall provide Purchaser or its designees
        with quarterly status reports regarding the status of each
        Indemnified Remedial Action.  Seller shall provide to Purchaser
        or its designees all documents prepared in connection with each
        Indemnified Remedial Action in draft form 15 days prior to
        finalizing such documents and shall reasonably consider
        Purchaser's or its designees' comments, including method and
        timing of any investigation, the selection of the remedy and any
        additional decisions impacting the Business.  Seller shall
        provide Purchaser with final copies of all documents at the time
        of the submission of such documents to any third party or
        Governmental Authority.

                  (iii)  Seller may choose a Remedial Action that is most
        financially and technologically feasible; provided, that Seller
        may not choose an option that would impose restrictive covenants,
        institutional controls or deed restrictions upon any Real
        Property without the written consent of Purchaser or its
        designees, which consent shall be granted or denied after taking
        into consideration the reasonably anticipated land use of the

                                    -57-







        Real Property, minimization of disruption to operations of the
        Business, any future construction and any potential material
        reduction in value of the affected Real Property.

                  (iv)  Seller and its representatives will exercise
        their commercially reasonable efforts to avoid interference with
        the use of the property, assets and the operation of the Business
        when managing an Indemnified Remedial Action.  Purchaser agrees
        to provide reasonable access to Seller, its employees,
        consultants and contractors to the extent access is necessary to
        perform any work required under the Indemnified Remedial Action;
        PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Seller, its employees, consultants and
        contractors provide Purchaser with a minimum of ten days' written
        notice to such access and the parties agree to enter into a
        commercially reasonable access agreement consistent with the
        terms of this paragraph.  Upon Seller's written request,
        Purchaser agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to make
        available to Seller access to utilities, including water and
        electricity, necessary to implement such Indemnified Remedial
        Action.  If Seller requests access to utilities, Seller agrees to
        use commercially reasonable efforts to have its use of the
        utilities separately metered, it being the intent of the parties
        that each shall pay for that portion of monthly utility charges
        attributable to such party's use.  If, in Purchaser's reasonably
        opinion, utility services cannot be separately metered, Seller
        agrees to reimburse Purchaser for such amount as Purchaser and
        Seller agree represents the portion of charges attributable to
        Seller's use of utility services.

                  (v)  If any permits, authorizations or program
        applications must be executed by or obtained in the name of
        Purchase or any Purchaser Affiliate in order to perform
        Indemnified Remedial Action, Purchaser shall execute or cause to
        be executed any such applications, provided that Seller shall be
        responsible for preparing and assembling such applications and
        delivering such applications to Purchaser in a timely manner.


             SECTION 6.13   INTANGIBLE PROPERTY USE PHASE OUT.

             (a)  "RETAINED IP" means trademarks, service marks, brand
   names, logos or trade, corporate or business names of Seller or of any
   of its Subsidiaries that are not included in the Purchased Assets or
   owned by an Acquired Company but are used by the Business on packaging
   or printed advertising and promotional materials, invoices,
   letterhead, company forms, business cards, product instructions or
   like materials (collectively, the "Packaging") included in the
   Purchased Assets or the assets of an Acquired Company as of the
   Closing Date.




                                    -58-







             (b)  Subject to Section 6.13(e), Purchaser shall remove the
   Retained IP from all buildings, signs and vehicles of the Business
   within six months after the Closing Date.

             (c)  Purchaser shall cease using the Retained IP in its
   electronic databases and web sites within 90 days after the Closing
   Date.


             (d)  The Purchaser, any Subsidiary Purchaser and the
   Acquired Companies may use the Packaging or sell the Business
   Inventories after the Closing Date (without altering or modifying such
   Packaging and Business Inventories), until such Packaging is exhausted
   and in any event no more than 12 months after the Closing Date.
   Seller and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, hereby grant to Purchaser,
   any Subsidiary Purchaser and the Acquired Companies a non-exclusive,
   nontransferable, non-sublicensable (except to Purchaser's Affiliates)
   license to use Retained IP in such countries as Seller or its
   Subsidiaries, as applicable, have rights in such Retained IP, during
   such period as the Packaging is being used up by the Purchaser and its
   Affiliates and during the periods set forth in Sections 6.13(b) and
   (c).  In the event that the Purchaser or its Affiliates manufactures
   or produces products after the Closing Date for use with Packaging,
   Seller may reasonably request, and the Purchaser or its Affiliates
   shall provide, samples of such products to examine and ensure that
   such products are of a quality level not materially different from the
   existing Business Inventories at Closing.  In the event that the
   products used with the Packaging are of materially inferior quality,
   Seller may request that the Purchaser or its Affiliates raise the
   quality of the products being manufactured for use with the Packaging.
   If the Purchaser and its Affiliates have not, within forty-five (45)
   days of such notice by Seller,  provided Seller with evidence that the
   quality of its products used in connection with Packaging are
   substantially similar in level of to the products manufactured prior
   to Closing, the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall cease to use such
   Packaging in connection with such products.

             (e)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
   Purchaser shall not be required at any time to remove the Retained IP
   from schematics, plans, manuals, drawings, machines, machinery and the
   like of the Business in existence as of the Closing Date to the extent
   that such instrumentalities are used in the ordinary internal conduct
   of the Business and are not generally observed by the public or
   intended for use as means to effectuate or enhance sales.

             SECTION 6.14   COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES.  In connection
   with the collection of the Excluded Receivables, Seller agrees, and
   agrees to cause its Subsidiaries and representatives, to act in a
   manner reasonably consistent with the past practice of Seller and its
   Subsidiaries to collect for  Seller's account the Excluded
   Receivables; PROVIDED, that Seller will not initiate legal proceedings
   to collect any Excluded Receivables of a material customer of the

                                    -59-







   Business without the prior written consent of Purchaser (not to be
   unreasonably withheld or delayed).

                                 ARTICLE VII
                              EMPLOYEE MATTERS

             SECTION 7.1    EMPLOYMENT OF BUSINESS EMPLOYEES; SEVERANCE.

             (a)  At least two Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller
   will deliver to Purchaser a true and correct list of all employees of
   Seller or any Subsidiary of Seller (i) whose services are used
   exclusively in the Business as of such date, including all such
   employees absent due to vacation, holiday, sickness, short-term
   disability or other approved leave or absence who are expected to
   return to work before the first anniversary of the date of this
   Agreement and (ii) those other employees whom Purchaser and Seller
   agree will be offered employment by Purchaser (the "Employee List").
   Purchaser or a Subsidiary Purchaser will offer employment, effective
   on the Closing, to, and will cause the Acquired Companies to continue
   employment of, all employees on the Employee List whose employment
   with Seller or its Subsidiaries has not terminated on or prior to the
   Closing.  The employees of the Acquired Companies and the employees
   who accept Purchaser's or a Subsidiary Purchaser's offer of employment
   are collectively referred to herein as "Business Employees".

             (b)  Nothing in this Agreement shall create a contract of
   employment or alter the at-will status of any Business Employee.
   Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Agreement to the
   contrary, Purchaser or a Subsidiary Purchaser shall not be prohibited
   by this SECTION 7.1 from terminating the employment of any Business
   Employee following the Closing Date.

             (c)  If during the 12-month period following the Closing
   Date, Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Purchaser terminates the
   employment of any Business Employee, Purchaser will provide such
   Business Employee severance benefits in accordance with SCHEDULE 7.1
   or as otherwise required pursuant to the terms of any collective
   bargaining agreement applicable to such Business Employee.

             (d)  For a reasonable period following the Closing, Seller
   shall use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to retain the
   individual listed on Schedule 7.1(d) to serve as a consultant to
   Purchaser in connection with the transition, and Purchaser shall
   reimburse Seller for the cash compensation due to the individual for
   such period (on the same basis on which Seller has compensated the
   individual with respect to consulting fees).

             SECTION 7.2    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS GENERALLY.

             (a)  Seller and its Subsidiaries will take such action as is
   necessary such that, as of the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies
   cease participation in each Employee Benefit Plan.  Except as

                                    -60-







   otherwise provided herein, after the Closing Date Seller will retain
   all liabilities for claims under such Employee Benefit Plans, whether
   such claims are made before, on or after the Closing Date.

             (b)  Purchaser will credit the Business Employees for their
   service with Seller, the Acquired Companies, the Asset Sellers and
   their Affiliates (and any predecessors in interest) for purposes of
   eligibility and vesting under Purchaser's plans in which Business
   Employees participate after the Closing Date, and any applicable
   vacation or severance policies or programs, but not to the extent such
   credit would result in a duplication of benefits.  Purchaser will
   permit Business Employees (and their eligible spouses and
   beneficiaries) to participate in Purchaser's plans without being
   subject to any waiting periods or any restrictions or limitations for
   pre-existing conditions, except to the extent any such person has not
   satisfied any corresponding applicable waiting period or limitation
   under the Employee Benefit Plans.  Purchaser's plans will credit each
   Business Employee (and any spouses and dependents) with the amount, if
   any, paid during the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs
   under the Employee Benefit Plans towards deductibles, co-pays and out-
   of-pocket maximums.

             SECTION 7.3    401(k) PLAN.  As soon as practicable
   following the Closing Date, Seller or its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
   will spin-off and transfer the account balances (including loan
   accounts and liabilities) of each Business Employee who on the Closing
   Date is a participant in the Newell Rubbermaid 401(k) Savings Plan to
   a 401(k) plan established or maintained by Purchaser, in a trustee-to-
   trustee transfer in accordance with Section 414(l) of the Code.

             SECTION 7.4    WELFARE PLANS.

             (a)  Seller or its Subsidiaries (other than any Acquired
   Company) will retain all Liabilities for claims incurred by a Business
   Employee (and his or her eligible spouse and dependents) on or prior
   to the Closing Date under the Employee Benefit Plans that are welfare
   benefit plans within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA and all
   short term disability, salary continuation, severance plans or
   arrangements (the "Welfare Plans").  For this purpose claims under any
   medical, dental, vision, or prescription drug plan generally will be
   deemed to be incurred on the date that the service giving rise to such
   claim is performed and not when such claim in made; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
   that with respect to claims relating to hospitalization the claim will
   be deemed to be incurred on the first day of such hospitalization and
   not on the date that such services are performed.  Claims for
   disability under any long or short term disability plan will be
   incurred on the date the Business Employee is first absent from work
   because of the condition giving rise to such disability and not when
   the Business Employee is determined to be eligible for benefits under
   the applicable Welfare Plan.  Seller will provide any continuation
   coverage required under Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or applicable state
   law ("COBRA") to each "qualified beneficiary" as that term is defined

                                    -61-







   in COBRA whose first "qualifying event" (as defined in COBRA) occurs
   on or prior to the Closing Date and each "M&A Qualified Beneficiary",
   as defined under Treasury designation Section 54.4980B-9.

             (b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, as soon as practicable
   following the Closing Date, Seller or its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
   will spin-off and transfer all of the accounts of its Section 125
   flexible spending plan attributable to Business Employees to a new
   Section 125 flexible spending plan established by Purchaser.  Seller
   and its Subsidiaries (other than the Acquired Companies) will have no
   liability with respect to Purchaser's Section 125 flexible spending
   plan after the Closing Date, including liability for any claims
   incurred prior to the Closing Date.

             SECTION 7.5    RETIREE HEALTH.  As of the Closing Date,
   Purchaser will establish for Business Employees a retiree health
   insurance plan that provides benefits comparable to, and on the same
   terms and conditions as, benefits provided under Seller's current
   medical plan immediately prior to the Closing Date with respect to
   each Business Employee who on the Closing Date is a participant in
   such medical plan (I.E., would be entitled to retiree medical coverage
   under such plan had such Business Employee remained employed, and
   terminated employment, with Sellers, Asset Sellers or any Acquired
   Company).  In the event that Seller's current medical plan for
   retirees is amended, modified or changed prospectively or
   retroactively with respect to benefits provided to retirees, Purchaser
   shall only be responsible for offering retiree health insurance
   benefits on the same terms and conditions as existed under Seller's
   current medical plan for retirees immediately prior to the Closing
   Date.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
   Purchaser will not assume any liabilities with respect to any retiree
   health insurance benefits of any current or former employee of Seller
   or its Subsidiaries who is not a Business Employee, and any such
   benefits will continue to be provided under the medical plan for
   retirees.  With respect to Business Employees whose employment is
   subject to a collective bargaining agreement, any retiree health
   benefits will be provided in accordance with the terms of the
   applicable collective bargaining agreement.  Unless otherwise set
   forth in a collective bargaining agreement, the Purchaser shall have
   the right to amend or terminate the plan or arrangement providing
   retiree health benefits to Business Employees at any time.

             SECTION 7.6    NON-SOLICITATION.

             (a)  For two years following the Closing Date, Purchaser and
   its Affiliates will not (i) directly or indirectly solicit or seek to
   induce any employee of Seller or any of its Affiliates to leave his or
   her employment or position with Seller or any of its Affiliates or
   (ii) hire any person who was an Employee of Seller or any of its
   Affiliates within 90 days prior to the date of such hire.



                                    -62-







             (b)  For two years following the Closing Date, Seller and
   its Affiliates will not (i) directly or indirectly solicit or seek to
   induce any Business Employee to leave his or her employment or
   position with Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or (ii) hire any
   person who was a Business Employee or an employee of the Business
   within 90 days prior to the date of such hire.

             (c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set
   forth in this SECTION 7.6 will not prohibit either party or its
   respective Affiliates from:  (i) advertising employment opportunities
   in any general solicitation, including national newspaper, trade
   journal or other publication in a major metropolitan area or any
   third-party Internet website posting, or negotiating with, offering
   employment to or employing any Person contacted through such medium,
   (ii) participating in any third-party hiring fair or similar event
   open to the public or negotiating with, offering employment to or
   employing any Person contacted through such medium or (iii)
   soliciting, negotiating with, offering employment to or employing any
   Person at any time (A) following 90 days after the termination by such
   Person of his or her employment with a party or any of its Affiliates
   or (B) at any time after the termination by a party or any of its
   Affiliates of such Person's employment with such party or any of its
   Affiliates.

   if not so attached, in form reasonably satisfactory to Seller.

                                 ARTICLE IX
                        SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION

             SECTION 9.1    SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS.  The
   representations and warranties made in this Agreement will terminate
   90 calendar days after the later of (a) delivery by Purchaser's
   auditor to Purchaser of its audit of the financial statements of the
   Business, or such Subsidiaries of Purchaser that include the Business,
   for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, or (b) June 30, 2005;
   PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any claims of a breach of any such surviving

                                    -65-







   representation or warranty made in good faith in writing and received
   by Seller prior to such termination date will survive such date to the
   extent of the facts alleged in such claim; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that
   the representations contained in SECTION 4.18 shall survive until the
   fifth anniversary of the Closing Date; and provided further that the
   representations contained in SECTION 4.2 AND 4.16 shall survive the
   Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable statute of
   limitations.  The covenants and agreements contained herein to be
   performed or complied with after the Closing (other than the covenant
   and agreement to indemnify against breaches of certain representations
   and warranties, which will survive only until the expiration of the
   underlying representation and warranty) will survive the execution and
   delivery of this Agreement, the Closing and the consummation of the
   transactions contemplated hereby.

             SECTION 9.2    INDEMNIFICATION BY SELLER OTHER THAN FOR
   TAXES.

             (a)  Subject to the limitations set forth in SECTION 9.4(a)
   through (i), Seller will indemnify Purchaser, its Subsidiaries and
   their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (the
   "Purchaser Indemnified Parties") against, and hold them harmless from,
   any loss, liability, assessment, Tax, fine, penalty, claim, damage,
   expense or cost of mitigation actually suffered or paid (including
   reasonable legal fees and expenses) ("Damages") arising from any
   breach of any representation or warranty of Seller in this Agreement
   (other than with respect to Taxes and other than the representations
   and warranties contained in SECTION 4.18).

             (b)  Subject to the limitations set forth in SECTION 9.4(e)
   through (i), Seller will indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
   against, and hold them harmless from, any Damages arising from:

                  (i)  Any breach of any covenant by Seller set forth in
   this Agreement (other than with respect to Taxes);

                  (ii)  Any Excluded Liability;

                  (iii)  Product liability claims relating to products of
        the Business arising out of occurrences prior to the Closing
        Date;

                  (iv)  Any claims, including workers compensation and
        similar claims, made by or with respect to current or former
        employees of the Acquired Companies who are not Business
        Employees or by Business Employees relating to occurrences prior
        to the Closing Date;

                  (v)   The assets, liabilities and Contracts
        transferred, assumed or terminated pursuant to SECTION 6.2;



                                    -66-







                  (vi)  The failure to comply with any "bulk sales"
        notice requirement in connection with the transactions
        contemplated hereby;

                  (vii) The bankruptcy matters set forth on SCHEDULE
        9.2(b)(vii);

                  (viii) Any casualty or condemnation of any Owned Real
        Property or Leased Real Property occurring after the date hereof
        and prior to the Closing; and

                  (ix)  Any claims (other than Assumed Liabilities and
        claims that are the subject of SECTION 9.2(b)(iii) or (iv))
        arising out of occurrences prior to the Closing Date that are
        covered by insurance of which Seller or any Seller Affiliate,
        including any Acquired Company, is a beneficiary that was in
        effect with respect to the Business prior to the Closing Date.

   For purposes of determining whether claims are covered by insurance as
   provided in SECTION 9.2(b)(ix), the decision as to coverage of the
   insurance carrier (typically, The Traveler's Insurance Company) will
   be conclusive; PROVIDED that (i) Seller will submit to the relevant
   insurance carrier all such claims asserted by Purchaser for which
   there is a reasonable basis for coverage, and (ii) after such efforts
   to establish coverage as Seller elects to make, Seller will afford
   Purchaser an opportunity to contest any denial of coverage directly
   against the insurance carrier.  As and when requested by Purchaser,
   Seller will, at Purchaser's expense, execute and deliver, or cause to
   be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and will
   take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions, as
   Seller may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to permit Purchaser
   to so contest such denials.

             (c)  Subject to the limitations set forth in SECTION 9.4(c)
   and (e) through (m), Seller will indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified
   Parties against, and hold them harmless from, any Environmental
   Liabilities arising from:

                  (i)  any breach of the representations and warranties
        contained in SECTION 4.18; and

                  (ii)  any condition, whether known or unknown, existing
        prior to the Closing Date relating to:

                  (A)  Releases or threatened Releases of Hazardous
        Materials at or from the assets, facilities and properties owned
        and operated by the Business or any predecessor in interest,
        including the Real Property, any Former Property, any Closed
        Property or any Shared Property;

                  (B)  Releases or threatened Releases of Hazardous
        Materials at any disposal or treatment facilities that received

                                    -67-







        Hazardous Materials generated by the Business or any predecessor
        in interest;

                  (C)  Violations of Environmental Laws relating to the
        Business, the Purchased Assets, the Real Property, any Former
        Property, any Closed Property or any Shared Property;

                  (D)  Personal injury (including wrongful death) or
        property damage (real or personal) arising out of exposure to
        Hazardous Materials used, handled, generated, transported or
        disposed by the Business or Hazardous Materials at or emanating
        from the assets, facilities and properties owned and operated by
        the Business or any predecessor in interest, including any Owned
        Real Property and Leased Real Property; or

                  (E)  Environmental Claim; or

                  (F)  The generation, migration, use, treatment,
        storage, recovery, transport, Release, disposal or other handling
        of Hazardous Materials in violation of Environmental Laws in
        connection with either the Business or the Purchased Assets or in
        connection with any Owned Real Property, any Leased Real
        Property, any Former Property, any Closed Property or any Shared
        Property.

             SECTION 9.3    INDEMNIFICATION BY PURCHASER OTHER THAN FOR
   TAXES.

             (a)  Subject to the limitations set forth in SECTION 9.4(a),
   (b), (c), (e), (f), (h) and (i), Purchaser will indemnify Seller, its
   Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees and
   agents (the "Seller Indemnified Parties"), against, and hold them
   harmless from, any Damages arising from any breach of any
   representation or warranty of Purchaser in this Agreement.

             (b)  Subject to the limitations set forth in SECTION 9.4(e),
   (f), (h) and (i), Purchaser will indemnify the Seller Indemnified
   Parties against, and hold them harmless from, any Damages arising
   from:

                  (i)  Any breach of any covenant by Purchaser set forth
        in this Agreement (other than with respect to Taxes);

                  (ii)  Any Assumed Liability;

                  (iii) Any obligation of Seller or any of its Affiliates
        (other than the Acquired Companies) as guarantors under any
        Business Contract; and

                  (iv)  Product liability claims relating to products of
        the Business arising out of occurrences on or after the Closing
        Date;

                                    -68-







                  (v)  All Liabilities for claims incurred by a Business
        Employee (or his or her eligible spouse and dependents)
        consisting of (A) Liabilities described in SECTION 7.3, (B)
        Liabilities described in SECTION 7.4(b) and (C) Liabilities
        described in SECTION 7.5; and

                  (vi)  All Liabilities for claims related to occurrences
        on or after the Closing Date by any Business Employee, including
        workers compensation and similar claims.

             (c)  Subject to the limitations set forth in SECTION 9.4(c),
   (e), (f), (h) and (i), Purchaser will indemnify the Seller Indemnified
   Parties against, and hold them harmless from, any Damages arising from
   all Environmental Liabilities related to the generation, migration,
   treatment, storage, recovery, Release, transport or disposal of
   Hazardous Materials in violation of Environmental Laws (A) in
   connection with either the Business or the Purchased Assets, at any
   time on or after the Closing Date, or (B) in connection with the Owned
   Real Property and the Leased Real Property at any time on or after the
   Closing Date; PROVIDED that Purchaser shall have no obligation under
   this SECTION 9.3(c) to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties
   insofar as Seller is obligated to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified
   Parties for such Liabilities.

             SECTION 9.4    LIMITS ON INDEMNIFICATION.

             (a)  Neither Seller nor Purchaser will be required to
   indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party,
   respectively, pursuant to SECTION 9.2(a) or 9.3(a), respectively, for
   any individual item where the Damages relating thereto for which
   Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, would otherwise be required to
   indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified
   Parties, respectively, hereunder are less than $50,000.

             (b)  Neither Seller nor Purchaser will be required to
   indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party or any Seller Indemnified
   Party, respectively, pursuant to SECTION 9.2(a) or 9.3(a),
   respectively, unless the aggregate amount of Damages for which Seller
   or Purchaser, as applicable, would otherwise be required to indemnify
   the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties,
   respectively, hereunder exceeds $15,000,000, and in such case Seller
   or Purchaser, as applicable, will only be required to indemnify the
   Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties,
   respectively, for Damages in excess of the first $15,000,000 of
   aggregate Damages.

             (c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
   this Agreement, the maximum amount of Damages for which Seller or
   Purchaser will be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified
   Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, respectively, for under SECTION
   9.2(a) and (C) or SECTION 9.3(a) and (c), respectively, will be
   $100,000,000.

                                    -69-







             (d)  Seller will have no liability for a breach of SECTION
   4.19(c) or 4.19(d) for failing to disclose any service or Contract
   that is required thereby to be listed on SCHEDULE 4.19(c) or 4.19(d),
   as applicable, if either (i) Seller currently provides such service in
   the operation of its business to its existing business units, or has a
   Contract with a third-party vendor with respect to the services
   provided to the Business under such Contract and such service of
   Purchaser or provided by the third-party vendor can be adapted without
   material burden to perform such service for the Business or (ii) the
   Business is able to obtain (after using commercially reasonable
   efforts) such products or services on substantially equivalent terms
   and conditions (as to the Business) from a no less qualified third-
   party vendor.

             (e)  In case any event occurs which would otherwise entitle
   either party to assert a claim for indemnification hereunder, no
   Damages will be deemed to have been sustained by such party to the
   extent of (i) any Tax savings actually realized by such party with
   respect thereto in the year in which such event occurs or in any
   earlier year, or (ii) any proceeds received by such party from any
   insurance policies with respect thereto.  In the event a party (x)
   actually realizes a tax benefit as a result of an event that entitles
   such party to indemnification hereunder in a year after such event
   occurs, (y) such tax benefit was not taken into account in the
   calculation of Damages previously payable to such party and (z) such
   party received payment of Damages owed to it as a result of such
   indemnifiable event, such party shall pay to the party that made such
   indemnification payment the amount of such tax benefit actually
   realized in such later year, such payment to occur no later than 30
   calendar days following the filing of the Tax Return reflecting such
   benefit.

             (f)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
   Agreement, Damages shall expressly exclude consequential damages,
   special damages, incidental damages, indirect damages, punitive
   damages, lost profits and similar items, unless arising out of a Third
   Party Claim.

             (g)  The amount of any Damages claimed by Purchaser
   hereunder will be reduced to the extent that Purchaser receives the
   benefit of an adjustment pursuant to SECTION 2.3 hereof in which the
   item that is the subject of the indemnification claim was specifically
   taken into account in the determination of the Final Statement.

             (h)  To the extent that Seller or Purchaser discharges any
   claim for indemnification hereunder, the Indemnifying Party will be
   subrogated to all related rights of the Indemnified Party against
   third parties.

             (i)  Each Indemnified Party will be obligated in connection
   with any claim for indemnification under SECTIONS 9.2 and 9.3 to use
   commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate Damages upon and after

                                    -70-







   becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to give
   rise to such Damages.

             (j)  Seller will have no obligation to indemnify the
   Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to SECTION 9.2(c) insofar as
   the Environmental Liabilities arise from any Purchaser Indemnified
   Party soliciting involvement by a Governmental Authority or any
   Purchaser Indemnified Party conducting, or causing to be conducted,
   any soil, groundwater or other subsurface testing, drilling or
   excavation, that, in each such case, is not required by a Governmental
   Authority or Environmental Law; provided however, that this SECTION
   9.2(j) will not apply to any soil, groundwater or other subsurface
   testing, drilling or excavation conducted (1) to address, prevent or
   mitigate any Release or threatened Release or violation of
   Environmental Law; (2) in response to an Environmental Condition;
   provided, however, that such Environmental Condition was not set forth
   on SCHEDULE 4.18 nor was such Environmental Condition identified as a
   Recognizable Environmental Condition (as that term is defined by ASTM
   1527-00) in the Purchaser's Phase I Environmental Site Assessments
   conducted prior to Closing; (3) in response to a request by a third
   party to conduct due diligence related to a proposed sale or lease of
   any property or asset, any divestiture, any financing, a public
   offering or obtaining any insurance; (4) during the normal course of
   operation of the Business, including construction, expansion,
   operation, maintenance, redevelopment or repair of the assets,
   facilities and properties owned and operated by the Business; (5) to
   implement Best Management Practices, as defined by an Governmental
   Authority or Environmental Law; or (6) or otherwise as required by
   Law.

             (k)  "Environmental Condition" refers to the presence or
   likely presence of (a) a violation of Environmental Law or (b) a
   Release or threatened Release of Hazardous Materials in soil,
   subsurface, surface water or groundwater on, in, under or from the
   assets facilities and properties owned and operated by the Business.

             (l)  Seller will have no obligation to indemnify the
   Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to SECTION 9.2(c) after the
   fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, except that if a claim for such
   indemnification is made in good faith in writing and received by
   Seller prior to the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date such claim
   will survive such anniversary.

             (m)  Seller's obligation to indemnify the Purchaser
   Indemnified Parties pursuant to SECTION 9.2(c) for Remedial Action to
   be conducted after the Closing Date is subject to the condition that
   (in compliance with applicable Law and in consultation with Purchaser
   to the extent provided in SECTION 6.12), Seller shall (i) control the
   planning, selection, design and implementation of all Remedial Action,
   including consulting with Purchaser and using commercially reasonable
   efforts to implement the least expensive remedial alternative
   consistent with Environmental Law and approved by the applicable

                                    -71-







   Governmental Authority, such as institutional controls or other
   mechanisms for eliminating risk pathways, as permitted by applicable
   Law, (ii) control the selection of consultants and contractors, and
   (iii) not be required to conduct, or be responsible for Damages with
   respect to, any Remedial Action that is not necessary to comply with
   applicable legal requirements for an industrial facility.

             SECTION 9.5    PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION.  Any party
   seeking indemnification under this ARTICLE IX (an "Indemnified Party")
   will give each party from whom indemnification is being sought (each,
   an "Indemnifying Party") notice of any matter for which such
   Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification, stating the amount of
   the Damages, if known, and method of computation thereof, and
   containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect
   of which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises.  The
   obligations of an Indemnifying Party under this ARTICLE IX with
   respect to Damages arising from any claims of any third party which
   are subject to the indemnification provided for in this ARTICLE IX
   (collectively, "Third-Party Claims") will be governed by and
   contingent upon the following additional terms and conditions:  if an
   Indemnified Party receives, after the Closing Date, initial notice of
   any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will give the
   Indemnifying Party notice of such Third-Party Claim within such time
   frame as necessary to allow for a timely response and in any event
   within 30 calendar days of the receipt by the Indemnified Party of
   such notice; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to provide such
   timely notice will not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
   obligations under this ARTICLE IX except to the extent the
   Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure.  The Indemnifying
   Party will be entitled to assume and control the defense of such
   Third-Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice if
   it gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party
   within 45 calendar days of the receipt of such notice from the
   Indemnified Party; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if there exists a conflict
   of interest that would make it inappropriate in the reasonable
   judgment of the Indemnified Party (upon and in conformity with advice
   of counsel) for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified
   Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party will be
   entitled to retain one counsel (plus one local counsel, if necessary),
   reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, at the expense of the
   Indemnifying Party, provided that the Indemnified Party and such
   counsel will contest such Third-Party Claims in good faith.  In the
   event the Indemnifying Party exercises the right to undertake any such
   defense against any such Third-Party Claim as provided above, the
   Indemnified Party will cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such
   defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the
   Indemnifying Party's expense, all witnesses, pertinent records,
   materials and information in the Indemnified Party's possession or
   under the Indemnified Party's control relating thereto as is
   reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party.  Similarly, in the
   event the Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the
   defense against any such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party

                                    -72-







   will cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make
   available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Party's
   expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the
   Indemnifying Party's possession or under the Indemnifying Party's
   control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnified
   Party.  The Indemnifying Party will not, without the written consent
   of the Indemnified Party (which will not be unreasonably withheld or
   delayed), settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim or consent to the
   entry of any judgment which does not include as an unconditional term
   thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to Indemnified Party
   of a written release from all liability in respect of such Third-Party
   Claim.  No Third-Party Claim which is being defended in good faith by
   the Indemnifying Party or which is being defended by the Indemnified
   Party as provided above in this SECTION 9.5 will be settled by the
   Indemnified Party without the written consent of the Indemnifying
   Party (which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

             SECTION 9.6    EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.  Other than the remedies
   set forth in SECTION 6.11 and with respect to indemnification for
   Taxes, which are subject to ARTICLE X, the indemnification provided
   for in this ARTICLE IX will constitute the sole remedy of any party to
   the Agreement with respect to breaches by any other party to the
   Agreement of any of the representations, warranties, agreements or
   covenants contained in the Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE X
                                 TAX MATTERS

             SECTION 10.1   TAX INDEMNIFICATION.

             (a)  Seller will be liable for and will pay, and will
   indemnify Purchaser Indemnified Parties against, all Excluded Taxes.

             (b)  Purchaser will be liable for and will pay, and will
   indemnify Seller Indemnified Parties against any and all Taxes imposed
   on or payable with respect to the Acquired Companies or the Business,
   other than Excluded Taxes.

             (c)  Seller and Purchaser shall each be liable for and shall
   pay 50 percent of any and all sales and use Taxes, recording fees,
   stamp Taxes and any other similar transfer Taxes that may be imposed
   upon, payable, collectible or incurred in connection herewith and the
   transactions contemplated hereby, regardless of the Person liable for
   such Taxes under applicable law, except that Purchaser shall be solely
   liable for all such incremental Taxes that are imposed upon, payable,
   collectible or incurred in connection with or as a result of the
   Section 338(h)(10) Election.  Seller and Purchaser will use
   commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the amount of such Taxes.


             (d)  Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, will provide
   reimbursement for any Tax paid by one party, all or a portion of which

                                    -73-







   is the responsibility of the other party pursuant to SECTION 10.1.
   Payment by the Indemnifying Party of any amount due under this SECTION
   10.1 will be made within ten calendar days following written notice by
   the indemnified party that payment of such amount is due (specifying
   in reasonable detail the nature of the Tax paid) and without right of
   offset; PROVIDED, that, if the Indemnified Party is required to make a
   payment to a taxing authority, the Indemnifying Party will not be
   required to make any payment earlier than three calendar days before
   such payment is due.

             SECTION 10.2   PREPARATION AND FILING OF TAX RETURNS.

             (a)  Seller will timely prepare and file or will cause to be
   timely prepared and filed (i) any combined, consolidated or unitary
   Tax Return that includes Seller or any of its Affiliates, and (ii) any
   Tax Return of the Acquired Companies for any taxable period that ends
   on or before the Closing Date.  For any Straddle Period Tax Return of
   the Acquired Companies that is the responsibility of Seller under this
   SECTION 10.2(a), Seller will deliver to Purchaser for its review,
   comment and approval (which approval will not be unreasonably
   withheld, conditioned or delayed) a copy of such proposed Tax Return
   (accompanied by an allocation between the Pre-Closing Period and the
   Post-Closing Period of the Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Return)
   at least 30 calendar days prior to the due date (giving effect to any
   validly obtained extensions) thereof.

             (b)  Purchaser will, except to the extent that such Tax
   Returns are the responsibility of Seller under SECTION 10.2(a), timely
   prepare and file or will cause to be timely prepared and filed all Tax
   Returns with respect to the Acquired Companies.  For any Straddle
   Period Tax Return of the Acquired Companies that is the responsibility
   of Purchaser under this SECTION 10.2(b), Purchaser will deliver to
   Seller for its review, comment and approval (which approval will not
   be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) a copy of such
   proposed Tax Return (accompanied by an allocation between the Pre-
   Closing Period and the Post-Closing Period of the Taxes shown to be
   due on such Tax Return) at least 30 calendar days prior to the due
   date (giving effect to any validly obtained extensions) thereof.

             SECTION 10.3   REFUNDS, CREDITS AND CARRYBACKS.

             (a)  Seller will be entitled to any refunds or credits of or
   against any Excluded Taxes.  Purchaser will, at Seller's reasonable
   request and at Seller's sole expense, cause the relevant entity to
   file for and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any refund
   or credit to which Seller is entitled.  Subject to SECTION 10.3(c),
   Purchaser will be entitled to any refunds or credits of or against any
   Taxes other than refunds or credits of or against Excluded Taxes.
   Seller will, at Purchaser's reasonable request, and at Purchaser's
   sole expense, cause the relevant entity to file for and use
   commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any refund or credit to
   which Purchaser is entitled.

                                    -74-







             (b)  Purchaser will cause the Acquired Companies promptly to
   forward to Seller or to reimburse Seller for any refunds or credits
   due Seller (pursuant to the terms of this ARTICLE X) after receipt
   thereof, and Seller will promptly forward to Purchaser or reimburse
   Purchaser for any refunds or credits due Purchaser (pursuant to the
   terms of this Article X) after receipt thereof.

             (c)  Purchaser agrees that none of the Acquired Companies
   will elect to carry back any item of loss, deduction or credit that
   arises in any taxable period ending after the Closing Date and that
   relates to or affects any Excluded Tax (a "Subsequent Loss") into any
   taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date.  In the case of
   the Purchased Companies, Purchaser will make the election under
   Section 1.1502-21(c)(3)(i) of the Code on its first U.S. consolidated
   federal income tax return filed for the Purchased Companies.

             SECTION 10.4   TAX CONTESTS.

             (a)  If any taxing authority asserts a Tax Claim in respect
   of the Acquired Companies, then the party hereto first receiving
   notice of such Tax Claim promptly will provide written notice thereof
   to the other party hereto; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure of such
   party to give such prompt notice will not relieve the other party of
   any of its obligations under this ARTICLE X, except to the extent that
   such failure precludes the contest of such Tax Claim.  Such notice
   will specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Tax Claim to the
   extent the party giving such notice is aware of such basis and will
   include a copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received
   from the taxing authority.

             (b)  Seller will have the right to control, at its own
   expense, in any audit, examination, contest, litigation or other
   proceeding by or against any taxing authority (a "Tax Proceeding") in
   respect of the Acquired Companies for any taxable period that ends on
   or before the Closing Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) Seller will
   provide Purchaser with a timely and reasonably detailed account of
   each stage of such Tax Proceeding, (ii) Seller will consult with
   Purchaser before taking any significant action in connection with such
   Tax Proceeding, (iii) Seller will consult with Purchaser and offer
   Purchaser an opportunity to comment before submitting any written
   materials prepared or furnished in connection with such Tax
   Proceeding, (iv) Seller will defend such Tax Proceeding diligently and
   in good faith as if it were the only party in interest in connection
   with such Tax Proceeding, (v) Purchaser will be entitled to
   participate, at its own expense, in such Tax Proceeding and receive
   copies of any written materials relating to such Tax Proceeding
   received from the relevant taxing authority, and (vi) Seller will not
   settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without
   obtaining the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent will
   not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.



                                    -75-







             (c)  In the case of a Tax Proceeding for a Straddle Period
   of the Acquired Companies, the Controlling Party will have the right
   to control, at its own expense, such Tax Proceeding; provided,
   however, that (i) the Controlling Party will provide the Non-
   Controlling Party with a timely and reasonably detailed account of
   each stage of such Tax Proceeding, (ii) the Controlling Party will
   consult with the Non-Controlling Party before taking any significant
   action in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (iii) the Controlling
   Party will consult with the Non-Controlling Party and offer the Non-
   Controlling Party an opportunity to comment before submitting any
   written materials prepared or furnished in connection with such Tax
   Proceeding, (iv) the Controlling Party will defend such Tax Proceeding
   diligently and in good faith as if it were the only party in interest
   in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (v) the Non-Controlling Party
   will be entitled to participate in such Tax Proceeding, at its own
   expense, if such Tax Proceeding could have an adverse impact on the
   Non-Controlling Party or any of its Affiliates and (vi) the
   Controlling Party will not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax
   Proceeding without obtaining the prior written consent, which consent
   will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, of the Non-
   Controlling Party.

             (d)  Purchaser will have the right to control, at its own
   expense, any Tax Proceeding involving the Acquired Companies (other
   than a Tax Proceeding described in clauses (b) and (c) of this SECTION
   10.4).

             (e)  The Controlling Party will indemnify and hold the Non-
   Controlling Party, its Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
   directors, employees and agents, harmless from any Taxes (and any
   related costs imposed by a court or other tribunal) arising out of or
   resulting from the Controlling Party's failure to comply with its
   obligations under clauses (b), (c) or (d) of this SECTION 10.4, as the
   case may be.

             SECTION 10.5   COOPERATION.  Each party hereto will, and
   will cause its Affiliates to, provide to the other party hereto such
   cooperation, documentation and information as either of them
   reasonably may request in (a) filing any Tax Return, amended Tax
   Return or claim for refund, (b) determining a liability for Taxes or
   an indemnity obligation under this ARTICLE X or a right to refund of
   or credit for Taxes, (c) conducting any Tax Proceeding or (d)
   determining an allocation of Taxes between a Pre-Closing Period and
   Post-Closing Period.  Such cooperation and information will include
   making available copies of all relevant portions of relevant Tax
   Returns, together with all relevant portions of relevant accompanying
   schedules and relevant work papers, relevant documents relating to
   rulings or other determinations by taxing authorities and relevant
   records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property and other
   information, that any such party may possess.  Each party will retain
   all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, and all material records
   and other documents relating to Tax matters, of the relevant entities

                                    -76-







   for their respective Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing
   Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations, including
   extensions thereto consent to by such party or with respect to which
   such party shall have received written notice, plus 30 calendar days,
   for the Tax periods to which the Tax Returns and other documents
   relate.  Thereafter, the party holding such Tax Returns or other
   documents may dispose of them after offering the other party
   reasonable notice and opportunity to take possession of such Tax
   Returns and other documents at such other party's own expense.  Each
   party will make its employees reasonably available on a mutually
   convenient basis at its cost to provide explanation of any documents
   or information so provided.

             SECTION 10.6   TIMING DIFFERENCES.  Purchaser agrees that if
   as a result of any audit adjustment (or adjustment in any other Tax
   Proceeding) made with respect to any Tax Item that relates to or
   affects any Excluded Tax, by any taxing authority with respect to a
   Pre-Closing Period, Purchaser, any Subsidiary Purchaser of any
   Acquired Company, actually realizes a reduction in cash Taxes payable
   in a Post-Closing Period and such reduction exceeds $1,000,000, then
   Purchaser, such Subsidiary Purchaser or such Acquired Company will pay
   to Seller the amount of such reduction within fifteen calendar days of
   filing the Tax Return in which such reduction is realized or utilized.
   If as a result of the foregoing audit adjustment Purchaser incurs any
   additional Tax and such additional Tax exceeds $1,000,000, then Seller
   will pay to Purchaser the amount of such additional Tax within fifteen
   calendar days of the due date for making payment of such additional
   Tax.  For purposes of determining the amount and timing of any
   reduction in cash Taxes payable or any additional Tax incurred by
   Purchaser, any Subsidiary Purchaser and any Acquired Company as a
   result of any such adjustment, such amount shall be deemed to equal
   the difference between the amount of Tax payable by Purchaser, any
   Subsidiary Purchaser or an Acquired Company, as the case may be,
   taking into account such adjustment and the Taxes that would have been
   payable by Purchaser, any Subsidiary Purchaser or an Acquired Company,
   as the case may be, if such adjustment had not occurred.  If Purchaser
   shall have made a payment pursuant to this Section 10.6 and Purchaser,
   any Subsidiary Purchaser or any Acquired Company shall thereafter lose
   all or any portion of the benefit of any reduction in cash Taxes
   payable that resulted from the adjustment that gave rise to such
   payment (it being understood that a reduction in cash Taxes payable
   shall not be considered to be lost as a result of the inability of
   Purchaser, any Subsidiary Purchaser or any Acquired Company to carry
   back a net operating loss to the taxable year such reduction in cash
   Taxes payable was realized), Seller shall repay to Purchaser the
   amount of such lost reduction in cash Taxes payable within 15 days of
   receipt of notice from Purchaser specifying in reasonable detail the
   amount of such lost reduction.  Nothing in this SECTION 10.6 shall
   have any effect on the rights and obligations of the parties under the
   remainder of this ARTICLE X.



                                    -77-







             SECTION 10.7   CERTAIN DEFINITIONS.  For purposes of this
   Agreement:

             (a)  "Controlling Party" means (i) with respect to Tax
   Proceedings described in SECTION 10.4(b), Seller, (ii) with respect to
   Tax Proceedings described in SECTION 10.4(c), whichever of Seller or
   Purchaser is reasonably expected to bear the greater Tax liability in
   connection with a Straddle Period Tax Proceeding, and (iii) with
   respect to Tax Proceedings described in SECTION 10.4(d), Purchaser;

             (b)  "Excluded Taxes" means (a) any Taxes imposed on or
   payable with respect to any of the Acquired Companies or the Business
   for any Pre-Closing Period (other than Taxes imposed with respect to
   the Acquired Companies or the Business resulting from any act or
   transaction by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the
   Acquired Companies) after the Closing that is not in the Ordinary
   Course of Business), (b) any Taxes of Seller or any of its Affiliates
   for which the Acquired Companies may be liable under Section 1.1502-6
   of the Treasury Regulations (or any similar provision of state, local,
   or non-U.S. Tax law), (c) any Taxes (other than the transfer and other
   Taxes that are the subject of Section 10.1(c)) that result from or
   that would not have been imposed but for the inaccuracy or breach of
   any representation, warranty or covenant of Seller in this Agreement
   with respect to any Tax and (d) any Taxes that result from or would
   not have been imposed but for the making of a Section 338(h)(10)
   Election or any similar election under state or local law, regardless
   of the taxable period in which such Tax arises.  For purposes hereof,
   in the case of any period that begins before and ends after the
   Closing Date, (i) Property Taxes of the Acquired Companies or the
   Business allocable to the Pre-Closing Period will be equal to the
   amount of such Property Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a
   fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days during
   such period that are in the Pre-Closing Period and the denominator of
   which is the number of calendar days in the entire period, and (ii)
   Taxes (other than Property Taxes) of the Acquired Companies or the
   Business allocable to the Pre-Closing Period will be computed as if
   such taxable period ended on the Closing Date;

             (c)  "Non-Controlling Party" means whichever of Seller or
   Purchaser is not the Controlling Party with respect to a Tax
   Proceeding described in SECTION 10.4;

             (d)  "Post-Closing Period" means any taxable period (or
   portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date;

             (e)  "Pre-Closing Period" means any taxable period (or
   portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date;

             (f)  "Property Taxes" means real, personal, and intangible
   ad valorem property Taxes;



                                    -78-







             (g)  "Straddle Period Tax Return" means any Tax Return with
   respect to a taxable period beginning on or prior to and ending after
   the Closing Date;

             (h)  "Tax Claim" means any claim with respect to Taxes made
   by any taxing authority that, if pursued successfully, would
   reasonably be expected to serve as the basis for a claim for
   indemnification under this ARTICLE X; and

             (i)  "Tax Item" means any item of income, gain, loss,
   deduction, credit, recapture of credit or any other item that
   increases or decreases Taxes paid or payable.

             SECTION 10.8   SURVIVAL.  The representations and warranties
   set forth in SECTION 4.15 and the obligations of Seller, Purchaser and
   their respective Affiliates pursuant to this ARTICLE X shall survive
   the Closing Date and will terminate 90 calendar days after the
   expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including
   extensions thereof).

                                 ARTICLE XI
                                 TERMINATION

             SECTION 11.1   TERMINATION.  Anything herein or elsewhere to
   the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and the
   transactions contemplated herein may be abandoned at any time prior to
   the Closing:

             (a)  By the mutual consent of Seller and Purchaser;

             (b)  By either Seller or Purchaser:

                  (i)  If the Closing will not have occurred on or prior
        to the 90th day after the date hereof; or

                  (ii)  If any Governmental Authority will have issued an
        order, decree or ruling or taken any other action, in each case
        permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
        material transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such
        order, decree, ruling or other action will have become final and
        non-appealable, or there shall be an applicable statute, rule or
        regulation which makes all or any material portion of the
        purchase and sale of the Purchased Shares or the Purchased Assets
        contemplated hereby illegal or otherwise prohibited;

        PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the party seeking termination pursuant to
        this clause (b) of this SECTION 11.1 is not in breach in any
        material respect of any of its representations, warranties,
        covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

             (c)  By Seller in the event of a material breach of any
   covenant or agreement to be performed or complied with by Purchaser

                                    -79-







   pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or of any representation or
   warranty of Purchaser contained in this Agreement, which breach (i)
   has continued without cure for a period of 30 days following written
   notice thereof by Seller to Purchaser or if such breach cannot be
   cured and (ii) would result in a condition to Closing set forth in
   SECTION 8.2 of this Agreement not being satisfied (which condition has
   not been waived by Seller in writing); or

             (d)  By Purchaser in the event of a material breach of any
   covenant or agreement to be performed or complied with by Seller
   pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or of any representation or
   warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement, which breach (i) has
   continued without cure for a period of 30 days following written
   notice thereof by Purchaser to Seller or if such breach cannot be
   cured and (ii) would result in a condition to Closing set forth in
   SECTION 8.1 of this Agreement not being satisfied (which condition has
   not been waived by Purchaser in writing).

             SECTION 11.2   EFFECT OF TERMINATION.  In the event that
   this Agreement is terminated by Seller or Purchaser pursuant to
   SECTION 11.1, Written notice thereof will forthwith be given to the
   other and all further obligations of the parties hereto under this
   Agreement (other than pursuant to SECTION 6.6(a), this Section 11.2
   and SECTIONS 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 12.9 and 12.11, all
   of which will continue in full force and effect) will terminate
   without further action by any party and without liability or other
   obligation of either party to the other party hereunder; PROVIDED,
   HOWEVER, that no party will be released from liability hereunder if
   this Agreement is terminated and the transactions abandoned by reason
   of (a) any breach, as of the date of this Agreement, of any
   representation or warranty made by such party, (b) any breach of any
   covenant or agreement to be performed or complied with by such party
   or (c) any willful breach of this Agreement.

                                 ARTICLE XII
                                MISCELLANEOUS

             SECTION 12.1   EXPENSES.  Whether or not the transactions
   contemplated hereby are consummated, and except as otherwise expressly
   provided herein, the parties hereto will pay all of their own costs
   and expenses relating to the transactions contemplated by this
   Agreement, including the costs and expenses of their respective
   counsel, financial advisors and accountants.

             SECTION 12.2   GOVERNING LAW; CONSENT TO JURISDICTION.

             (a)  The interpretation and construction of this Agreement,
   and all matters relating hereto, will be governed by the laws of the
   State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed
   entirely within the State of New York without giving effect to any
   conflict of law provisions thereof, except that, notwithstanding
   clause (b) below, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Section 1-16,

                                    -80-







   will govern all issues relating to the arbitrability and arbitration
   of any claim or dispute relating to, and any interpretation of,
   SECTION 2.3 or 2.4 and the enforcement of any determination pursuant
   thereto.

             (b)  Each of the parties agrees that any legal action or
   proceeding with respect to this Agreement may be brought in the
   federal and state courts located in the State of New York, and, by
   execution and delivery of this Agreement, each party hereto hereby
   irrevocably submits itself in respect of its property, generally and
   unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts
   in any legal action or proceeding arising out of this Agreement.  Each
   of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it
   may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the
   aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of or in connection with
   this Agreement brought in the courts referred to in the preceding
   sentence.  Each party hereto hereby consents to process being served
   in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of a copy thereof to

   that such service upon receipt will constitute good and sufficient
   service of process or notice thereof.  Nothing in this paragraph will

   action or other proceeding brought by any party hereto against any
   other party or parties hereto with respect to any matter arising out
   of, or in any way connected with or related to, this Agreement or any
   portion thereof, whether based upon contractual, statutory, tortious
   or other theories of liability.  Each party represents that it has
   consulted with counsel regarding the meaning and effect of the
   foregoing waiver of its right to a jury trial.
