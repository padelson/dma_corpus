Calculation Certificate to the Purchaser no later than ninety (90) days
following the Closing Date.

give the Seller and its Representatives such assistance and access to the
books and records of the Purchaser relating to the Target Business as the

to prepare the Calculation Certificate. The Purchaser shall be provided
promptly with copies of the working papers created by the Seller and its
Representatives in connection with the preparation of the Calculation
Certificate as the Purchaser may reasonably request in respect of its review
of the Closing Date Adjustment.

  

  

(3) Deemed Acceptance. If the Purchaser does not give a notice of objection in
accordance with Section 2.6, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted
the Calculation Certificate prepared by the Seller, which shall be final and
binding on the Parties and the calculation of the Closing Date Adjustment
shall constitute the final Closing Date Adjustment for the purposes of this
Agreement immediately following the expiry date for the giving of such notice
of objection.

  

  

2.6 Dispute Settlement. If the Purchaser objects to any matter in the
Calculation Certificate prepared pursuant to Section 2.5, the Purchaser shall
give notice to the Seller no later than thirty (30) days after delivery of the
Calculation Certificate. Any notice given by the Purchaser shall set forth in
reasonable detail the particulars of such objection. The Purchaser and the
Seller shall then use reasonable efforts to resolve such objection for a
period of thirty (30) days following the giving of such notice. If the matter
is not resolved by the end of such thirty (30) day period, then the dispute
with respect to such objection shall be submitted by the Parties to a
chartered accountant, agreed to by the Parties, associated with the Canadian
office of one of the big four international accounting firms that is not the
principal auditor of any Party at such time, which chartered accountant shall
have no current or prior professional relationship with any Party (the
"Independent Accountant"). If the Seller and the Purchaser are unable to agree
on the identity of the Independent Accountant within a further ten (10) day
period, either the Seller or the Purchaser may apply to have a court appoint
the Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant shall, as promptly as
practicable (but in any event within forty-five (45) days following its
appointment), in its capacity as an expert and not as an arbitrator, make a
determination of the Closing Date Adjustment based solely on written
submissions of the Purchaser and the Seller given by them to the Independent
Accountant and any other information that is reasonably requested from such
Parties by the Independent Accountant. The submissions of the Purchaser and
the Seller shall be disclosed to the other Party, respectively, and such other
Party shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to respond thereto. The
Purchaser and the Seller

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  

 

- 29 -

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

shall provide the Independent Accountant with all information it requests that
is within such Party's control as promptly as possible. The decision of the
Independent Accountant as to the Closing Date Adjustment shall be final and
binding upon the Purchaser and the Seller and shall constitute the final
Closing Date Adjustment for purposes of this Agreement. Except in the case of
fraud or manifest error, the Purchaser and the Seller each acknowledge and
agree that it does not have the right to appeal a decision of the Independent
Accountant made pursuant to this Section 2.6. The Purchaser and the Seller
shall each pay one-half of the fees and expenses payable to the Independent
Accountant pursuant to this Section 2.6 unless the Independent Accountant
determines, in its sole discretion, that the submissions or actions of the
Purchaser and the Seller, as the case may be, warrants that such Party should
pay more than one-half (1/2) of such fees and expenses, in which case such
fees and expenses shall be paid by the Purchaser and the Seller in the
proportions determined by the Independent Accountant.

  

  

2.7 Payment of Estimated Purchase Price. The Purchaser shall pay the Estimated
Purchase Price on the Closing Date by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account of the Seller identified by the Seller to the Purchaser

pay to the Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an
account of the Purchaser as identified by the Purchaser to the Seller by
written notice no later than four (4) Business Days prior to the Adjustment

or Section 2.9(3) being a "Tax Litigation Certificate") setting forth its
calculation of the Tax Litigation Result. The Seller shall deliver the Tax
Litigation Certificate to the Purchaser for its review. The Purchaser shall be
provided promptly with copies of the working papers created by the Seller in
connection with the preparation of the Tax Litigation Certificate, such access
to the books and records of SCDA (including for greater certainty any relevant
branch that is or was maintained by SCDA outside Canada), and such other
assistance as the Purchaser may reasonably request in respect of its review of
the Tax Litigation Certificate.

  

  

(2) Pre-Closing Deemed Acceptance. If a Tax Litigation Certificate has been
prepared and delivered by the Seller to the Purchaser in accordance with
Section 2.9(1), and the Purchaser does not give a notice of objection in
accordance with Section 2.9(5), the Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted
the Tax Litigation Certificate prepared by the Seller, which

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  

 

- 30 -

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

shall be final and binding on the Parties and the calculation of the Tax
Litigation Result reflected in such Tax Litigation Certificate shall
constitute the final Tax Litigation Result for the purposes of this Agreement
immediately following the expiry date for the giving of such notice of
objection.

  

  

(3) Post-Closing Tax Litigation Adjustment. After the Final Settlement is
determined in accordance with Section 7.10(Tax Litigation), and provided such
Final Settlement is determined after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
prepare a Tax Litigation Certificate setting forth its calculation of the Tax
Litigation Result. The Purchaser shall deliver the Tax Litigation Certificate
to the Seller for its review. The Seller shall be provided promptly with
copies of the working papers created by the Purchaser in connection with the
preparation of the Tax Litigation Certificate, such access to the books and
records of SCDA (including for greater certainty any relevant branch that is
or was maintained by SCDA outside Canada), and such other assistance as the

Section 2.9(3), and the Seller does not give a notice of objection in
accordance with Section 2.9(5), the Seller shall be deemed to have accepted
the Tax Litigation Certificate prepared by the Purchaser, which shall be final
and binding on the Parties and the calculation of the Tax Litigation Result
reflected in such Tax Litigation Certificate shall constitute the final Tax
Litigation Result for the purposes of this Agreement immediately following the
expiry date for the giving of such notice of objection.

  

  

(5) Tax Dispute Resolution. If either Party (the "Objecting Party") objects to
any matter in the Tax Litigation Certificate prepared by the other Party (the
"Preparing Party") pursuant to Section 2.9(1) or 2.9(3), as the case may be,
the Objecting Party shall give notice to the Preparing Party no later than
thirty (30) days after delivery of the Tax Litigation Certificate. Any notice
given by the Objecting Party shall set forth in reasonable detail the
particulars of such objection. The Purchaser and the Seller shall then use
reasonable efforts to resolve such objection for a period of thirty (30) days
following the giving of such notice. If the matter is not resolved by the end
of such thirty (30) day period, then the dispute with respect to such
objection shall be submitted by the Parties to a tax specialist, agreed to by
the Parties, associated with the Canadian office of one of the big four
international accounting firms that is not the principal auditor of any Party
at such time, which tax specialist shall have no current or prior professional
relationship with any Party (the "Independent Litigation Accountant"). If the
Seller and the Purchaser are unable to agree on the identity of the
Independent Litigation Accountant within a further ten (10) day period, either
the Seller or the Purchaser may apply to have a court appoint the Independent
Litigation Accountant. The Independent Litigation Accountant shall, as
promptly as practicable (but in any event within forty-five (45) days
following its appointment), in its capacity as an expert and not as an
arbitrator, make a determination of the Tax Litigation Result based solely on
written submissions of the Purchaser and the Seller given by them to the
Independent Litigation Accountant and any other information that is reasonably
requested from such Parties by the Independent Litigation Accountant. The
submissions of the Purchaser and the Seller shall be disclosed to the other
Party, respectively, and such other Party shall be afforded a reasonable
opportunity to respond thereto. The Purchaser and the Seller shall provide the
Independent Litigation Accountant with all information it requests that is
within such Party's control as promptly as possible. The decision of the
Independent Litigation Accountant as to the Tax Litigation Result shall be
final and binding upon the Purchaser and the Seller and shall

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  

 

- 31 -

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

constitute the final Tax Litigation Result for purposes of this Agreement.
Except in the case of fraud or manifest error, the Purchaser and the Seller
each acknowledge and agree that it does not have the right to appeal a
decision of the Independent Litigation Accountant made pursuant to this
Section 2.9(5). The Purchaser and the Seller shall each pay one-half of the
fees and expenses payable to the Independent Litigation Accountant pursuant to
this Section 2.9(5) unless the Independent Litigation Accountant determines,
in its sole discretion, that the submissions or actions of the Purchaser and
the Seller, as the case may be, warrants that such Party should pay more than
one-half of such fees and expenses, in which case such fees and expenses shall
be paid by the Purchaser and the Seller in the proportions determined by the
Independent Litigation Accountant.

  

  

(6) Payment of Tax Litigation Adjustment Amount. Within five (5) days after
the Tax Litigation Result is finally determined in accordance with Section
2.9(2), 2.9(4) or 2.9(5), as the case may be, (but no earlier than the Closing
Date), (i) if the Tax Litigation Result is greater than the Tax Litigation
Base Amount, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount equal to one-half (1/2) of the
applicable Tax Litigation Adjustment Amount and (ii) if the Tax Litigation
Result is less than the Tax Litigation Base Amount, the Seller shall pay to
the Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount
equal to one-half (1/2) of the applicable Tax Litigation Adjustment Amount.

  

  

2.10 Excluded Assets. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, except as
specifically provided for in this Agreement or any Transaction Agreement, the
Purchaser is not acquiring any rights in any Excluded Assets.

  

  

2.11 Canadian Tax Matters.

  

  

(1) No Withholding on Purchase Price. Based and relying on the Surviving Tax
Representations, the Purchaser agrees that it is not required to and shall not
withhold Canadian federal or provincial tax under section 116 of the ITA or
Title III of Part II of the TAQ from any payment of the Purchase Price, the
Estimated Purchase Price or any adjustment to the Purchase Price hereunder,
unless the Seller has not delivered to the Purchaser the certificate referred
to in Section 4.2(o)(Closing Deliveries of the Seller) on Closing. The
Purchaser shall file within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, on a
"protective" basis (that is, without taking a position that the Target Shares
or any of them are "taxable Canadian property" or "taxable Quebec property"),
both a notice under sub-section 116(5.02) of the ITA and a notice under
section 1101.2 of the TAQ in respect of the acquisition of the Target Shares.

  

  

(2) Directed Amount. The Seller agrees to pay on behalf of SLAL, out of the
funds directed to the Seller by SLAL under Section 4.2(l)(Closing Deliveries
of Seller), an amount equal to [Redacted amount](the "Directed Amount"), being
[Redacted amount] of the SLAL Deemed Dividend, in the manner provided for in
Section 4.2(l)(Closing Deliveries of the Seller), Section 4.3(b)(Closing
Deliveries of the Purchaser) and Section 4.4(Tax Remittance), on account of
SLAL's obligation to pay the SLAL Deemed Dividend Tax. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the governments of the United Kingdom and Canada enter into an
agreement, after the date hereof and before the Closing Date, to amend Article
10(2)(a) of the Convention, with effect on or prior to the Closing Date, then
the Directed Amount shall be determined as the lowest percentage rate of
withholding provided for in any successor provision to such Article 10(2)(a),
applied to the SLAL Deemed Dividend, unless such lowest percentage shall be
manifestly

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  

 

- 32 -

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

inapplicable to the SLAL Deemed Dividend in light of the terms and conditions
provided for in such successor provision for such lowest percentage rate, in
which case the Seller and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith the
percentage rate of withholding to be applied.

  

  

(3) No Withholding on Account of SLAL Deemed Dividend. Having regard to
Section 2.11(2), Section 7.1(iii)(Tax Indemnity) and Section 7.12(SLAL Deemed
Dividend Tax), and without precluding the Purchaser from making a claim for
indemnification in respect of the SLAL Deemed Dividend under such provisions,
the Purchaser agrees that it is not required to and shall not withhold
Canadian federal or provincial tax on account of the SLAL Deemed Dividend from
any payment of the Purchase Price, the Estimated Purchase Price or any
adjustment to the Purchase Price hereunder, except that the Purchaser shall
make the directed payment to SCDA provided for in Section 4.3(b) and shall
cause SCDA to effect the remittance to the Canada Revenue Agency contemplated
in Section 4.4.

to the Seller and the Parent entering into this Agreement and completing the

entering into this Agreement in reliance upon the representations and
warranties of the Purchaser set out in this Section 3.2, the Purchaser

- 61 -

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

Date other than in respect of the Purchaser Fundamental Representations which
the Purchaser represents and warrants as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing Date:

  

  

(1) Incorporation and Corporate Power. The Purchaser is incorporated,
organized and subsisting under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation. The Purchaser has the corporate power, authority and capacity
to execute and deliver this Agreement and each Transaction Agreement to which
it is a party and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder.

  

  

(2) Purchaser Solvency. No proceedings have been taken or authorized by the
Purchaser or, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, by any other Person, with
respect to the bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or winding-up
of the Purchaser.

  

  

(3) Authorization by Purchaser. The Purchaser has taken all corporate action
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of, and the observance and
performance of its covenants and obligations under this Agreement and each
Transaction Agreement to which it will be a party.

  

  

(4) Enforceability of Obligations. This Agreement constitutes, and each
Transaction Agreement to which the Purchaser will be a party will on Closing
constitute, subject to obtaining the Regulatory Approvals required to be
obtained by the Purchaser and assuming the due and valid authorization,
execution and delivery hereof by the Seller and the due and valid
authorization, execution and delivery of the Transaction Agreements by the
Seller or its Affiliates who are party to the Transaction Agreements, as
applicable, a valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser in accordance with
its terms, subject to the Enforcement Exceptions.

  

  

(5) Absence of Conflicts. Subject to obtaining the Regulatory Approvals, the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Transaction
Agreements by the Purchaser does not result in or constitute and in the case
of the Transaction Agreements, will not result in or constitute on Closing,
any of the following:

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |  

a default, breach or violation or an event that, with notice or lapse of time
or both, would be a material default, breach or violation of any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of the articles or by-laws of the Purchaser; or

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |  

a material violation of any Applicable Law.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(6) Knowledge and Experience. In connection with its decision to enter into
this Agreement and the Transaction Agreements, the Purchaser acknowledges
that:

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |  

it is a sophisticated party with such knowledge and experience in business
matters that it appreciates the merits and risks of acquiring the Target
Shares, consummating the Proposed Transactions and operating the Target
Business; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(b)

it has conducted, to its satisfaction, its own due diligence investigation in
respect of the Transferred Entities and the Target Business and has had the

respect to any information it has deemed material.

- 62 -

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

(7) Regulatory Approvals. Except as listed at Section 3.2(7) of the Purchaser
Disclosure Letter, no Regulatory Approval or filing with any Governmental
Authority is required to be obtained or made by the Purchaser in connection
with the execution and delivery of, and performance by the Purchaser of its
obligations under this Agreement or the Transaction Agreements other than any
Regulatory Approval or notice the failure of which to obtain or make would not
reasonably be likely to result in a material adverse effect on the Purchaser.

  

  

(8) Sufficient Funds. The Purchaser will, at Closing, be able to fund the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all of the
consideration payable as required by this Agreement and the Transaction
Agreements.

  

  

(9) Mutual Funds. The Purchaser has no present intention of taking any action
within a reasonable time period following the acquisition of the control of
the securities of SLMF that could reasonably be expected to be considered by
one or more Securities Authorities as a change of manager of any Standard Life
Mutual Fund rather than a change of control of manager, including by reason of
considerations described in OSC Staff Notice 81-710, and thereby trigger a
requirement for SLMF to call, prior to the Closing, security holder meetings
of any Standard Life Mutual Funds (each, a "Standard Life Mutual Fund
Meeting") to obtain approval of the Proposed Transactions, and the Purchaser
acknowledges that the Seller is relying on this representation in order to
refrain from calling, prior to Closing, any Standard Life Mutual Fund Meetings
to obtain approval of the Proposed Transactions; provided, however, that the
Purchaser shall not be precluded from calling security holder meetings
following the Closing to obtain any necessary approvals prior to implementing
any material changes to the manager or operations of the Standard Life Mutual
Funds.

  

  

(10) Investment Canada Act. The Purchaser is not a non-Canadian for the
purposes of the Investment Canada Act (Canada).

  

  

(11) Securities Authorities. Neither the Ultimate Designated Person (as such
term is defined by Securities Authorities) nor the Chief Compliance Officer of
Manulife Asset Management Limited is aware of any reason or circumstance why
the Purchaser would not expect to obtain the Ontario and Quebec Securities
Approvals in the ordinary course prior to the Outside Date or why the Ontario
or Quebec Securities Authorities would delay any such approvals on account of
the identity of the Purchaser.

  

  

3.3 Commissions. Each Party represents and warrants to the other Party that
such other Party will not be liable for any brokerage commission, finder's fee
or other similar payment in connection with the Proposed Transactions because
of any action taken, or agreement or understanding reached, by that Party.

  

  

3.4 No Other Representations and Warranties.

representation as to, and neither it nor any of its

respect of, the accuracy or reasonableness of any forecasts, estimates,
projections, statements of intent or statements of opinion provided to the
Purchaser, any of its Affiliates, or any of their respective Representatives
on or prior to the date of this Agreement, any management presentations and
any other information made available in the Virtual Data Room. The Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.1, neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates is
making any representation or warranty regarding any documents, projections,
forecasts, statement or other information made, communicated or furnished,
whether orally, in writing, in the Virtual Data Room, in management
presentations, including any questions posed and answers given and any related
discussions, whether formal or informal, or otherwise, to the Purchaser, any
of its Affiliates, or any of their respective Representatives (including any
opinion, information, projection or advice that may have been or may be
provided to such Person by any Representatives of the Seller or any of its
Affiliates) in respect of the subject matter herein. The Purchaser

(b)

  |  

The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Seller has not made any
representation or warranty whatsoever that the amount of the General
Investment Assets will be adequate to satisfy the Policy Liabilities and
notwithstanding anything otherwise contained in this Agreement, no provision
of this Agreement shall be construed as constituting, directly or indirectly,
such a representation or warranty and neither the Seller nor any of its
Affiliates shall be under any liability to the Purchaser in respect of any
inadequacy of the General Investment Assets to satisfy the Policy Liabilities,
provided that, for greater certainty, the provisions of this sentence shall
not limit or restrict the representations and warranties contained in Sections
3.1(18) and 3.1(19). The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the amount of
the Policy Liabilities are based upon an estimate (which requires the use of,
amongst other things, assumptions, judgement and actuarial principles) of
levels of settlement of claims. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the
lack of adequacy of the General Investment Assets to satisfy the Policy
Liabilities (including where any estimate, judgement, assumption or
application of actuarial principles resulted in such inadequacy) may not be
used, directly or indirectly, to demonstrate or support a claim of breach of
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement in respect of such
lack of adequacy, provided that, for greater certainty, the provisions of this
sentence shall not limit or restrict the representations and warranties
contained in Sections 3.1(18) and 3.1(19). The Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that it has been given the opportunity to assess, and have its
Representatives assess, the adequacy of the General Investment Assets to
satisfy the Policy Liabilities.

ARTICLE 5

  

CONDITIONS OF CLOSING

  

  

5.1 Purchaser's Conditions. The Purchaser shall not be obligated to complete
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the purchase of the
Target Shares, unless, at or before the Closing, each of the conditions listed
below in this Section 5.1 has been satisfied, it being understood that such
conditions are included for the exclusive benefit of the Purchaser. The Seller
shall take all such actions, steps and proceedings as are reasonably within
its control as may be necessary to ensure that the conditions listed below in
this Section 5.1 are fulfilled at or before the Closing.

  

  

(1) Representations and Warranties. The Seller Fundamental Representations
shall be true and correct at the Closing except where the failure to be so
true and correct would not give rise to a Material Adverse Effect.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in circumstances where such failure or related
breach would give rise to a Material Adverse Effect but such Material Adverse
Effect could be cured, the Seller shall use reasonable best efforts, and the
Purchaser shall provide such assistance as reasonably requested by the Seller
(at the Seller's expense), to cure the failure or related breach and the
Parties shall delay Closing until such date as such failure or related breach
is cured, provided that such date is not after the Outside Date.

  

  

(2) Seller's Compliance. The Seller shall have performed and complied in all
respects with the terms and conditions in this Agreement on its part to be
performed or complied with at or before the Closing except where the failure
to do so would not give rise to a Material Adverse Effect. If the failure of
the Seller to perform and comply with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement would give rise to a Material Adverse Effect but such Material
Adverse Effect could be cured by the Seller or addressed by monetary
compensation, the Seller shall use reasonable best efforts, and the Purchaser
shall provide such assistance as reasonably requested by the Seller (at the
Seller's expense), to cure or so address such failure and the Parties shall
delay Closing until such date as such failure is cured or so addressed,
provided that such date is not after the Outside Date.

  

  

(3) No Law. Subject to Section 5.5 (Legal Proceedings or Change in Law),
during the Interim Period, no Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction
has enacted, issued, promulgated or revised any Law (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that would have a material adverse effect on the
ability of the Parties to consummate the Proposed Transactions.

  

  

(4) Required Regulatory Approvals. The Required Regulatory Approvals shall
have been obtained.

  

  

(5) Pending or Threatened Legal Proceedings. Subject to Section 5.5, there
shall be no Order enjoining, materially restricting or prohibiting the
consummation of the Proposed Transactions, nor any Legal Proceeding pending by
any Person that would reasonably be expected to enjoin, materially restrict or
prohibit consummation of the Proposed Transactions.

  

  

5.2 Condition Not Fulfilled. If any condition in Section 5.1 has not been
fulfilled at or before the Outside Date or if any such condition is or becomes
impossible to satisfy, other than as a result of (i) the failure of the
Purchaser to comply with its obligations, or (ii) a breach by the Purchaser of
its representations and warranties under this Agreement that has been the
cause of

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  

 

- 68 -

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur by the Outside Date, then

remedies available to the Purchaser at law or in equity, either:

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |

---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(b)

representation, warranty, covenant or condition contained in this Agreement.

benefit of the Seller. The Purchaser shall take all such actions, steps and
proceedings as are reasonably within the Purchaser's control as may be
necessary to ensure that the conditions listed below in this Section 5.3 are
fulfilled at or before the Closing.

  

  

(1) Representations and Warranties. The Purchaser Fundamental Representations
shall be true and correct at the Closing except where the failure to be so
true and correct would not give rise to a material adverse effect on the
Purchaser's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement ("Purchaser Material Adverse Effect"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in circumstances where such failure or related breach would give
rise to a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect but such Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect could be cured, the Purchaser shall use reasonable best
efforts, and the Seller shall provide such assistance as reasonably requested
by the Purchaser (at the Purchaser's expense), to cure the failure or related
breach and the Parties shall delay Closing until such date as such failure or
related breach is cured, provided that such date is not after the Outside

(2) Purchaser's Compliance. The Purchaser shall have performed and complied in
all respects with the terms and conditions in this Agreement on its part to be
performed or complied with at or before the Closing except where the failure
to do so would not give rise to a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. If the
failure of the Purchaser to perform and comply with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement would give rise to a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect but
such Purchaser Material Adverse Effect could be cured by the Purchaser or
addressed by monetary compensation, the Purchaser shall use reasonable best
efforts, and the Seller shall provide such assistance as reasonably requested
by the Purchaser (at the Purchaser's expense), to cure or so address such
failure and the Parties shall delay Closing until such date as such failure is
cured or so addressed, provided that such date is not after the Outside Date.

(5) Pending or Threatened Legal Proceedings. Subject to Section 5.5, there

prohibit consummation of the Proposed Transactions.

  

  

(6) Support Principle Letter. The support principle letter delivered by the
Parent to OSFI in respect of the Canadian operations of SCDA shall have been
returned to SCDA by the Superintendent or OSFI shall have confirmed in writing

to comply with its obligations, or (ii) a breach by the Seller of its
representations and warranties under this Agreement that has been the cause of
or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur by the Outside Date, then
the Seller in its sole discretion, without limiting any rights or remedies
available to the Seller at law or in equity, may either:

  

  

    

  |

  |  

terminate this Agreement by written notice to the Purchaser; or

representation, warranty, covenant or condition contained in this Agreement.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

5.5 Legal Proceedings or Changes in Law.

  

  

(1) Pending or Threatened Legal Proceedings. In the event that there is any
Legal Proceeding pending or Threatened by any Person or any Order that would
reasonably be expected to enjoin, materially restrict or prohibit consummation
of the Proposed Transactions, the Parties shall co-operate and use their
reasonable best efforts to resolve or have dismissed any such Legal Proceeding
or have vacated such Order as quickly as practicable. The Parties shall
postpone the Closing to a date (prior to the Outside Date) after such Legal
Proceeding has been resolved or dismissed and Order vacated unless the Parties
otherwise agree in writing to proceed to Closing.

  

  

(2) Changes in Law.

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |

revised any Law (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that explicitly
prohibits or delays the consummation of certain material (but not all) aspects
of the Proposed Transactions to be completed at or before the Closing, the
Parties, subject to Section 5.5(2)(b), acting in good faith, shall use their
reasonable best efforts for a reasonable period of time to negotiate
amendments to this Agreement and any applicable Transaction Agreement and any
new agreement that may be required such that those aspects of the Proposed
Transactions that are not

- 70 -

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

 

  

    

  |  

  |  

prohibited by such change in Law may be completed in a timely manner. The
Parties shall postpone the Closing to a date (prior to the Outside Date) after
such amendments and new agreements, if applicable, have been settled.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

 

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |

shares in the share capital of SCDA and SLI Canada, (ii) transfer to and
assumption by the Purchaser of all or substantially all of the assets and
liabilities of SCDA and SLI Canada.

6.4 Notice of Claim.

  

  

(1) Notice. If an Indemnified Party becomes aware of any act, omission, state
of facts or circumstances that may give rise to Losses in respect of which a
right of indemnification is provided for under this Article 6 (including a
Threatened claim or demand asserted in writing by a Third Party), the
Indemnified Party shall promptly (but, in any event, in the case of Third
Party Claims, within ten (10) days of receipt of a notice of a Third Party
Claim) give written notice thereof (a "Notice of Claim") to the Indemnifying
Party. The Notice of Claim shall specify whether such potential Losses
(including contingent Losses that have not at the time of the Notice become an
actual liability of the Indemnified Party) arise as a result of a claim by a
Third Party against the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim", which shall,
for the avoidance of doubt, exclude any claim indemnifiable under Section 7.1
(Tax Indemnity)) or whether the

  

  

  

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  

 

- 72 -

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

potential Losses do not so arise (a "Direct Claim", which shall, for the
avoidance of doubt, also exclude any claim indemnifiable under Section 7.1
(Tax Indemnity)), and shall also specify, in each case, with reasonable
particularity (to the extent that the information is available):

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |  

the factual basis for the Direct Claim or Third Party Claim, as the case may
be;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |  

the specific sections of this Agreement pursuant to which indemnification is
being sought;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(c)

  |  

the estimated amount of the potential Losses arising therefrom; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(d)

  |  

such other information as is reasonably necessary to enable the Indemnifying
Party to assess the merits of the potential claim.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(2) Reduction of Liability. If, through the fault of the Indemnified Party,
the Indemnifying Party does not receive a Notice of Claim in time effectively
to contest the determination of any liability susceptible of being contested
or to assert a right to recover an amount under applicable insurance coverage
or by exercising any other right against any other Person, then the liability
of the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party under this Article 6 shall
be reduced only to the extent that Losses are actually incurred by the
Indemnifying Party or the Losses of the Indemnified Party are increased, in
either case, resulting from the Indemnified Party's failure to give the Notice
of Claim on a timely basis. Nothing in Section 6.4(1) shall be construed to
affect the time within which a Notice of Claim must be delivered pursuant to
Section 6.5 in order to permit recovery pursuant to Section 6.5.

  

  

6.5 Time Limits for Delivery of Notice of Claim.

  

  

(1) Notice by the Purchaser.

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |

6.6 Monetary Limits on Losses.

  

  

(1) Losses of the Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, (i) the Seller shall not be liable for any amounts
for which the Purchaser is otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 6.2(a), Section 6.2(b) and Section 7.1(i) and/or under the
indemnification provisions of the Business Transfer Agreement unless the
aggregate amount of all Losses for which the Purchaser is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 6.2(a), Section 6.2(b) and Section 7.1(i),
and/or under the indemnification provisions of the Business Transfer Agreement
exceeds, on a cumulative basis, one and a half percent (1.5%) of the Purchase
Price (the "Aggregate Claim Threshold") and then only to the extent of such
excess, (ii) no Losses may be claimed by the Purchaser under Section 6.2(a),
Section 6.2(b) and Section 7.1(i) and/or under the indemnification provisions
of the Business Transfer Agreement, and no such Losses shall be included in
calculating the aggregate Losses set forth in clause (i) of this Section
6.6(1), other than such Losses in excess of two-hundred and fifty thousand
dollars ($250,000) (the "Individual Claim Threshold") resulting from any
single claim or aggregated claims arising out of the same facts, events or
circumstances, and (iii) the Seller shall not be required to make
indemnification payments pursuant to Section 6.2 (Indemnity by the Seller),
Section 7.1(i) and/or under the indemnification provisions of the Business
Transfer Agreement to the extent the indemnification payments thereunder would
exceed in the aggregate twenty percent (20%) of the Purchase Price (the
"Indemnity Cap"). The limitations in (i), (ii) and (iii) above shall not apply
to the extent any Losses arise as a result of wilful breach of this Agreement.

  

  

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  

 

- 74 -

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

(2) Losses of the Seller. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary, (i) the Purchaser shall not be liable for any amounts for
which the Seller is otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section
6.3(a), Section 6.3(b) and/or under the indemnification provisions of the
Business Transfer Agreement unless the aggregate amount of all Losses for
which the Seller is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 6.3(a),
Section 6.3(b) and/or under the indemnification provisions of the Business
Transfer Agreement exceeds, on a cumulative basis, the Aggregate Claim
Threshold and then only to the extent of such excess, (ii) no Losses may be
claimed by the Seller under Section 6.3(a) and/or under the indemnification
provisions of the Business Transfer Agreement, and no such Losses shall be
included in calculating the aggregate Losses set forth in clause (i) of this
Section 6.6(2), other than such Losses in excess of the Individual Claim
Threshold resulting from any single claim or aggregated claims arising out of
the same facts, events or circumstances, and (iii) the Purchaser shall not be
required to make indemnification payments pursuant to Section 6.3 (Indemnity
by the Purchaser) and/or under the indemnification provisions of the Business
Transfer Agreement to the extent the indemnification payments thereunder would
exceed in the aggregate the Indemnity Cap. The limitations in (i), (ii) and
(iii) above shall not apply to the extent any Losses arise as a result of
wilful breach of this Agreement. Such limitations shall have no application to
any claim to recover Losses based on the failure of the Purchaser to fulfill
its obligations pursuant to Article 2.

  

  

(3) Losses due to Changes. Neither Party shall be liable to the other Party
for any Losses for which the other Party would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article 6 or Article 7 if, and to the extent,
such Losses arise directly from, or are increased by, a change in Applicable
Law, applicable accounting or actuarial principles or any applicable
regulatory accounting or actuarial rules that was first announced or proposed
on or after the date hereof.

  

  

6.7 Direct Claims.

  

  

(1) Investigation. In the case of a Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
have sixty (60) days from receipt of a Notice of Claim in respect thereof
within which to make such investigation as the Indemnifying Party considers
necessary or desirable. For the purpose of such investigation, the Indemnified
Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party the information relied
upon by the Indemnified Party to substantiate its right to be indemnified
under this Article 6, together with all such other information as the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. If the Parties fail to agree to a
resolution of the claim at or before the expiration of such sixty (60) day
period (or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof), the Indemnified Party
shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to it.

  

  

(2) Time Limits. If an Indemnified Party has provided a Notice of Claim in
respect of a Direct Claim to the Indemnifying Party, unless otherwise agreed
to by the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party in writing, and to the
extent the Indemnified Party has not commenced a Legal Proceeding in respect
of such claim in a court of competent jurisdiction within twenty-four (24)
months of the date of delivery of the relevant Notice of Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to be indemnified by the Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Article 6 for any claimed Losses relating to such
Direct Claim except to the extent such claim is based on a liability which is
contingent or otherwise not capable of being quantified, in which case the

  

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  

 

- 75 -

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

twenty-four (24) month period shall commence on the date that the contingent
liability becomes an actual liability or the liability is capable of being
quantified.

  

  

6.8 Third Party Claims.

  

  

(1) Control of Defence. In the case of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall have sixty (60) days (or such lesser period as may be required by
Applicable Law to respond to the Notice of Claim) from receipt of a Notice of
Claim to elect, at its option, to exercise its right to assume and control the
defense of, at its own expense and by counsel of its own choosing, any such
Third Party Claim and shall be entitled to assert any and all defenses
available to the Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law.

  

  

(2) Cooperation. If the Indemnifying Party undertakes to compromise or defend
any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully with
the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the compromise of, or defense
against, any such Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include (i)
allowing the Indemnifying Party and its Representatives to investigate the
fact, matter, event or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Third Party
Claim and using commercially reasonable efforts to make available to the
Indemnifying Party its then current officers, directors and employees to act
as witnesses (including interviews, the preparation and submission of witness
statements and the giving of evidence at any required examination for
discovery or any related hearing), (ii) promptly furnishing all documentary
evidence in its possession or control relating to the Third Party Claim, (iii)
preserving all documentary evidence relating to the Third Party Claim, and
(iv) providing reasonable access to any other relevant Party, including any
Representatives of the Parties as reasonably needed; provided that, in each
case, such cooperation shall not unduly interfere with the operation of the
Indemnified Party's business. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle,
compromise or discharge any Third Party Claim, or enter any judgment arising
from, or with respect to, any such Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless the relief consists solely of money
Losses to be paid by the Indemnifying Party or unless the settlement,
compromise or discharge or entry of any judgment does not involve any finding
or admission of any violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing of the
Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding an election to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel and to monitor the defense of such Third Party Claim, and the
Indemnified Party shall bear the fees, costs and expenses of such separate
counsel. In any event, the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party and their
respective counsel shall cooperate in the defense of any such Third Party
Claim subject to this Article 6 and keep the other Party informed of all
material developments relating to any such Third Party Claim that it becomes
aware of, and provide copies of all material correspondence and documentation
relating thereto.

  

  

(3) Assumption of Defence. If the Indemnifying Party, after receiving a Notice
of Claim with respect to a Third Party Claim, does not elect to defend such
Third Party Claim within sixty (60) days (or such lesser period as may be
required by Applicable Law to respond to the Notice of Claim) after receipt of
such written notice or if the Indemnifying Party fails to conduct such defense
in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend such Third
Party Claim (upon providing further written notice to the Indemnifying Party),
subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to (i) assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim at any time prior to the settlement, compromise or
final determination thereof, and (ii) approve the

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  

 

- 76 -

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

counsel selected by the Indemnified Party (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnified Party shall
not settle, compromise or discharge or enter any judgment, or admit any
liability with respect to any such Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Article 6, no Indemnifying Party shall have any liability
under this Article 6 for any Losses arising out of or in connection with any
Third Party Claim that is settled or compromised by an Indemnified Party
without the prior written consent of such Indemnifying Party.

  

  

6.9 Insurance and Other Recoveries. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, Losses of an Indemnified Party shall be net of any
insurance or other prior or subsequent recoveries by such Indemnified Party in
connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification
(including under or pursuant to any insurance policy, indemnity, reimbursement
agreement or contract pursuant to which or under which such Indemnified Party
is a party or has rights). The applicable Indemnified Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to recover from insurance policies or other
applicable sources of recovery the maximum portion of any Losses of such
Indemnified Party. If the applicable Indemnified Party has used commercially
reasonable efforts to recover any amounts recoverable under insurance policies
or other applicable sources of recovery and has not recovered the applicable
Losses, the applicable Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the amount by
which such Losses exceeds the amounts actually recovered subject to the
limitations on indemnification set out in this Article 6. If the applicable
Indemnified Party fails to use commercially reasonable efforts to recover any
amounts recoverable under insurance policies or other applicable sources of
recovery, the applicable Indemnifying Party shall not be required to indemnify
the applicable Indemnified Party for that portion of any Losses that could
reasonably be expected to have been recovered had the applicable Indemnified
Party used such commercially reasonable efforts.

  

  

6.10 Remedies Exclusive.

  

  

(1) Exclusive Remedies. Subject to Section 6.10(2) of this Agreement and
section 6.10(2) of the Business Transfer Agreement, the remedies provided in
this Article 6 and Section 7.1 (Tax Indemnity) and in article 6 and section
11.2 of the Business Transfer Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies of the Indemnified Party from and after the Closing in connection
with any breach of a representation or warranty, or non-performance, partial
or total, of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or the
Business Transfer Agreement, provided that this Section 6.10(1) shall not
limit the remedies available to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 11.1 against
the Parent with respect to the Parent's obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

(2) Exception. Subject to Seller's rights pursuant to Section 8.6 (Exclusive
Dealings), Section 6.10(1) and Section 6.5 (Time Limits for Delivery of Notice
of Claim) shall not apply in the event that a Party fails to complete the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be completed on Closing
notwithstanding that the conditions of Closing in favour of such Party have
been satisfied in accordance with Section 5.1 (Purchaser's Conditions), in the
case of the Purchaser or, in accordance with Section 5.3 (Seller's
Conditions), in the case of the Seller.

  

  

6.11 Mitigation. An Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable efforts to
mitigate any claim or liability that any such Indemnified Party asserts or is
reasonably likely to assert under this Article 6 or Article 7. In the event
that any Indemnified Party fails to make such reasonable

  

  

  

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  

 

- 77 -

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

efforts to mitigate any such claim or liability, then notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not
be required to indemnify the Indemnified Party for that portion of any Losses
that could reasonably be expected to have been avoided if the Indemnified
Party had made such efforts.

  

  

6.12 Calculation of Losses. For the purpose only of calculating the amount of
Losses under this Article 6 or Article 7, the representations and warranties
of the Parties contained in this Agreement (other than the representations and
warranties in Section 3.1(36) (No Material Adverse Effect)) shall be deemed to
have been made without qualifications as to materiality where the words or
phrases "material", "in all material respects", "Material Adverse Effect" or
words or phrases of similar import are used, such that the amount of Losses
payable to an Indemnified Party is not subject to any deduction in respect of
amounts below the agreed upon level of materiality.

  

  

6.13 Provisions. No Indemnifying Party shall be liable under this Article 6 or
Article 7 in respect of any Loss to the extent the fact, matter, event or
circumstance giving rise to the claim or on which it is based is allowed,
provided, accrued or reserved for in the SCDA Financial Statements, the
Standard Life Bermuda Financial Statements or the Non-Insurance Company
Financial Statements or is provided for or otherwise taken into account in
determining any adjustment to the Purchase Price provided herein, including in
determining the Closing Date Adjustment and any Tax Litigation Adjustment
Amount.

  

  

6.14 Contingent Liabilities. No Indemnifying Party shall be liable under this
Article 6 or Article 7 in respect of any Loss which is contingent unless and
until such contingent Loss becomes an actual liability and is due and payable.
For greater certainty, this Section 6.14 shall not limit an Indemnified
Party's right to assert a claim within the time periods set out in Sections
6.5 (Time Limits for Delivery of Notice of Claim) or 7.3 (Survival) by notice
to the Indemnifying Party or its right to commence a Legal Proceeding within
the time period contemplated in Section 6.7(2) (Direct Claim Time Limits).

  

  

6.15 Double Claims. No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover from any
Indemnifying Party under this Article 6 or Article 7 or under any Transaction
Agreement more than once in respect of the same Loss (notwithstanding that
such Loss may result from breaches of multiple provisions of this Agreement or
a Transaction Agreement).

  

  

6.16 Net Financial Benefit. No Indemnifying Party shall be liable under this
Article 6 in respect of any Losses suffered by any Indemnified Party to the
extent there are any offsetting savings by or net financial benefits to such
Indemnified Party arising from such Losses or the facts, matters, events or
circumstances giving rise to such Losses, including any resulting deductions
or credits available to reduce the Taxes payable by a Transferred Entity for a
taxation year or period ending after Closing that would not have been
available had such Losses not been sustained.

  

  

6.17 Characterization of Indemnification Payments. Unless otherwise required
by Law, any payment made pursuant to this Article 6 or Article 7, other than
any payment of indemnification contemplated in Section 7.1(ii) or Section
7.1(iii), shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

  

  

  

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  

 

- 78 -

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

6.18 Agency. The Seller hereby accepts each indemnity in favour of the Parent
as agent and trustee of the Parent. The Seller may enforce an indemnity in
favour of the Parent on behalf of the Parent.

  

  

6.19 SLAL. The Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that it shall not
pursue any remedies against SLAL in respect of the transactions contemplated
by, and that are the subject matter of, this Agreement.

ARTICLE 7

  

TAX MATTERS

  

  

7.1 Tax Indemnity. Subject to the applicable limitations set out in Article 6,
the Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser from and against
any Losses (which, for purposes only of Sections 7.1, 7.8 (Amendments to Tax
Returns) and 7.11 (Net Financial Benefit) shall mean Taxes, and for the
purposes of Section 6.9 (Insurance and Other Recoveries), 6.11 (Mitigation)
and any reference in Article 6 to Losses indemnified, claimed, recovered or
for which the Seller is or may be liable under this Section 7.1, shall include
any Taxes) (i) payable by any Transferred Entity (a) for a Pre-Cut-off Tax
Period, (b) for an Interim Tax Period or (c) for the portion of a Straddle
Period ending immediately before the Effective Time, but in the case of
Sections 7.1(i)(b) or 7.1(i)(c), to the extent only of Taxes payable by the
Transferred Entity that are attributable to a transaction or event or
transactions or events out of the Ordinary Course of Business of the
particular Transferred Entity which occurred prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
arising as a consequence of any breach of, or inaccuracy in, the Surviving Tax
Representations (provided that the Purchaser has complied with its obligations
under Section 2.11 (Canadian Tax Matters)), or (iii) arising out and in
respect of the Pre-Closing Reorganization or as contemplated in Section 7.12,
in each case, except to the extent such Taxes arose as a result of any change
in Applicable Law or in the administration or enforcement thereof by any
relevant Tax Authority that was first announced or proposed on or after the
date hereof (or, in the case of Section 7.1(ii) or (iii), the Closing Date).

  

  

7.2 Straddle Period Taxes. For purposes of Sections 7.1(i)(c) and 7.7 (Tax
Refunds),

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |  

the amount of any Taxes, or refunds or credits of Taxes, based upon or
measured by net income or gain, activities, events, transfers, purchases,
sales or supplies for the portion of a Straddle Period ending immediately
before the Effective Time will be determined based on an interim closing of
the books as of the Effective Time, provided, however, that exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis will be
apportioned between the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date and the remainder of such Straddle Period on a daily basis (treating the
Closing Date as part of the pre-Closing period); and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |  

the amount of any other Taxes of the Transferred Entities for the portion of a
Straddle Period ending immediately before the Effective Time will be deemed to
be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period
that end on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total number
of days in such Straddle Period.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

7.3 Survival. The Purchaser's right to commence any claim for indemnification
for Taxes under Section 7.1 (Tax Indemnity) shall survive Closing and continue
until thirty (30) days after the expiry of the limitation period during which
a Tax Authority may assess such Taxes against the Purchaser or a Transferred
Entity, as the case may be for the relevant fiscal period (on the assumption
that no waiver of such limitation period is provided); provided however that
if written notice of any bona fide claim for indemnification under this
Article 7 shall have been

  

  

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  

 

- 80 -

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

delivered to the Seller within such survival period, the rights and
obligations that are the subject of such a claim shall survive until such time
as such claim is finally resolved.

  

  

7.4 Sole Remedy. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (a)
the Purchaser's sole indemnification rights with respect to Taxes are set out
in this Article 7, and no claim may be made against the Seller by the
Purchaser or any other Person for indemnification for Taxes under any other
provision of this Agreement, and (b) under no circumstances may the Purchaser
claim any amount under this Agreement solely as a result of a change in a Tax
attribute and provided that nothing in this Section 7.4 shall affect the
Purchaser's rights to any adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated in
Section 2.2 or the Purchaser's right to make a claim in respect of Section
3.1(9)(j). For the avoidance of doubt, (x) no claim may be made by the
Purchaser for any Tax that is in respect of a taxation year or period ending
after the Cut-off Date, except for claims made pursuant to Section 7.1(i)(b)
or 7.1(i)(c) in respect of Taxes for an Interim Tax Period or for the portion
of any Straddle Period ending immediately before the Effective Time, or
pursuant to Section 7.1(ii) or Section 7.1(iii), in each case subject to the
applicable limitations provided in Section 7.1 (Tax Indemnity), and (y)
without limiting the generality of Section 7.4(x), the Seller shall not be
required to indemnify the Purchaser for any Tax arising out of or in
connection with any transactions or agreements which any Transferred Entity
may enter into (including without limitation, any assumption reinsurance
agreement SCDA may enter into with the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates)
after the Effective Time.

  

  

7.5 Preparation of Tax Returns.

  

  

(1) Interim Period Tax Returns. Interim Tax Returns to be filed for the
Transferred Entities shall be prepared in draft form and in accordance with
past practice and Applicable Law by the applicable Transferred Entity and such
draft Interim Tax Returns shall be forwarded to the Purchaser for review no
later than sixty (60) days prior to the due date for such Interim Tax Returns
(or within seven (7) days after the date hereof if such due date is within
sixty-seven (67) days after the date hereof). The Purchaser shall have a
period of thirty (30) days after receipt of such draft Interim Tax Returns to
review them, and to provide comments in writing to the Seller regarding such
draft Interim Tax Returns specifying therein the reasons for any changes,
whereupon:

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |  

the Seller may but, at the Seller's sole discretion, need not file the Interim
Tax Returns on a basis that reflects such changes, to the extent such changes
pertain to the Tax consequences of any transaction or event or transactions or
events out of the Ordinary Course of Business of the applicable Transferred
Entity; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |  

the Seller shall file the Interim Tax Returns on a basis that reflects such
changes, to the extent the changes do not pertain to the Tax consequences of
any transaction or event or transactions or events out of the Ordinary Course
of Business of the applicable Transferred Entity; provided, however, that if
the Seller believes any of the required changes are not permitted under
Applicable Law, the Seller shall notify the Purchaser in writing no later than
ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the Purchaser's comments specifying
the reasons for such belief. The Parties shall then make reasonable efforts
forthwith to resolve any disagreements concerning the Purchaser's changes,
failing which the

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  

 

- 81 -

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

 

  

    

  |  

  |  

provisions of Section 2.9(3) (Tax Dispute Resolution) shall apply mutatis
mutandis to the resolution of any such dispute.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

 

  

The Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate to effect such filings on a
timely basis. The Seller shall cause the Transferred Entities to timely remit
any Taxes shown as owing on such Interim Tax Returns.

  

  

(2) Stub Period Returns. Stub Period Returns to be filed for the Transferred
Entities shall be prepared in draft form and in accordance with past practice
and Applicable Law by the applicable Transferred Entity and such draft Tax
Returns shall be forwarded to the Seller for review no later than sixty (60)
days prior to the due date for such Stub Period Returns. The Seller shall have
a period of thirty (30) days after receipt of such draft Stub Period Returns
to review them, and to provide comments in writing to the Purchaser regarding
such draft Stub Period Returns specifying therein the reasons for any changes,
whereupon:

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |  

the Purchaser may but, at the Purchaser's sole discretion, need not file the
Stub Period Returns on a basis that reflects such changes, to the extent such
changes do not pertain to the Tax consequences of any transaction or event or
transactions or events out of the Ordinary Course of Business of the
applicable Transferred Entity; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |  

the Purchaser shall file the Stub Period Returns on a basis that reflects such
changes, to the extent the changes pertain to the Tax consequences of any
transaction or event or transactions or events out of the Ordinary Course of
Business of the applicable Transferred Entity; provided, however, that if the
Purchaser believes any of the required changes are not permitted under
Applicable Law, the Purchaser shall notify the Seller in writing no later than
ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the Seller's comments specifying the
reasons for such belief. The Parties shall then make reasonable efforts
forthwith to resolve any disagreements concerning the Seller's changes,
failing which the provisions of Section 2.9(3) (Tax Dispute Resolution) shall
apply mutatis mutandis to the resolution of any such dispute.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

The Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate to effect such filings on a
timely basis. The Purchaser shall cause the Transferred Entities to timely
remit any Taxes shown as owing on such Stub Period Returns. Forthwith after
the determination by Purchaser of the amount of Taxes payable by any
Transferred Entity in respect of the taxation year ending immediately before
the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall provide the Seller with a copy of the
calculation of such Taxes. The Purchaser may cause the Transferred Entities to
make the election referred to in subsection 256(9) of the ITA and comparable
provisions of applicable provincial or territorial legislation and to file
such election(s) for the taxation years of the Transferred Entities ending
immediately before the Effective Time.

  

  

(3) Limitation. The provisions of this Section 7.5 shall apply only to Tax
Returns relating to Taxes imposed under the ITA and to GST/HST, QST and to any
equivalent Taxes imposed under analogous provincial legislation.

7.6 Cooperation. The Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate fully with each
other (and following Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Transferred
Entities to cooperate fully with the Seller) and shall make available to each
other in a timely fashion such data and other information as may reasonably be
required for the preparation, review and filing of all Stub Period Returns and
in order to contest any Tax Contest or to pursue any refund, objection or
appeal, and shall preserve such data and other information until the expiry of
any applicable limitation period under Applicable Law with respect to the
periods covered by such Stub Period Returns; provided that, for the avoidance
of doubt, neither the Seller nor any Affiliate of the Seller shall have any
obligation to provide or make available to any Person all or any portion of
any Tax Return of the Seller or of any Affiliate of the Seller other than the
Transferred Entities.

  

  

7.7 Tax Refunds. Except as set forth in the third sentence of this Section
7.7, any refunds or credits of Taxes (including throughout this Section 7.7,
any interest paid or credited with respect thereto net of any Taxes paid by
the Transferred Entities on such interest) not reflected in the SCDA Financial
Statements, Standard Life Bermuda Financial Statements or the Non-Insurance
Company Financial Statements of, or with respect to, a particular Transferred
Entity for (i) any Pre-Cut-off Tax Period, and (ii) any Interim Tax Period
but, in the case of (ii), to the extent only of a refund or credit
attributable to a transaction or event or transactions or events out of the
Ordinary Course of Business of the particular Transferred Entity will be for
the account of the Seller. The Purchaser shall promptly inform the Seller of
any such refunds or credits to which the Seller may be entitled hereunder and
shall pay to the Seller an amount equal to the amount of any such refunds or
credits within ten (10) Business Days following the date such refunds or
credits were paid or credited by the relevant Tax Authority to a Transferred
Entity. However, a refund of Taxes with respect to a Pre-Cut-off Tax Period or
Interim Tax Period will be for the account of the Purchaser or its relevant
Affiliate, and if refunded to the Seller or its Affiliates shall be paid to
the Purchaser or its relevant Affiliate as soon as reasonably practicable
after receipt, if and to the extent that such refund is attributable to a
carryback of a non-capital loss from a Post-Closing Period or to a non-capital
loss from a Straddle Period that is attributable to the post-Closing portion
of the Straddle Period. The Seller shall remain liable for its indemnity
obligations pursuant to Section 7.1 (Tax Indemnity) if the amount of any such
refund or credit is later challenged by a Tax Authority. Any payment made
pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall constitute an increase to the Purchase
Price.

  

  

7.8 Amendments to Tax Returns. Except as required by Applicable Law, neither
the Purchaser nor any Transferred Entity shall, or shall cause or permit their
Affiliates to, without prior written consent of the Seller, refile, amend or
otherwise modify any Tax Return of any Transferred Entity filed for, or do
anything else that affects Taxes with respect to (i) a Pre-Cut-off Tax Period,
or (ii) any Interim Tax Period or Straddle Period (other than carrying out
actions in the Ordinary Course of Business during a Straddle Period);
provided, however, that Seller's consent shall not be required in the case of
a refiling or amendment of a Tax Return for any such periods the sole purpose
of which refiling or amendment is to carry back a non-capital loss from a
Post-Closing Period to such earlier period. The Seller shall not be required
to indemnify the Purchaser for any Losses to the extent such Losses relate or
are attributable to any refiling, amendment, modification or other action
referred to in the previous sentence; provided, however, for greater
certainty, that a Loss shall not be considered to be "attributable" to such a
refiling, amendment, modification or other action if and to the extent that
the Loss would be indemnifiable in accordance with the terms of, and subject
to the limitations set out or referred to in, Section 7.1 had there been no
such refiling, amendment, modification or other action but, as a

  

  

  

 

  

 

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  

 

- 83 -

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

part, corollary or consequence of the Tax reporting associated with the Loss,
such a refiling, amendment, modification or other action is required by
Applicable Law or by a Tax Authority.

  

  

7.9 Tax Contests. If the Purchaser receives a notice of assessment or
reassessment, a written proposal for an assessment or reassessment, a notice
of confirmation of an assessment or reassessment, or a similar document (a
"Tax Notice") from any Tax Authority for any Taxes in respect of which a claim
may be made for indemnification under this Agreement, the Purchaser shall
promptly (but in any event within ten (10) Business Days of receipt) deliver a
copy of the Tax Notice to the Seller, together with all correspondence and any
other documents received by the Purchaser with respect to such Tax Notice. The
Purchaser and the Seller agree to cooperate and to cause their Affiliates to
cooperate with each other to the extent reasonably required after the Closing
Date in connection with any submissions in respect of such Tax Notice and any
objection or appeal in respect of such Tax Notice (each a "Tax Contest"). If
the Seller's Tax liability or the Seller's right to a Tax refund could be
affected by the Tax Contest or if the Seller could have an indemnification
obligation under this Agreement in respect of the Tax Contest, the Seller
shall have the right to conduct, control, defend, settle or compromise the
defence of the Tax Contest at its own expense, whether the Tax Contest began
before or after the Closing, provided the Seller acknowledges its obligation
to indemnify the Purchaser in respect of that Tax Contest in accordance with
the terms of, and subject to the limitations set out or referred to in,
Section 7.1. The Seller shall have the right to determine whether or not the
Transferred Entities shall agree to any settlement or compromise of a Tax
Contest, provided that (a) where such settlement or compromise would, in and
of itself, have the effect of increasing the Tax payable by any Transferred
Entity for any period beginning on or after the Cut-off Date, such settlement
or compromise shall require the written consent of the Purchaser, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and provided that (b)
notwithstanding Section 7.9(a), the Seller shall be entitled, without the
Purchaser's consent, to cause any relevant Transferred Entity to claim any
deduction available to it in computing income, taxable income or Tax payable
under the ITA and similar provincial laws (other than a deduction that arises
in a period beginning on or after the Cut-off Date), or to claim any other
applicable Tax attribute, deduction or advantage (other than an attribute,
deduction or advantage that arises in a period beginning on or after the Cut-
off Date) in settling or compromising such Tax Contest. The Purchaser shall
provide the Seller with all necessary powers of attorney and other necessary
documents and assistance to allow the Seller to effectively conduct and
control such defence. In addition, in any such case, the Purchaser agrees to
cooperate (and, following Closing, to cause the Transferred Entities to
cooperate) with the Seller in connection with all aspects of the proper
prosecution of any Tax Contest (including reasonable cooperation with respect
to production and delivery of documents, examinations for discovery,
preparation of undertakings and selection and making reasonable efforts to
secure attendance of appropriate witnesses for discoveries and hearing). The
Purchaser shall also have the right to observe, at its own expense, and to be
kept informed of the conduct, negotiation, settlement or defence of any Tax
Contest the control of which has been assumed by the Seller. If the Seller
does not assume control of a Tax Contest as permitted in this Section 7.9, the
Purchaser shall be entitled to conduct, negotiate, settle or defend the Tax
Contest at its own expense (provided that no such settlement shall increase
the amount of Taxes for which the Seller may be required to indemnify the
Purchaser under Section 7.1, except for Taxes directly at issue in the Tax
Contests), and shall allow the Seller to observe, at its own expense, and
shall keep the Seller informed of, such conduct, negotiation, settlement or
defense, and such settlement or any other final determination of the Tax
Contest shall be binding upon the Seller. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, with the

  

  

  

  

 

  

 

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  

 

- 84 -

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

exception of the preceding sentence, the Seller shall not be responsible for
any Taxes to the extent attributable to any action taken by the Purchaser with
respect to any Tax Contest without the prior written consent of the Seller.
The Seller shall not be required to make any payment on account of Taxes for
which the Seller is required to indemnify the Purchaser hereunder until final
determination (from which no appeal may be instituted) of any Tax Contest in
respect of such Taxes, unless the relevant Tax Authority is entitled to take
collection action in respect of such Taxes, notwithstanding the Tax Contest
relating thereto, in which case the Seller shall pay such Taxes or the portion
thereof that are subject to immediate collection action by the relevant Tax
Authority within the time required by Applicable Law. Failure by any Party to
notify any other Party or to keep such other Party informed and involved, or
to deliver any documents as provided in this Section 7.9 shall not relieve the
Party otherwise entitled to such notice, or to be kept informed and involved,
of the indemnification obligations contained in this Agreement except to the
extent such failure results in prejudice to such other Party. This Section 7.9
shall govern the control of Tax Contests other than the Tax Litigation.

(1) Conduct of Litigation in the Interim Period. During the Interim Period:

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |  

the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts, in good faith, to pursue
the Tax Litigation, at its own expense, in the Tax Court of Canada and any

the Tax Litigation, with a view to achieving a settlement or final resolution
of the Tax Litigation on as favourable a basis as reasonably possible to SCDA;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |

into any judgment in respect thereof in its discretion until the Final
Settlement or until the Closing;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(c)

  |  

the Seller shall keep the Purchaser informed of all material developments
relating to the Tax Litigation and provide copies of all material
correspondence and documentation relating thereto, and shall consult with and
afford the Purchaser all reasonable opportunities to provide its input on all
material considerations pertaining to the conduct, settlement or other
resolution of the Tax Litigation, and shall take such input from the Purchaser
into reasonable consideration, until the Final Settlement, or until the
Closing; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(d)

  |  

the Purchaser shall have the right to monitor the Tax Litigation at its own
cost and expense.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(2) Conduct of Litigation Post-Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in Article 6 or Article 7, if the Final Settlement has not occurred
as of the Closing Date, then after the Closing Date:

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |  

the Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts, in good faith, to
pursue the Tax Litigation, at its own expense, in the Tax Court of Canada and
any other applicable court of competent jurisdiction, and through any and all
available

Tax Litigation on as favourable a basis as reasonably possible to SCDA;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

 

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |  

subject to Section 7.10(2)(a), the Purchaser shall have the right to conduct,
control, defend, settle, compromise or discharge the Tax Litigation or enter
into any judgment in respect thereof in its discretion until the Final
Settlement or until the conduct of the Tax Litigation is taken over by the
Seller in accordance with Section 7.10(3);

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(c)

  |  

the Purchaser shall keep the Seller informed of all material developments
relating to the Tax Litigation and provide copies of all material
correspondence and documentation relating thereto, and shall consult with and
afford the Seller all reasonable opportunities to provide its input on all
material considerations pertaining to the conduct, settlement or other
resolution of the Tax Litigation, and shall take such input from the Seller
into reasonable consideration, until the Final Settlement, or until the
conduct of the Tax Litigation is taken over by the Seller in accordance with
Section 7.10(3); and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(d)

  |  

the Seller shall have the right to monitor the Tax Litigation at its own cost
and expense.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(3) Assumption of Litigation. If the Purchaser notifies the Seller that it
intends to discontinue the Tax Litigation, or if the Seller determines, acting
reasonably, that the Purchaser is not using commercially reasonable efforts in
good faith to pursue the Tax Litigation as provided in Section 7.10(2)(a), the
Seller may assume control of the Tax Litigation whereupon (and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Article 6 or Article 7):

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |  

the Seller shall, at its own expense, use commercially reasonable efforts, in
good faith, to conduct, control, defend, settle, compromise or discharge the
Tax Litigation or enter into any judgment in respect thereof in its discretion
until the Final Settlement, with a view to achieving a settlement or final
resolution of the Tax Litigation on as favourable a basis as reasonably
possible to SCDA and shall consult with and afford the Purchaser all
reasonable opportunities to provide its input on all material considerations
pertaining to the conduct, settlement or other resolution of the Tax
Litigation, and shall take such input from the Purchaser into reasonable
consideration;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |  

the Seller shall keep the Purchaser informed of all material developments
relating to the Tax Litigation and provide copies of all material
correspondence and documentation relating thereto until the Final Settlement;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(c)

  |  

the Purchaser shall cooperate (and shall cause the Transferred Entities to
cooperate) with the Seller in connection with all aspects of the proper
prosecution of the Tax Litigation (including with respect to production and
delivery of documents, examinations for discovery, preparation of undertakings
and selection and making reasonable efforts to secure attendance of
appropriate witnesses for discoveries and hearings);

(d)

  |  

the Purchaser shall provide the Seller with all necessary powers of attorney
and other necessary documents and assistance to allow the Seller to
effectively conduct and control the proper prosecution of the Tax Litigation
and implement any settlement or compromise thereof, and the Purchaser shall
allow the Seller (if the Seller so decides) to retain the existing counsel
representing SCDA in connection with the Tax Litigation; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(e)

  |  

the Purchaser shall have the right to monitor the Tax Litigation proceedings
at its own cost and expense.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(4) Litigation Records. The Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Transferred
Entities and any of its and their Representatives to, preserve all documents
relevant to the Tax Litigation until otherwise notified in writing by the
Seller.

  

  

(5) Costs. Upon any Final Settlement, (a) the Purchaser shall reimburse the
Seller for one half of the reasonable out-of-pocket, Third Party costs, fees
and expenses incurred by the Seller in respect of the Tax Litigation pursuant
to Section 7.10(3), and (b) the Seller shall reimburse the Purchaser for one
half of the reasonable out-of-pocket, Third Party costs, fees and expenses (i)
incurred by the Purchaser in respect of the Tax Litigation after the Closing
Date, and (ii) incurred by any of the Transferred Entities after June 30,
2014.

  

  

7.11 Net Financial Benefit. No Indemnifying Party shall be liable under this
Article 7 in respect of any Losses suffered by any Indemnified Party to the
extent there are any offsetting savings by or net financial benefits to such
Indemnified Party arising from such Losses or the facts, matters, events or
circumstances giving rise to such Losses, including any resulting deductions
or credits available to reduce the Taxes payable by a Transferred Entity for a
taxation year or period ending after Closing that would not have been
available had such Losses not been sustained.

(1) Indemnity. Subject to Section 7.12(2), the Purchaser shall be entitled to
indemnification under Section 7.1(iii) in respect of any SLAL Deemed Dividend
Tax for which SCDA becomes liable, plus any related interest, penalties or
costs, except to the extent of the Directed Amount, and except to the extent
such liability is attributable to any failure by the Purchaser to comply with
its obligations under Section 4.3(b) or Section 4.4; and the Purchaser shall
not otherwise be entitled to indemnification under Section 7.1 in respect of
the SLAL Deemed Dividend Tax or any related interest, penalties and costs.

  

  

(2) No Recovery. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the

ARTICLE 8

  

COVENANTS

  

  

8.1 Access for Integration Planning. During the Interim Period, subject to the
requirements and restrictions of Applicable Law and any confidentiality
obligations or restrictions on access contained in any contract with a Third
Party (provided that the Seller shall have used commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the required waiver of such confidentiality obligations or
restrictions on access from the Third Party), the Seller shall give, or cause
to be given, to the Purchaser and its Representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours, on not less than two (2) Business Days' notice to the
individuals listed at Section 8.1 of the Seller Disclosure Letter (each an
"Access Coordinator"), to the Books and Records, current members of the
management team of the Target Business to the extent such members of the
management team can be made available using the reasonable endeavours of the
Seller and the real property listed at Section 8.1 of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, in each case as the Purchaser reasonably requires solely for the
purpose of enabling the Purchaser to plan and implement its strategy as of the
Closing for the Target Business. As a condition to providing information or
access, an Access Coordinator may request that the Purchaser demonstrate to
the satisfaction of such Access Coordinator, acting reasonably, that such
information or access is required for the purposes of integration planning and
the Purchaser shall promptly respond to such request.

  

  

8.2 Personal Information.

  

  

(1) Compliance with Privacy Laws. Each Party shall comply with Privacy Laws,
the United Kingdom Data Protection Act 1998 and the Target Privacy Policies,
as applicable, in the course of collecting, using and disclosing Transaction
Personal Information. The Purchaser shall collect Transaction Personal
Information prior to Closing only for purposes related to the Proposed
Transactions and, if the Parties do not elect to terminate this Agreement as
provided herein, for the completion of such transactions. During the Interim
Period, the Purchaser shall not disclose Transaction Personal Information to
any Person other than to its Representatives who are evaluating and advising
on the Proposed Transactions. The Purchaser shall not, following the Closing,
without the consent of the individuals to whom such Personal Information
relates or as permitted or required by Applicable Law, use or disclose
Transaction Personal Information for purposes other than those for which such
Transaction Personal Information was collected by the Transferred Entities
prior to the Closing.

  

  

(2) Protection of Transaction Personal Information. The Purchaser shall
protect and safeguard the Transaction Personal Information against loss or
theft, as well as unauthorized access, use, copying, modification or
disclosure to reflect the requirements under applicable Privacy Laws and the
United Kingdom Data Protection Act 1998. The Purchaser shall not disclose or
transfer any Transaction Personal Information to any Person located outside of
Canada. The Purchaser shall cause its Representatives to observe the terms of
this Section 8.2 and to protect and safeguard Transaction Personal Information
in their possession. If the Seller or the Purchaser terminates this Agreement
as provided herein, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller all Transaction
Personal Information in its possession or in the possession of any of its
Affiliates and Representatives, including all copies, reproductions, summaries
or extracts thereof in accordance with Section 8.3(4).

8.3 Confidentiality.

  

  

(1) Information To Be Confidential. Each Recipient shall treat confidentially
and not disclose, and shall inform its Representatives of the confidential
nature of such Confidential Information and shall cause each of its
Representatives to treat confidentially and not disclose, other than as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement, any Confidential Information of a
Discloser. A Recipient shall not disclose any Confidential Information of the
Discloser, any of its Affiliates or the Proposed Transactions to any
Governmental Authority except with the prior written approval of the Discloser
in accordance with Section 8.3(3) or as contemplated pursuant to Article 9. A
Recipient shall (at its own expense) take all reasonable measures, including
court proceedings, to restrain its Representatives from making any
unauthorized use or disclosure of any of the Confidential Information of a
Discloser. A Recipient shall be liable and responsible for any breach of this
provision by any of its Representatives. A Discloser may, in its sole
discretion, prior to furnishing any of its Confidential Information to a
Recipient, specify (i) that any such Confidential Information is not to be
shared by the Recipient with certain Persons and/or (ii) impose any other
additional confidentiality protocols or restrictions with respect to the
Recipient, its Affiliates and/or its Representatives accessing and using any
such Confidential Information; and, in each case, the Recipient shall
implement and comply with, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives
to implement and comply with, any such specifications or requirements of the
Discloser, as well as any Applicable Laws, in each case as a condition to
accessing any such Confidential Information.

  

  

(2) Use Of Confidential Information. A Recipient may disclose Confidential
Information only to those of its Representatives who need to know such
Confidential Information for the purpose of implementing the Proposed
Transactions. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, during the Interim
Period, the Purchaser shall not disclose Supervisory Information relating to
the Transferred Entities except to the individuals set out in Section 8.3(2)
of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter.

  

  

(3) Required Disclosure and Disclosure to Tax Authority.

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |  

A Recipient shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any
Governmental Authority (including, for purposes of this Section 8.3(3)(a)
only, any Tax Authority) except with the express prior written approval of the
Discloser or in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.3 or as
contemplated by Article 9. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, if a
Recipient or any of its Representatives receives a request from a Governmental
Authority or is legally required by Applicable Law to disclose all or any part
of the Confidential Information of a Discloser or any other information
concerning the Discloser, any of its Affiliates or the Proposed Transactions,
such Recipient shall (i) promptly notify the Discloser of the existence, terms
and circumstances surrounding the request or requirement, (ii) consult with
the Discloser on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist
or narrow the request or lawfully avoid the requirement, and (iii) if
requested by the Discloser, take all necessary steps to seek a protective
order or other appropriate remedy, the costs of which shall be paid or
reimbursed by the Discloser. If a protective order or other remedy is not
available, or if the Discloser waives compliance with the provisions of this
Section 8.3(3), the Recipient receiving the request for disclosure or its

- 89 -

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

 

  

    

  |  

  |  

Representatives, as the case may be, may disclose to the Person requiring
disclosure only that portion of the Confidential Information which such
Recipient is advised by written opinion of counsel is legally required to be
disclosed and shall exercise the Recipient's reasonable best efforts to obtain
reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such portion.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

 

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |  

A Recipient shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any Tax
Authority except with the express prior written approval of the Discloser or
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if disclosure of information concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereunder is required in order to obtain a ruling,
certificate or other document from any relevant Tax Authority (a "Tax Ruling")
that the Recipient reasonably believes, based on the advice of legal counsel,
it is necessary or desirable to obtain in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereunder, such Recipient shall (i) promptly
notify the Discloser of the necessity or desirability of obtaining the Tax
Ruling, and (ii) consult with the Discloser on the possibility of otherwise
addressing the concerns that gave rise to the necessity or desirability of
obtaining the Tax Ruling. If such concerns cannot otherwise be addressed to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Recipient, or if the Discloser waives
compliance with the provisions of this Section 8.3(3)(b), the Recipient or its
Representatives may disclose to the relevant Tax Authority only that portion
of the Confidential Information which is required in order to obtain the Tax
Ruling and shall exercise the Recipient's reasonable best efforts to obtain
reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such portion.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(4) Return or Destruction. Following the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, each Recipient shall (and
shall cause each of its Representatives to) (a) return promptly to the
Discloser or destroy all physical copies of the Confidential Information of
the Discloser, excluding Notes prepared by the Recipient or its
Representatives, then in such Recipient's possession or in the possession of
its Representatives, (b) destroy all (i) electronic copies of such
Confidential Information of the Discloser or any of its Affiliates, and (ii)
all Notes (including electronic copies thereof) prepared by such Recipient or
any of its Representatives, including electronic back-ups of the foregoing in
a manner that ensures the same may not be retrieved or undeleted by such
Recipient or any of its Representatives, and (c) deliver to the Discloser,
upon written request of the Discloser, a certificate executed by one of the
Recipient's duly authorized senior officers indicating that the requirements
of this Section 8.3(4) have been satisfied in full. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Recipient and its Representatives may retain Confidential
Information to the extent (y) it is backed-up or archived, as a matter of
routine processes, on the electronic information management and communications
systems or servers of the Recipient or its Representatives and such backed up
or archived Confidential Information is not intentionally accessed and is
deleted in accordance with the Recipient's policies with respect to the
retention of electronic records, or (z) retention is required by law or
regulatory authority; provided, that to the extent any Confidential
Information is retained in accordance with this sentence, the confidentiality
obligations hereunder shall survive indefinitely in relation to such stored
Confidential Information until such time as it is permanently deleted.

(5) Privilege. Each Party acknowledges that certain Confidential Information
may be information to which solicitor-client privilege or litigation
privilege, or both, attaches. Each Party recognizes that the Discloser has a
material interest in the preservation of privilege in respect of privileged
material. No waiver of any privilege is implied by the disclosure of
Confidential Information to any person pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

  

  

(6) After Closing. With respect to any Confidential Information of the
Transferred Entities (except to the extent an Excluded Asset), from and after
the Closing the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be deemed for purposes of
this Section 8.3 to be the Discloser of such Confidential Information and the
Seller and its Affiliates shall be deemed for purposes of this Section 8.3 to
be the Recipient of such Confidential Information.

  

  

8.4 Risk of Loss. If before the Closing all or any material portion of the
properties or assets of the Target Business, taken as a whole, is lost,
damaged or destroyed or is expropriated or seized by any Governmental
Authority or any other Person in accordance with Applicable Law or if notice
of any such expropriation or seizure shall have been given in accordance with
Applicable Law, the Purchaser shall nonetheless complete the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement and the Seller will, subject to and as of the
Closing, surrender to the Purchaser (a) any insurance proceeds received by the
Seller under any insurance policy with respect to such damage, destruction or
loss, less any proceeds applied to the physical restoration of such asset
prior to the Closing, (b) any proceeds of such expropriation or seizure, and
(c) all rights of the Seller with respect to any causes of action, whether or
not litigation has commenced as of the Closing, in connection with such
damage, destruction, loss, expropriation or seizure. The Seller will make
available to the Purchaser the benefits of any insurance policy covering such
assets and properties with respect to insured events or occurrences prior to
the Closing (whether or not claims relating to such events or occurrences are
made prior to or after the Closing); provided, however, that the benefits of
such insurance will be subject to (and recovery thereon will be reduced by the
amount of) any applicable deductibles and co-payment provisions or any payment
or reimbursement obligations of the Seller in respect thereof.

  |  

(ii)

- 98 -

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

    

  |  

(v)

  |  

the Purchaser does not, before 5.00 p.m. (Toronto time) on the tenth (10th)
Business Day after receipt of the notice described in Section 8.6(5)(a)(iv),
notify the Seller in writing that it will improve the terms of this Agreement
and the Transaction Documents, or the board of directors of the Parent shall
have determined, in good faith, after consultation with financial advisors and
outside counsel, that the Alternative Proposal is a Superior Proposal compared
to the proposed amendment to the terms of the transactions notified to the
Seller by the Purchaser prior to such time (the "Revised Offer"); and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(vi)

  |  

the Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(c) within one
Business Day of accepting, approving, recommending or entering into any such
agreement.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |  

The board of directors of the Parent will review any Revised Offer in order to
determine, in good faith and in accordance with their fiduciary and statutory
duties, whether such Revised Offer would result in the Alternative Proposal
not being a Superior Proposal compared to the Revised Offer. If the board of
directors of the Parent determine that the Revised Offer would result in the
Alternative Proposal not being a Superior Proposal compared to the Revised
Offer, the Parties shall as soon as reasonably practicable enter into
appropriate amendments to this Agreement and, if necessary, any other
Transaction Agreement, to give effect to such terms.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(6) New Alternative Proposals. The Parent and the Seller each acknowledge and
agree that each successive modification of any Alternative Proposal shall
constitute a new Alternative Proposal for the purposes of this Section 8.6.

  

  

(7) Responsible for Affiliates and Representatives. The Parent and the Seller
shall ensure that their Affiliates and their respective Representatives comply
with the provisions of this Section, and Parent and the Seller shall be

Purchaser (or relevant parts thereof) (other than such books and records

Purchaser relating to the Purchaser's investment in the Target Business), for
a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date or for such longer period of

- 99 -

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

year-end financial reports and statements) in respect of the financial years
ending December 31, 2014, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016, (iv) Tax

provide the Seller and its Representatives with such reasonable assistance as
the Seller and its Representatives may require in connection with such access.

  

  

(2) Access to Seller's Records. The Seller shall maintain or cause to be
maintained, and Purchaser and its Affiliates and Representatives shall, to the
extent reasonably required by the Purchaser, have reasonable access to any
books and records of the Seller and its Affiliates (or relevant parts thereof)

records relating to the Proposed Transactions or confidential information of
the Seller relating to Seller's investment in the Target Business), for a

(3) Retention Rights. The Purchaser acknowledges that the Seller and/or its
Affiliates shall be entitled to retain copies of any of the Books and Records,
in its discretion, acting reasonably, for accounting, tax, litigation and
regulatory purposes and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Seller shall be also entitled to retain (i) copies (electronic or otherwise)
of the materials posted to the Virtual Data Room or otherwise provided or made
available by the Seller to the Purchaser in connection with the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, including the purchase and sale of the Target
Shares, (ii) all internal correspondence and memoranda, valuations, regulatory
filings and returns, investment banking presentations and offers received from
others in connection with the sale of the Target Shares, and (iii) a copy of
all financial information and all other accounting records prepared or used in
connection with the preparation of the financial statements of any Transferred

Target Business or the Transferred Entities, retained by the Seller and/or its
Affiliates shall be subject to confidentiality and use obligations in favour
of the Purchaser equivalent to those provided in Section 8.3 mutatis mutandis.

  

  

(4) Financial Reporting. The Purchaser agrees that it shall, or shall procure,
in a timely manner and upon reasonable notice the preparation of all financial
information relating to the Transferred Entities that is required for the
purpose of reporting by the Parent and its Affiliates in respect of the period
from January 1, 2012 up to Closing.

  

  

8.8 Excluded Intellectual Property.

  

  

(1) Trade-marks. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that except pursuant to
the Transitional Trade-mark License, the Purchaser is not acquiring any rights
in and to the Excluded Intellectual Property and, following the Closing Date,
the Purchaser shall not have any right, title or interest in or to, or right
to use, (i) any Excluded Intellectual Property, or (ii) any trade-marks
confusingly similar thereto. Except as specifically provided for in the
Transitional Trade-mark License, the Purchaser covenants that it will not
hereafter adopt, use, or register or authorize any other Person to adopt, use,
or register (x) any trade-marks consisting of or

  

  

  

  

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  

 

- 100 -

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

incorporating any Excluded Intellectual Property, or (y) any trade-marks
confusingly similar thereto. In the event that after the Closing Date, and
except as otherwise provided in the Transitional Trade-mark License, it
becomes apparent that any asset consisting of or incorporating any Excluded
Intellectual Property and any asset consisting of software, data, other
technology and materials relating thereto not addressed in any of the
Transaction Agreements and any intellectual property rights subsisting therein
that are required for the business of the Seller or its Affiliates after the
Closing Date has been transferred to the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall,
without payment of any consideration, either transfer such asset back to the
Seller (and execute and file with all relevant Governmental Authorities
documentation in connection with such transfer as the Seller reasonably
requests or which may be required by Applicable Law) or, if such transfer
would be disruptive or unduly costly, take other appropriate measures as the
Parties agree.

  

  

(2) Existing Licenses. Any license between a Transferred Entity and the Seller
or any of its Affiliates (other than a Transferred Entity) providing for the
use by a Transferred Entity of any trade-marks owned by the Seller or any of
such Affiliates shall be terminated as of the Closing Date.

  

  

(3) Names. Except as otherwise provided in the Transitional Trade-mark License
or as required by any Governmental Authority, but subject to the receipt of
all required Regulatory Approvals and Consents which the Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, no later than seven (7) days
following the Closing, the Purchaser shall have completed such steps, and
obtained such approvals, as are required to change the name of each
Transferred Entity, each Standard Life Fund, Standard Life Corporate Class and
Standard Life Foundation such that the names of the Transferred Entities, the
Standard Life Funds, Standard Life Corporate Class and Standard Life
Foundation do not include any Excluded Intellectual Property.

  

  

8.9 Change of Control of Manager. The Purchaser shall promptly advise the
Seller of any plans that it may adopt prior to the Closing pursuant to which
the acquisition of control by it of the securities of SLMF could reasonably be
expected to be considered by one or more Securities Authorities as a change of
manager of any Standard Life Mutual Fund rather than a change of control of
manager, including by reason of the considerations described in OSC Staff
Notice 81-710, and thereby trigger a requirement for SLMF to call, prior to
the Closing, any Standard Life Mutual Fund Meeting to obtain approval of the
Proposed Transactions.

  

  

8.10 Third Party Consents. The Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate, using
commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain all material Consents agreed to by
the Parties as reasonably necessary and appropriate to effect the Proposed
Transactions.

  

  

8.11 Agreements with Affiliates; Guarantees.

  

  

(1) Agreements with Affiliates. Except for those agreements listed in Section
8.11 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, unless otherwise agreed in writing by
the Seller and the Purchaser, the Transferred Entities on one hand and the
Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities) on the other
hand shall:

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |  

terminate all agreements between a Transferred Entity and a Seller or an
Affiliate of the Seller (other than the other Transferred Entities) prior to
or on Closing; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

  

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  

 

- 101 -

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |  

within sixty (60) days after Closing, settle all amounts outstanding under all
agreements listed in Section 3.1(31) of the Seller Disclosure Letter (other
than the Employee Plans listed at Section 8.11(1) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter) together with the amounts referred to on Section 8.11(1) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter as to be accrued as of the Closing Date in respect of the
Employee Plans listed at Section 8.11(1) of the Seller Disclosure Letter;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

in each case (i) without penalty, cancellation or termination fee or any other
similar increases and (ii) releasing any related obligations. For greater
certainty, this Section 8.11 shall not apply to any of the Transaction
Agreements.

  

  

(2) Guarantees. At or prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall (a) arrange
for substitute guarantees, letters of credit, and other obligations or
commitments to replace (i) any guarantees, letters of credit, surety bonds,
performance bonds, capital maintenance agreements or commitments, and other
similar contractual obligations or commitments entered into with a Third Party
by or on behalf of the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than solely by
any of the Transferred Entities) in connection with the Target Business
(together, the "Seller Guarantees") and outstanding as of the date hereof and
(ii) any Seller Guarantees entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business, on
or after the date hereof and prior to the Closing to the extent that the
Seller has notified the Purchaser of the details of such Seller Guarantees at
least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing, or (b) assume all obligations
under each Seller Guarantee, obtaining from the creditor or other counterparty
a full release (in a form satisfactory to the Seller, acting reasonably) of
all parties liable, directly or indirectly, for reimbursement to the creditor
or fulfillment of other obligations to a counterparty in connection with
amounts drawn under the Seller Guarantees. The Purchaser further agrees that
to the extent (c) the beneficiary or counterparty under any Seller Guarantee
does not accept any such substitute guarantee, letter of credit, or other
obligation or commitment proffered by the Purchaser, or (d) the Purchaser is
unable to obtain from the beneficiary or counterparty to any Seller Guarantee
a full release (in a form satisfactory to the Seller, acting reasonably) as
contemplated by Section 8.11(2)(b), the Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Seller and its Affiliates against, and reimburse the Seller
and its Affiliates for, any and all amounts paid, including costs or expenses
in connection with such Seller Guarantees, including the expenses of the
Seller and its Affiliates in maintaining such Seller Guarantees, whether or
not any such Seller Guarantee is drawn upon or required to be performed, and
shall in any event promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days)
reimburse the Seller and its Affiliates to the extent any Seller Guarantee is
called upon and the Seller or its Affiliates make any payment or are obligated
to reimburse the party issuing the Seller Guarantee.

  

  

8.12 Director and Officer Liabilities. From and after the Closing Date, the
Purchaser agrees that it shall not, and shall cause the Transferred Entities
not to, take any steps that would be expected to affect adversely the rights
of any individual who served as a director or officer of a Transferred Entity
at any time prior to the Closing Date (each, a "DandO Indemnified Person") to be
indemnified, either pursuant to Applicable Law or the organizational documents
of the Transferred Entities as they existed prior to the Closing Date, against
any costs or expenses (including legal fees and expenses of investigation,
defense and ongoing monitoring), judgments, penalties, fines, losses, charges,
demands, actions, suits, proceedings, settlements, assessments, deficiencies,
Taxes, interest, obligations, damages, liabilities or amounts paid in
settlement incurred in connection with any Legal Proceeding arising out of or
pertaining to matters existing

  

  

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  

 

- 102 -

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date and relating to the fact that the
DandO Indemnified Person was a director or officer of a Transferred Entity,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing Date.

  

  

8.13 Excluded Assets. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8.5,
during the Interim Period or following the Closing Date the Seller shall not
be restricted from removing any of the Excluded Assets from any Transferred
Entity, including transferring any of the Excluded Intellectual Property to
the Seller or any of its Affiliates.

  

  

8.14 Schedules to the Transaction Agreements and Other Agreements. Promptly
following the date hereof, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts and co-operate to finalize the amended Intra-Company Reinsurance
Agreements contemplated in Section 4.2(m) and the amended New Branch Services
Agreement contemplated in Section 4.2(n) and complete those Schedules to the
Transaction Agreements that have been identified in such agreements as
requiring completion on terms acceptable to the Parties, acting reasonably and
in good faith.

  

  

8.15 Segmented Policies. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees it shall, with
respect to the Segmented Policies, satisfy the requirements as set out in the
Segmented Policies Requirements and provide such commitment with respect to
the Segmented Policies as is required by OSFI in connection with the Proposed
Transactions.

  

  

8.16 Options and Other Stock Related Benefits. It is agreed by the Parties
that, the vesting of the relevant Employees awards and entitlements under the
stock-based or stock-related Employee Plans will be governed by the applicable
plan rules. The Parties shall administer the income tax, social security
contributions and other applicable deductions and withholdings with respect to
those Employee Plans listed in Section 8.16 in accordance with the terms set
out in Section 8.16 of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

  

  

8.17 Standard Life Corporate Class Trust. Following Closing, at the
Purchaser's request, the Parties shall in good faith cooperate to effect the
appointment of the nominees of the Purchaser as trustees of the Standard Life
Corporate Class Trust.

  

  

8.18 Excluded Assets. The Seller shall notify the Purchaser in writing within
sixty (60) days of the date hereof of any property, rights and assets used in
the operation of the Target Business as of the date hereof that are not listed
in Section 3.1(28) of the Seller Disclosure Letter. If the Seller identifies
any such property (which the Parties currently anticipate would likely only be
software used by the Target Businesses under a global licence which will not
apply to the Target Businesses after the Closing Date), the Parties will work
together in good faith to find an equitable solution, which may include
providing transitional services using such property, utilizing, at the
Purchaser's expense, a global licence held by the Seller or its Affiliates
(other than Transferred Entities) and sharing any additional expenses required
to obtain use of such property for a reasonable period. The Seller shall
provide such information to the Purchaser as the Purchaser may reasonably
request to consider the property, rights and assets included in Seller's
notice.

8.19 [Redacted] Platform. The Purchaser acknowledges that, as of the date of
this Agreement, SLI Canada's business uses a platform for compliance,
portfolio modeling and trade order management provided by [Redacted] (the
"[Redacted] Platform"). The Seller shall cause one of its Affiliates to
support and work with the Purchaser to develop an appropriate arrangement, at
the Purchaser's cost, to ensure that the Purchaser will have access to an
environment sufficient to operate SLI Canada's business in a manner similar in
all material respects to the manner in which it was operated immediately prior
to the date hereof, currently contemplated to be in accordance with the SLI
Exit Blueprint set out in Section 8.19 of the Seller Disclosure Letter. For
greater certainty, at the Purchaser's request, the Seller shall, prior to
Closing, reposition the [Redacted] Platform to a hosted environment in SLI
Canada and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to the
Purchaser, as at the Closing and at the Purchaser's cost, a separate instance
of the [Redacted] Platform related to SLI Canada's business.

  

  

8.20 Software. The Purchaser acknowledges that, as of the date of this
Agreement, the Target Business may utilize software, other than the [Redacted]
Platform, that is licensed under a global or other form of shared license
("Shared Software"). To the extent that the Target Business reasonably
requires such Shared Software in order to continue to operate following the
Closing in a manner similar in all material respects to the manner in which it
was operated immediately prior to the date hereof, the Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, at the Purchaser's expense, and work
cooperatively with the Purchaser to seek to enable the Target Business to
continue to use such Shared Software. The Parties will work together in good
faith to determine the best manner to structure any arrangement relating to
Shared Software with a view to minimizing costs, including splitting existing
licenses, acquiring separate instances of software, or such other approach as
the Parties consider appropriate.

  

  

8.21 Transitional Requirements. Without limiting other provisions of this
Agreement, to the extent that it is determined prior to or within sixty (60)
days of Closing, that any of the Transferred Entities or the Target Business
requires access to any services that, prior to Closing, were provided by the
Parent or its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities), including any
services under group licenses of Intellectual Property held by the Parent and
its Affiliates (other than trademarks of the Parent and its Affiliates) and
services provided by Third Parties under service agreements with the Parent
and its Affiliates, which services are reasonably required by the Target
Business in order to continue to operate following the Closing in the manner
in which it had operated immediately prior to Closing, and which the Purchaser
cannot replace using commercially reasonable efforts, the Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to continue to make such services available to
the Target Business until the Purchaser is able to replace such services, but
in no circumstance later than the date that is six (6) months following the
Closing Date. The Seller shall provide such services on reasonable terms and
conditions, including price.

  

  

8.22 Financings. Between the date hereof and the Closing, the Seller shall,
and shall cause the Transferred Entities to, and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its and the Transferred Entities' Representatives
to provide to the Purchaser and its Affiliates all cooperation reasonably
requested by the Purchaser in connection with equity and/or debt financings
(the "Financings") by the Purchaser or its Affiliates in connection with the
Proposed Transactions, including an equity financing of subscription receipts
to be issued by an Affiliate of the Purchaser pursuant to a prospectus
supplement to such Affiliate's base shelf prospectus and to one or more
purchasers on a private placement basis. Such cooperation shall include, in

  

  

  

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  

 

- 104 -

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

each case: (i) participation in meetings, presentations and due diligence
sessions, (ii) providing information and assisting with the preparation of a
prospectus, prospectus supplement or other disclosure documents in connection
with the Financings, including providing a reasonable summary description of
the Target Business for use in any such disclosure documents and related
marketing materials, (iii) taking all actions reasonably necessary and
appropriate to permit the underwriters or agents in such Financings and their
counsel to complete customary pre-closing due diligence on the Target Business
as though a Transferred Entity was completing an underwritten public offering
of equity securities, and (iv) providing customary auditor consents and
comfort letters as may be reasonably requested by the underwriters or agents
in such Financings. The Seller hereby consents to the inclusion of (x)
Confidential Information in any disclosure document for the Financings to the
extent required by Applicable Law; and (y) any Excluded Intellectual Property
in any disclosure document for the Financings to the extent required to
facilitate such Financings, provided that the Purchaser shall give reasonable
consideration to the Seller's reasonable comments in respect of any such
disclosure documents where such comments are provided within a reasonable time
frame prior to the filing of any such disclosure documents.

  

  

8.23 Business Transfer Agreement. No later than September 5, 2014, the Parties
shall contact Assuris together to confirm that the proposed structure of the
transactions set forth in the draft Business Transfer Agreement and as
described in Section 8.23 of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the "Proposed BTA
Structure") will not adversely affect the Assuris coverage relating to those
stacking policy arrangements where a policyholder has a Policy with SCDA and a
policy with New Branch, each having separate Assuris coverage (the "Assuris
Coverage"). If Assuris confirms that the Proposed BTA Structure will not have
an adverse effect on the Assuris Coverage, the Purchaser will, and the Parent
will cause New Branch to, enter into the Business Transfer Agreement, subject
to completing those schedules and exhibits to the Business Transfer Agreement
that have not been completed. If Assuris advises that the Proposed BTA
Structure will have an adverse effect on the Assuris Coverage, the Parties,
acting reasonably and in good faith, will revise the Business Transfer
Agreement, with a view to minimizing any amendments to the Business Transfer
Agreement as much as possible, to provide for the assumption reinsurance by
the Purchaser of all of the policies written or assumed by New Branch that
would otherwise have been reinsured thereunder on an assumption reinsurance
basis by SCDA.

ARTICLE 9

  

REGULATORY FILINGS

  

  

9.1 Filings with Governmental Authorities.

  

  

(1) Required Regulatory Approvals. The Purchaser and the Seller shall file
with the applicable Governmental Authority such notifications, applications,
and related submissions as are required to obtain the Required Regulatory
Approvals. Within fifteen (15) Business Days of the date hereof the Purchaser
shall file a request for an advance ruling certificate with the Competition
Bureau and a request for approval of the Minister in respect of the Insurance
Companies Act Approval. Fourteen (14) Business Days after filing the request
for an advance ruling certificate, the Purchaser and the Seller shall file
their respective notifications under subsection 114(1) of the Competition Act.
With respect to the Required Regulatory Approvals and any Regulatory Approval
required in respect of the Business Transfer Agreement, the Purchaser shall
use, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to use, its commercially
reasonable endeavours to obtain such approvals as soon as is reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement including, if necessary, in
connection with the Competition Act Approval, the Purchaser making Competition
Efforts. For this purpose, "Competition Efforts" means proposing, negotiating,
agreeing to and effecting by a consent agreement any disposals, conditions,
obligations, terms, undertakings or hold separate arrangements that may be
required as a basis for the Commissioner not to challenge the Proposed
Transactions before the Competition Tribunal pursuant to Part VIII of the
Competition Act.

  

  

(2) Adjustment Relating to Competition Efforts. In the unlikely event that the
Purchaser is required to make any Competition Efforts pursuant to Section
9.1(1), the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser an amount to be agreed by the
Purchaser and the Seller based upon whether and the degree to which the
Competition Efforts are material and the costs suffered or incurred by the
Purchaser in making the Competition Efforts. To the extent that such agreed
amount can be determined prior to the Closing, such agreed amount shall be
paid at the Closing with any remaining portion of such amount being paid by
the Seller to the Purchaser after the Closing as such amount is further
determined. The maximum amount that could be paid pursuant to this Section
9.1(2) would be four-hundred million dollars ($400,000,000).

  

  

(3) Other Regulatory Approvals. The Parties shall forthwith and in any event
within fifteen (15) Business Days from the signing of this Agreement, make
such other applications to obtain all other Regulatory Approvals and in doing
so, each Party will keep the other Party informed as to the status of those
proceedings.

  

  

9.2 Information and Requests. The Seller and the Purchaser shall furnish the
other Party or the applicable Governmental Authority with such information and
assistance as the other Party or Governmental Authority may reasonably request
in order to obtain any Required Regulatory Approval and any Regulatory
Approval required under the Competition Act in respect of the Business
Transfer Agreement. For greater certainty, the Seller shall not be required to
provide any of its Tax Returns or any Tax Returns of any of its Affiliates
other than a Transferred Entity. All requests and enquiries from any
Governmental Authority shall be dealt with by the Purchaser and the Seller in
consultation with the other.

9.3 Requirements and Restrictions with respect to Regulatory Approvals. With
respect to obtaining the Required Regulatory Approvals, and any Regulatory
Approval required under the Competition Act in respect of the Business
Transfer Agreement, the Seller and the Purchaser shall:

---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |  

promptly notify the other Party of written communications of any nature from a
Governmental Authority relating to the Required Regulatory Approvals or any
Regulatory Approval required under the Competition Act in respect of the
Business Transfer Agreement and provide the other with copies thereof, except
to the extent of competitively or commercially sensitive information provided
that, in the case of the Competition Act Approval, such competitively and/or
commercially sensitive information will be provided but only to the external
legal counsel or external expert of the other and shall not be shared by such
counsel or expert with any other Person;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(c)

  |  

subject to Sections 9.3(b), 9.3(d) and 9.3(e), respond as promptly as
reasonably possible to any inquiries or requests received from a Governmental
Authority in respect of the Required Regulatory Approvals or any Regulatory
Approval required under the Competition Act in respect of the Business
Transfer Agreement;

  |  

(d)

  |  

permit the other to review in advance any proposed written communications of
any nature with a Governmental Authority in respect of the Required Regulatory
Approvals or any Regulatory Approval required under the Competition Act in
respect of the Business Transfer Agreement, and provide the other with final
copies thereof unless the timing of the response requested by the Governmental
Authority does not reasonably permit such review or except in respect of
competitively or commercially sensitive information, which competitively
and/or commercially sensitive information will be redacted from the draft
written communications to be shared with the other Party pursuant to this
Section 9.3(d) except to the extent relating to the Competition Act Approval,
in which case it will be provided (on an unredacted basis) only to the
external legal counsel or external expert of the other and shall not be shared

Required Regulatory Approvals or any Regulatory Approval required under the
Competition Act in respect of the Business Transfer Agreement unless it
consults with the other Party in advance and gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat (except (i) where the timing of
the response requested by the Governmental Authority does not reasonably

Purchaser shall not have any further claim against the Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including the Seller) arising from or in connection with this
Agreement, and the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that such payment shall

any wilful breach of Section 8.6 or 11.6.

12.6 Binding Agreement; Further Assurances. The Seller and the Purchaser shall
from time to time promptly execute and deliver or cause to be executed and
delivered, at the cost of the Party making the request, all such further
documents and instruments as are within its power and shall do or cause to be

such Party may reasonably request as being necessary to effectively carry out
or better evidence or perfect the full intent and meaning of this Agreement or
any provision hereof. The Parties acknowledge and agree that each of the
provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of the Transaction Agreements
are binding and enforceable against the Parties, including Sections 8.14,
8.18, 8.19, 8.20, 8.21 and 8.23 hereof. To that end, the Parties have provided
herein the means and standards by which any remaining details are to be
finally determined. In the event that any dispute arises as to the
determination of any such remaining details, the Parties agree that none of

Transaction Agreements is not binding, but rather will pursue such remedies as
this Agreement may contemplate or provide with a view to having the correct
determination of such details being finally adjudged.

  

  

12.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Transaction Agreements, the Common
Interest Agreement, the Seller Disclosure Letter and the Purchaser Disclosure
Letter constitute the entire agreement between the Parties pertaining to the
subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements,
understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written
pertaining to such subject matter. There are no conditions, representations,

inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of

the extent necessary to remove the conflict or inconsistency.

Agreement shall not be effective unless in writing and signed by the Party to

specific purpose for which it has been given. No waiver shall be inferred from
or implied by any failure to act or delay in acting by a Party in respect of
any default, breach or non-observance or by anything done or omitted to be
done by the other Parties. The waiver by a Party of any default, breach or
non-compliance under this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of that
Party's rights under this Agreement in respect of any continuing or subsequent
default, breach or non-observance (whether of the same or any other nature).

  

  

12.10 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or

to this Agreement shall be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction in
the Province of Ontario, and for that purpose now irrevocably and
unconditionally attorns and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
Ontario court, (ii) that it irrevocably waives any right to, and will not,
oppose any such Ontario action or proceeding on any jurisdictional basis,
including forum non conveniens, and (iii) not to oppose the enforcement
against it in any other jurisdiction of any Order duly obtained from an
Ontario court as contemplated by this Section 12.12.

  

  

12.13 Successors and Assigns; Assignment. This Agreement shall enure to the
benefit of, and be binding on, the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. None of the Parties may assign or transfer, whether
absolutely, by way of security or otherwise, all or any part of its respective
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other Parties, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  

  

12.14 Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the
Parties, and except as specifically provided for in this Agreement, nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  

  

12.15 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall

ARTICLE 2

  

GRANT OF LICENSE

  

  

2.1 Grant. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants
to Licensee a non-exclusive, personal, royalty-free, with no right to
sublicense (other than to Permitted Sublicensees), license to:

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

use the SLC Trade-marks in the SLC Territory for a period not exceeding the
SLC Term, only in connection with SLC Products and SLC Services, and in
respect of all Signage, in each case in accordance with the Standards and
otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and substantially in
the form in which the Trade-marks were used on or in connection with SLC
Products and SLC Services immediately prior to the Effective Date; and

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

use the SLI Trade-marks in the SLI Territory for a period not exceeding the
SLI Term, only in connection with SLI Products and SLI Services in each case
in accordance with the Standards and otherwise in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and substantially in the form in which the Trade-marks were
used on or in connection with SLI Products and SLI Services immediately prior
to the Effective Date.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

The license to use the Trade-marks is limited to use on or in connection with
the Products, Services, or Signage only (including any Materials that are in
the form used prior to the Effective Date or, if such Materials are designed
after the Effective Date, are approved by Licensor in writing in advance of
their use). Nothing herein shall in any way preclude or limit Licensor from
the right, either by itself or through third parties, to use, display,
promote, license or otherwise exploit the Trade-marks. Licensor reserves all
rights not expressly granted to Licensee hereunder. For greater certainty, no
other provision of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Business Transfer
Agreement or this Agreement expands, or is intended to expand, the scope of
the licenses granted to Licensee in this Section 2.1. Nothing herein grants,
or shall be deemed to grant, to Licensee any rights to use or exploit any
Excluded Intellectual Property. However, Licensee may distribute Materials
which exist as of the Effective Date which incorporate or display any Excluded
Intellectual Property during the SLI Term or the SLC Term, as the case may be,
in accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of this Agreement.

  

  

2.2 No Sublicense. Except for the Permitted Sublicensees, Licensee shall not
grant any sublicense in respect of the rights licensed to it under this
Agreement to any Person without the prior express written consent of Licensor,
which consent may be granted, conditioned or withheld in Licensor's sole
discretion. Any sublicense purported to be granted by Licensee without
Licensor's prior express written consent shall be null and void.

  

  

2.3 Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties. Other than as set out in
Section 3.1(29) of the Share Purchase Agreement, Licensor does not provide,
and hereby disclaims, any representations, warranties, guarantees or
conditions of any kind with respect to the Trade-marks, whether express or
implied, including any representations, warranties, guarantees or conditions
of non-infringement.

ARTICLE 3

  

REBRANDING

  

  

3.1 Transitional Rebranding. Licensee shall employ commercially reasonable
efforts (at its own cost) to, as soon as practicable after the Effective Date,
transition to using trade-marks and trade names that do not contain or
comprise the Trade-marks or any trade-marks or trade names confusing similar
thereto, such that all use by Licensee of the Trade-marks or any trade name of
other indicia which Licensor has the right to control, has ceased no later
than the end of the SLI Term or the SLC Term, as the case may be.
Specifically, Licensee shall, prior to the end of the SLI Term or the SLC
Term, as the case may be, cease any and all use of the Trade-marks, or any
words, designs or expressions confusingly similar thereto:

  

  

    

(1)

  |  

as part of a corporate name, business name, or trade name;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(2)

  |  

as part of a domain name, e-mail address, keyword, or social media username;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(3)

  |  

on any Materials, regardless of medium; and

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(4)

  |  

from all real and personal property,

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

and replace all references to the Trade-marks with such names and logos as
chosen by Licensee and as permitted by Section 4.2 and this Section 3.1. Where
it is not possible to replace a reference to a Trade-mark, Licensee shall (i)
in the case of a corporate or business name, cancel the corporate or business
name registration (subject to the receipt of necessary Regulatory Approvals);
(ii) in the case of a domain name, assign the domain name to Licensor; and
(iii) in the case of Materials, at Licensor's sole discretion, destroy or
deliver up to Licensor all Materials bearing a Trade-mark. Licensee shall also
employ reasonable best efforts (at its own cost) to, as soon as possible,
terminate any licenses or sublicenses to use any of the Trade-marks to which
any Distributor is a party.

  

  

3.2 Extension for Pending Regulatory Approval. If Licensee (i) cannot cease
use of an SLI Trade-mark as part of a corporate name, business name, or trade
name as the result of a delay in receiving a required Regulatory Approval
related to a corporate name, business name, or trade name used in relation to
the SLI Business, and (ii) has taken commercially reasonable efforts during
the SLI Term to obtain the required Regulatory Approval, then the SLI Term
shall be extended by 14 days, only as it relates to the use of the SLI Trade-
marks as part of the affected corporate name, business name, or trade name.
Should the required Regulatory Approval not be received by the Licensee prior
to the end of the extended SLI Term, then the parties shall negotiate in good
faith subsequent 14 days extensions until the required Regulatory Approval is
received.

  

  

3.3 Signage. Notwithstanding Section 3.1, Licensee shall within six (6) months
from the Effective Date cease any and all use of the SLC Trade-marks, or any
words, designs or expressions confusingly similar thereto on all Signage.

  

  

3.4 Domain Names. In respect of the domain names set out in Schedule "D" which
are in active use as of the Effective Date, Licensor agrees that during the
SLC Term, it shall, or it shall cause its Affiliates to, ensure that all
Persons attempting to access any web page associated with

  

  

  


   

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  

 

- 7 -

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

any such domain names will be redirected to websites of the Purchaser (or its
Affiliate), as may be directed in writing by the Purchaser. With respect to
the domain names [redacted], [redacted], [redacted], and [redacted], Licensor
agrees that during the SLI Term, it shall, or it shall cause its Affiliates
to, ensure that all Persons attempting to access any web page associated with
any such domain names will be redirected to websites of the Purchaser (or its
Affiliate), as may be directed in writing by the Purchaser.

  

  

3.5 Historical Documentation. For the avoidance of doubt, Licensor hereby
acknowledges and agrees that the Trade-marks appear or are used on agreements,
registrations or other documents entered into by Licensee or Permitted
Sublicensees prior to the Effective Date and that nothing in this Agreement or
the Share Purchase Agreement shall require Licensee to amend such agreements,
registrations or other documents to reflect the change of Licensee's corporate
name or trade name either during or after the Term.

  

  

ARTICLE 4

  

TRADE-MARK OWNERSHIP USE AND MAINTENANCE

  

  

4.1 Acknowledgement of Rights. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that:

  

  

    

(1)

  |  

the Trade-marks are the exclusive property of Licensor or the Licensor has the
right to grant the licence set out in section 2.1;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(2)

---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(3)

  |

QUALITY

  

  

5.1 Quality. Licensee shall at all times during the SLI Term and the SLC Term,
as the case may be conduct the Target Business employing the Trade-marks in a
manner equal to or better than the quality of the Target Business immediately
prior to the Effective Date (the "Standards").

  

  

5.2 Standards. Licensee shall use the Trade-marks only in association with the

offers in association with the Trade-marks and any relevant documents

Licensor in writing of any act of infringement, passing off or unauthorized
use of the Trade-marks which comes to its attention. Licensor may take any
action in its own name and at its cost and expense to prevent or enjoin any

third party against Licensee arising out of its use of the Trade-marks,

proceeding, but shall have no obligation to do so. Licensee shall, at
Licensor's cost and expense, fully cooperate with and assist Licensor, provide
any evidence and available information to Licensor, execute such documents and
do such acts and things as in the opinion of Licensor, acting reasonably, may
be necessary. If Licensor elects not to defend such claim, action or
proceeding, Licensee may do so at its own cost and expense.
