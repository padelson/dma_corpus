Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under this Agreement) of the
conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ (as they may be amended in accordance with

(ii) reduce the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in the
Offer, (iii) change, modify or waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (iv) add to
the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ or modify or change any Offer

(b) _Expiration of the Offer_. The Offer shall expire at midnight at the end
of the date that is twenty (20) business days after the commencement of the
Offer (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the Exchange Act) (such time, or
such subsequent time to which the expiration of the Offer is extended in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration Time_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to the provisions of Article VIII, (i)
if at the Expiration Time, any Offer Condition shall not have been satisfied
or waived (to the extent permitted under applicable Law), Merger Sub may, in
its sole discretion, without the consent of the Company, extend the Offer for
one or more consecutive increments of not more than ten (10) Business Days
each (the length of such period to be determined by Parent or Merger Sub),
until the earlier of (A) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms and (B) the Outside Date and (ii) if at the Expiration Time, any
Offer Condition shall not have been satisfied or waived (to the extent
permitted under applicable Law), Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to), extend the Offer at the request of the Company for one or more
consecutive increments of not more than ten (10) Business Days each (the
length of such period to be determined by Parent or Merger Sub after
consultation with the Company), until the earlier of (A) the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (B) the Outside Date. Merger
Sub shall extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ "), the staff thereof or the NASDAQ Stock Market ("
_NASDAQ_ ") applicable to the Offer or as may be required by any other
Governmental Entity; _provided_ , that Merger Sub shall not be required to
extend the Offer to a date later than the Outside Date. Nothing contained in
this _Section 1.1(b)_ shall affect any termination rights in _Article VIII_.

immediately following the Expiration Time and (ii) pay for all such shares
(subject to any applicable Tax withholding pursuant to _Section 3.2(h)_ ) as
soon as practicable after the Expiration Time. The Offer Price payable in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash, without interest, on
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement. Acceptance for
payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to and subject to the
conditions of the Offer upon the expiration of the Offer is referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing_ ," and the date on which the Offer

stockholders of the Company as and to the extent required by United States
federal securities Laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Schedule TO to

all information concerning the Company required by the Exchange Act to be set

of the Company, in each case as soon as reasonably practicable and as and to
the extent required by applicable United States federal securities Laws.

any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or
supplements, to the Offer Documents, and shall promptly provide the Company

the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Prior to the filing of the Offer
Documents (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or
dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Merger Sub
shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such Offer Documents or response, and Parent and Merger Sub
shall give reasonable, good faith consideration to any such comments.

  


 

  

(e) At or prior to the Offer Closing Date, Parent will authorize and duly
adopt, execute and deliver, and will ensure that a duly qualified Rights Agent
executes and delivers, the CVR Agreement, subject to any reasonable revisions
to the CVR Agreement that are requested by such Rights Agent ( _provided_ that
such revisions are not, individually or in the aggregate, detrimental to any
CVR holder, other than in immaterial respects).

  


 

  

(f) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the consideration necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common
Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for,
pursuant to the Offer.

(b) To the extent reasonably practicable, on the date the Offer Documents are
filed with the SEC (and, in any event, within one (1) Business Day thereof),
the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, together with
any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") containing
the Company Recommendation and shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the
stockholders of the Company as and to the extent required by Rule 14d-9 under
the Exchange Act. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all
material respects with the Exchange Act and all other applicable Law. Parent
and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all information

in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly correct any information supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company
shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and
to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the
SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case as soon
as reasonably practicable and as and to the extent required by applicable
United States federal securities Laws. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any request from the
SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall promptly
provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Prior to the

give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments. The Company
hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company
Recommendation.

  


 

  

(c) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall cause its
transfer agent to furnish Parent and Merger Sub promptly, and in any event
within five (5) Business Days of the date hereof, with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Company Common
Stock as of the latest practicable date and of those persons becoming record

assistance (including periodically updated lists of stockholders, security
position listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in
communicating the Offer to holders of Company Common Stock. Subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Offer and the Merger, Parent and Merger Sub and their agents
(x) shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels,
listings and files and will use such information only in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and (y) following the termination of this Agreement,
shall promptly, at the election of Parent, deliver to the Company or destroy,
and will use their reasonable best efforts to cause their agents to deliver to

 _EFFECTS OF THE MERGER; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

  


 

  

Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock._ Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any shares of Company Common Stock:

  


 

  

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i)
shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent, (ii) shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section
3.1(c)_ and (iii) the Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive (A) an amount in cash, per share of Company Common Stock, equal to the
Cash Consideration and (B) one (1) CVR subject to and in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the CVR Agreement in each case, without any interest
and subject to any applicable Tax withholding in accordance with _Section
3.2(h)_ (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), upon surrender of such
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)_ and in compliance
therewith. As of the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease
to exist, and each holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

  

 

7  

  

(b) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, $0.01
par value, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock,
$0.01 par value, of the Surviving Corporation, and the shares of the Surviving
Corporation into which the shares of Merger Sub common stock are so converted
shall be the only shares of the Surviving Corporation that are issued and
outstanding immediately after the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(c) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Each share, if any, of Company Common
Stock that is held by the Company as a treasury share and each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company or Parent or by any direct
or indirect wholly owned Company Subsidiary or Parent shall be canceled
without any conversion, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable
in exchange therefor.

  


 

  

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_

  


 

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall engage a
financial institution designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the
Company to act as paying agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying
Agent_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, deposit with the Paying Agent, in trust for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time, the aggregate Cash Consideration in respect of the Company
Common Stock, it being understood that any and all interest or other amounts
earned with respect to such funds shall be for the account of and turned over
to Parent in accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_ (it being understood and agreed,
for the avoidance of doubt, that Parent shall not be required to deposit any
funds related to any CVR with the Rights Agent unless and until such deposit
is required pursuant to the terms of the CVR Agreement). All cash deposited
with the Paying Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_."

  


 

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail,
promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days following the Effective Time), to each holder of record of (i) a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
") or (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-
entry (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "), in each case, which at the Effective
Time were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.1_ , (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form
(which, in the case of Certificates, shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon (1)
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent or receipt of
an "agent's message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and (2) such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
amount of the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to _Section 3.1_ , and any Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. If the Merger Consideration (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
payment in the form of or with respect to the CVRs) is to be paid to any
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result
of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of Parent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 3.2(b)_ , each share of Company Common Stock
represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration upon such surrender.

  

 

8  

  

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
III_.

  


 

  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock six (6) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim
for the Merger Consideration, subject to subsection (e) below.

  


 

  

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Paying
Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents
shall be liable to any Person in respect of Merger Consideration delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall not have been
surrendered prior to six (6) years after the Effective Time, any cash
remaining in the Exchange Fund at that time shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

 

9  

  

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. If Parent determines to invest the Exchange
Fund, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to invest the Exchange Fund in
direct short-term obligations of, or obligations fully guaranteed by the full
faith and credit of, the United States of America or in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or a combination of the
foregoing, and, in each case, with maturities not exceeding three (3) months
or money market mutual funds comprised of any of the foregoing. To the extent
there are losses with respect to such investments or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for any other reasons below the level required to make prompt cash
payment of the aggregate funds required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement,
Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly deposit additional funds
into the Exchange Fund such that the funds held in the Exchange Fund are
thereafter sufficient to satisfy the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
hereunder. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall
become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts
payable pursuant to this _Article III_ shall promptly be paid to Parent.

  


 

  

(g) _Certain Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, in the event that, during the period between the date hereof and
the Effective Time, the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Company Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares or
securities or a different class, including as a result of a reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction, then the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be equitably adjusted,
without duplication, to reflect such change; _provided_ that, in any case,
nothing in this _Section 3.2(g)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to
take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms
of this Agreement.

as indemnity, against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Paying
Agent in respect of the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

"Dissenting Shares") shall not be exchangeable for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled

thereon. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisals of shares of Company Common Stock and

cancelled or is no longer in full force and effect except, with respect to

Company, there has not occurred any violation of, default (with or without
notice or lapse of time or both) under, or event giving rise to any threat of
termination, amendment or cancellation of, with or without notice or lapse of
time or both, any Regulatory Authorization (except as would not be material

or failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause (a)(i) any representation or
warranty of such party contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to
"materiality," or "Company Material Adverse Effect" to be untrue or inaccurate
in any respect or (ii) any other representation or warranty of such party
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, in each case at any time from and after the date hereof until the
Offer Closing or (b) any material failure of Parent or Merger Sub or the
Company, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement. In
addition, (A) the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any change or
event having, or which would be reasonably likely to have, a Company Material
Adverse Effect, (B) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, as the case may be, of any change
or event which would be reasonably likely to result in the failure of any of
the conditions set forth in Exhibit A to be satisfied and (C) each of Parent
and the Company shall give prompt notice to the other after receiving or
becoming aware of any notice or other communication from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section 6.3 shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with,
any other provision of this Agreement, (ii) limit or otherwise affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties, or (iii)
limit the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

Section 6.4 _Antitrust Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts._

  


 

  

(a) Each party shall make or cause to be made, in cooperation with the other
parties and to the extent applicable and as promptly as practicable, (i) no
later than fifteen (15) Business Days following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions and (ii) all other
necessary filings, forms, declarations, notifications, registrations and
notices with other Governmental Entities under Competition Laws relating to
the Transactions. Each party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
respond at the earliest practicable date to any requests for additional
information made by the FTC or any other Governmental Entities, and act in
good faith and reasonably cooperate with the other party in connection with
any investigation of any Governmental Entity. Each party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to each other party all information
required for any filing, form, declaration, notification, registration and
notice with respect to Competition Laws and the Transactions. Each party shall
give the other parties reasonable prior notice of any communication with, and
any proposed understanding or agreement with, any Governmental Entity
regarding any filings, forms, declarations, notifications, registrations or
notices with respect to Competition Laws and the Transactions, and permit the
other parties to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of the other parties in connection with, any proposed communication,
understanding or agreement with any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Transactions; provided however, that materials may be redacted or withheld (i)
as necessary to comply with contractual agreements, (ii) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns and (iii) to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries. None of the parties shall independently participate in any
meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation, with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings or inquiry with respect to Competition Laws
and the Transactions without giving the other parties prior notice of the
meeting and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to
attend and/or participate. The parties will consult and cooperate with one
another in connection with any information or proposals submitted in
connection with proceedings under or relating to any Competition Law. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall each use its commercially
reasonable efforts (A) to avoid the entry of any judgment that would restrain,
prevent or delay the Closing, (B) to eliminate every impediment under any
Competition Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event
no later than the Outside Date) and (C) vigorously to contest and resist any
such action or proceeding, including any administrative or judicial action.
Parent shall control and lead all communications and strategy relating to the
Competition Laws (provided that the Company is not constrained from complying
with applicable Law), provided, further, that the Parties shall consult and
cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one
another, regarding the form and content of any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of either Party in connection with proceedings under
or relating to any Competition Law.

  

 

48  

  

(b) Subject to _Section 6.4(c)_ , each of the parties to this Agreement agrees
to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties to this Agreement in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of all other necessary actions
or nonactions, waivers, consents, licenses, permits, authorizations, orders
and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all other necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities, if
any), (ii) the obtaining of all consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties necessary to consummate the Transactions, (iii) the preparation of any
documents that may be required to be filed with the SEC, (iv) the execution
and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate
any of the Transactions, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement and (v) the providing of all such information concerning such party,
its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates as well as the officers, directors,
employees and partners of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, in each case, as
may be reasonably requested in connection with any of the matters set forth in
_Section 6.4(a)_ or this _Section 6.4(b)_.

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.4_ or any
other provision of this Agreement, Parent or its Affiliates shall not be
required, and the Company and its Affiliates shall not agree with a Government
Entity without prior consent of Parent, to divest any of its businesses,
product lines or assets, hold separate or take or agree to take any other
action or agree to any limitation or restriction in order to resolve any
objections asserted under Competition Laws by any Governmental Entity with
respect to any of the Transactions if such action (i) would, or would
reasonably be expected to, materially and adversely affect the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) would, or would reasonably be
expected to, materially impair the benefits sought to be derived by Parent
from the Transactions (taking into account, among other things, effects on the
assets, business and operations and relationships of both Parent and its
Subsidiaries and of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) or (iii) causes
Parent to sell, divest, hold separate, license, cause a third party to
acquire, or otherwise dispose of any material operations, divisions,
businesses, product lines, customers or assets of Parent or its Subsidiaries,
or any other actions that may materially limit Parent's freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, any of its Subsidiaries, material
operations, divisions, businesses, product lines, customers or assets (with
materiality being measured based on the size of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (any such action being referred to herein as
an " _Adverse Regulatory Requirement_ ").

  

 

49  

  

Section 6.5 _No Solicitation; Company Recommendation._

  


 

  

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the
Company's and Company Subsidiaries' respective Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal, and
concurrently therewith shall request the return from, or destruction by, all
such Persons of all copies of confidential information previously furnished to
such Persons by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Company's and
Company Subsidiaries' respective Representatives, in connection with exploring
any Company Takeover Proposal prior to the date hereof and shall terminate
access to any data room (electronic or otherwise) by any Person other than
Parent and its Representatives. The Company shall not, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries and the Company's and Company Subsidiaries' respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate,
facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing or providing access to
non-public information with the intent of encouraging the making, submission
or announcement of any Company Takeover Proposal), any inquiries or proposals
that constitute, or which would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company
Takeover Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions (other than to refer to
this Agreement) or negotiations with any third party regarding any Company
Takeover Proposal, (iii) approve any transaction under, or any Person (other
than Parent or Merger Sub) becoming an "interested stockholder" under, Section
203 of the DGCL (except in connection with the Transactions) or (iv) enter
into any merger or other agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent,
term sheet, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
instrument constituting or related to any Company Takeover Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if after the date hereof but prior to the Offer
Closing Date the Company Board receives an unsolicited, bona fide written
Company Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof but prior to the Offer
Closing Date, that did not result from or arise in connection with a breach of
this _Section 6.5(a) (other than an immaterial breach)_ , and the Company
Board determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that such
Company Takeover Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, a Superior Proposal, then the Company may, if the Company Board determines
(after consultation with outside counsel) that failure to take such actions
would be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties to the
Company's stockholders under applicable Law, and subject to compliance with
this _Section 6.5(a)_ and _Section 6.5(b)_ , at any time prior to the Offer
Closing Date (but in no event after the Offer Closing Date) and after
providing Parent not less than forty-eight (48) hours prior written notice of
such determination by the Company Board (A) furnish information with respect
to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such Company
Takeover Proposal, but only after such Person enters into a customary
confidentiality agreement with terms substantially similar to, and with a
standstill not less restrictive, and other provisions not less restrictive
(other than in an immaterial respect) than, those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (including the "standstill" covenant); _provided_ ,
that (1) such confidentiality agreement may not include any provision calling
for an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and (2) the Company
provides Parent, in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, any non-public information with respect to the Company furnished to
such other Person which was not previously furnished to Parent prior to the
time it is provided to such other Person, which information shall be treated
in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, and (B)
participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person regarding such
Company Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood
that any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any Company Subsidiaries
or the Company's or the Company Subsidiaries' respective Representatives shall
be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.5_ by the Company.

  

 

50  

  

(b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
_Section 6.5_ , the Company shall promptly advise Parent, orally and in
writing (and in any case within twenty-four (24) hours of knowledge of
receipt) of the receipt by the Company of any Company Takeover Proposal, or
any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Takeover
Proposal, or any request for information relating to the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books
or records of the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any third party with
respect to a Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall, in any such notice
to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making such Company Takeover
Proposal, indication or request, and the terms and conditions of such Company
Takeover Proposal, indication or request (and shall include with such notice
copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such Person
relating to such Company Takeover Proposal, indication or request), and
thereafter shall promptly keep Parent reasonably informed, in a prompt manner,
of all material developments affecting the status and terms of any such
Company Takeover Proposal, indication or request or any changes to the terms
thereof (and the Company shall provide Parent promptly after receipt or
delivery thereof with copies of any additional written materials received that
relate to such Company Takeover Proposal, indication or request or any changes
to the terms thereof) and of the status of any such discussions or
negotiations. In addition, during the period from the date hereof through the
Effective Time, the Company shall enforce, and not terminate, amend, modify or
waive (except for waiver of any standstill provisions to allow such
counterparty to make a proposal to the Company Board) any provision of any
confidentiality agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party.

  


 

  

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.5_ , neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub,
the Company Recommendation, (B) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Company
Takeover Proposal or take any action or make any public statement that is
inconsistent with the Company Recommendation, (C) take any formal action or
make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer
or any exchange offer from any third party, other than (1) a recommendation
against such offer, (2) a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation
M-A or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or (3) a customary "stop, look and
listen" communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act, or (D) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the
Schedule 14D-9 (any action described in this clause (i) a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, or cause or authorize the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
memorandum of understanding, merger, acquisition, purchase or joint venture
agreement or other agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended
to or reasonably expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal (other
than a confidentiality agreement in accordance with _Section 6.5(a)_ ) (each,
a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ "). It is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions on the Company set forth in this _Section 6.5_ by any officer,
director or any other Representative of the Company shall be deemed a breach
of this _Section 6.5_ by the Company.

  

 

51  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but subject to
_Section 6.5(f)_ , prior to the Offer Closing Date, the Company Board may (i)
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, if (A) the Company Board
determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with outside
counsel) that failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with the
Company Board's fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under
applicable Law and (B) the Company Board (1) receives after the date hereof
but before the Offer Closing Date an unsolicited, bona fide written Company
Takeover Proposal that did not result from or arise in connection with a
breach of this _Section 6.5_ (other than in any immaterial respect) and (2)
determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with outside counsel
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that such Company
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and authorizes the Company
to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal and/or (ii) following or concurrently with making a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with clause (i) and _Section 6.5(f)_ ,
authorizes the Company to terminate this Agreement and enter into a Company
Acquisition Agreement if, concurrently with entering into such Company
Acquisition Agreement the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ and pays the Termination Fee required pursuant to
_Section 8.3_.

  


 

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but subject to
_Section 6.5(f)_ , the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change for a reason unrelated to a Company Takeover Proposal if the Company
Board determines (based on a written opinion of outside counsel) that, in
light of material facts, events or circumstances in each case related to the
Company that have developed since the date of this Agreement that did not
exist to the knowledge of the Company prior to the date hereto, failure to
take such actions would be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary
duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable Law.

  


 

  

(f) The Company Board shall not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to _Section 6.5(d)_ unless (i) the Company promptly provides written
notice to Parent at least five (5) Business Days before taking such action
(the " _Notice Period_ ") advising Parent that the Company Board is
considering making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, which notice shall
(A) specify the material terms of the applicable Company Takeover Proposal,
identify the Person making such Superior Proposal and include copies of any
written materials relating to such Company Takeover Proposal or (B) in the
case of any action intended to be taken pursuant to Section 6.5(e), contain a
reasonably detailed description of the underlying facts giving rise to, and
the reasons for taking, such action (the " _Company Notice of Adverse
Recommendation_ ") and (ii) during the Notice Period, the Company and its
Representatives shall have, if requested by Parent, negotiated in good faith
with Parent and Parent's Representatives to make such adjustments in the terms
of this Agreement as would enable Parent to proceed with the Transactions on
such adjusted terms and, at the end of such Notice Period, after taking into
account any such adjusted terms as may have been proposed by Parent since its
receipt of such written notice, the Company Board shall have again in good
faith made the determination referred to in clause (i)(B)(2) of _Section
6.5(d)_ or _Section 6.5(e)_ , as applicable. To the extent the Notice Period
described in the preceding sentence would expire after the Offer Closing Date,
the Offer Closing Date shall be automatically extended such that it will occur
on the first Business Day after the expiration of the Notice Period. In the
event of any material change (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
change in price) to the terms of a Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in
each case, make the determination referred to in clause (i)(B)(2) of _Section
6.5(d)_ , deliver a new Company Notice of Adverse Recommendation and commence
a new Notice Period except that the duration of the Notice Period shall be
reduced to 48 hours (rather than three (3) Business Days).

  

 

52  

  

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

  


 

  

" _Company Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer (whether
in writing or otherwise) from any Person or "group" (as defined in Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act), other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, relating
to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or
a series of related transactions) of assets of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries (including securities of the Company Subsidiaries) equal
to more than 15% of the Company's consolidated assets or to which more than
15% of the Company's revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are
attributable, (B) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions or by merger, consolidation or
otherwise) of more than 15% of any class of equity securities of the Company
or any Company Subsidiaries or (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d)
of the Exchange Act) beneficially owning more than 15% of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries or of any resulting
parent company of the Company, other than the Transactions.

  


 

  

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal
(substituting references to "15%" therein with "50%") that did not arise from
a breach of this _Section 6.5_ (other than an immaterial breach), is obtained
after the date hereof but prior to the Offer Closing Date, with no financing
contingency and that the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment
(after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) to be (a) more favorable to the stockholders of the
Company from a financial point of view than the Offer and the Merger, taking
into account all relevant factors (including all the terms and conditions of
such proposal and the Offer and this Agreement (including any changes to the
terms of the Offer and this Agreement proposed by Parent in accordance with
_Section 6.5(e)_ )) and (b) reasonably capable of being completed in
accordance with its terms, taking into account all financial, regulatory,
legal and other aspects and terms of such proposal and the third party.

  


 

  

(h) For purposes of this _Section 6.5_ , the term " _Representatives_ " shall
mean directors, officers, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors,
authorized agents, employees at or above the level of vice-president or
director and accountants.

  


 

  

(i) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking and
disclosing to the Company's stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act
or making any disclosure to its stockholders required pursuant to the rules
and regulations of the SEC if the Company Board determines (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) that failure to take such actions would be
inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties to the Company's
stockholders under applicable Law. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit
the accurate disclosure of factual information (and such disclosure shall not
be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change) regarding (x) the
business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company or (y)
the fact that a Company Takeover Proposal has been made, the identity of the
party making such proposal or the material terms of such proposal to the
extent, in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y), (1) the Company in good
faith determines that such information, facts, identity and/or terms is
required to be disclosed under applicable Law and (2) any such disclosure
includes the Company Recommendation without disclosing or effecting a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change.

  

 

53  

  

Section 6.6 _Stockholder Litigation._ The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate (at Parent's expense) in the defense or settlement
of any stockholder Litigation against the Company and its directors relating
to the any of the Transactions; provided, however, that no such settlement
shall be agreed to without Parent's prior written consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except that Parent shall
not be obligated to consent to any settlement which does not include a full
release of the Company, Parent and its Affiliates or which imposes an
injunction or other equitable relief upon the Company, Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation).

  


 

  

Section 6.7 _Indemnification; Director and Officer Insurance._ For not less
than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees to, and to
cause the Surviving Corporation to, (a) indemnify and hold harmless all past
and present directors, officers and employees of the Company to the same
extent such Persons are indemnified as of the date hereof by the Company
pursuant to the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company Bylaws and
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof with any
directors, officers or employees of the Company for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and (b) advance expenses as
incurred to the extent provided for under such indemnification agreements;
provided, however, that Parent agrees to, and to cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless such Persons to the fullest extent
permitted by Law for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of any of the Transactions.
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for an aggregate
period of not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Company's current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification
policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (the "DandO Insurance") that is no less favorable than the
Company's existing policy or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage
is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the
DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the
date hereof; provided, that (a) Parent may substitute therefor a single
premium tail coverage with respect to DandO Insurance at a level at least as
favorable as in the DandO Insurance, or (b) if Parent does not make the
substitution provided for in clause (a), then the Surviving Corporation may
substitute therefor a single premium tail coverage with respect to DandO
Insurance at a level at least as favorable as in the DandO Insurance for a
premium not to exceed 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date
hereof. If the Surviving Corporation or Parent, or any of their successors or
assigns, shall (i) be liquidated and dissolved, (ii) consolidate with or merge
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of
such consolidation or merger or (iii) sell or otherwise transfer all or a
majority of its assets to any other Person, proper provisions shall be made so
that the continuing or surviving entity or Parent, as applicable, and its
successors and assigns shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section
6.7. The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time,
shall thereafter not be terminated or amended in any manner so as to adversely
affect (in any material respect) any indemnified party described in this
Section 6.7, are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each indemnified party described in this Section 6.7 and his or her heirs
and Representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitute for, any
other rights that any such person may have by Contract or otherwise.

  

 

54  

  

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements._ The parties agree that the initial press
release(s) to be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be in the
form(s) agreed to by the parties. Except with respect to any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with each other before
making, and give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon, any press release or other public statements (including broad-based
employee communications) with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions,
and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such reasonably practicable consultation, except as may be required
by applicable Law, NASDAQ, the New York Stock Exchange or court process, in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to allow each other party reasonable time
to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

  


 

  

Section 6.9 _Employees_ _._

  


 

  

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Offer Closing, Parent shall or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to either (i) provide the employees of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who are employed immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Covered Employees_ ") who remain employed during
such period by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries with compensation and benefits which, taken as a whole, have a
value substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the compensation and
benefits provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof or (ii) provide or cause the Surviving Corporation (or, in such case,
its successors or assigns) to provide Covered Employees who remain employed
during such period by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective
Subsidiaries with compensation and benefits which, taken as a whole, have a
value substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries; provided,
however, in either case, neither Parent nor Surviving Corporation shall be
required to provide any equity based compensation. Parent shall have no
obligation and the Company shall take no action that would have the effect of
requiring Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific plans
or to continue the employment of any specific Person.

  


 

  

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate in, and non-
forfeitable rights under any employee benefit plan or arrangement of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries (including
for purposes of vacation eligibility), but not for purposes of benefit accrual
under any defined benefit pension plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
Covered Employees shall receive service credit for service with the Company
(and with any predecessor or acquired entities or any other entities for which
the Company granted service credit) as if such service had been completed with
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to
the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits
for the same period of service.

  

 

55  

  

(c) To the extent applicable, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and any of their respective Subsidiaries to waive, or use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its insurance carriers to waive, any
pre-existing condition limitation on participation and coverage applicable to
any Covered Employee or any of his or her covered dependents under any health
or welfare plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (a " _New Plan_ ") in which such Covered Employee or
covered dependent shall become eligible to participate after the Effective
Time to the extent such Covered Employee or covered dependent was no longer
subject to such pre-existing condition limitation under the corresponding
Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee or such covered dependent
was participating immediately before he or she became eligible to participate
in the New Plan. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or the
relevant Subsidiary of either to provide each Covered Employee with credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time and during
the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs under any Company Benefit
Plan in satisfying any applicable co-payment and deductible requirements for
such calendar year under any New Plan in which such Covered Employee
participates after the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(d) If requested by Parent prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
terminate, or cause to the have terminated, the Company's 401(k) and Profit
Sharing Plan as of the date immediately preceding the Closing Date. All
resolutions and other documents issued, adopted or executed in connection with
such termination shall be subject to Parent's reasonable prior review and
comment.

  


 

  

(e) No provision of this Agreement shall (i) confer any rights or remedies of
any kind or description upon any Covered Employee or any other Person other
than the Company and Parent and their respective successors and assigns, (ii)
be construed as an amendment, waiver or creation of or limitation on the
ability to terminate any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or
benefit plan or agreement of Parent (including any New Plan) or (iii) limit
the ability of the Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Covered
Employee at any time.

  


 

  

(f) _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company will not, on or after the date hereof and prior to the

if any. Each Debt Payoff Letter shall (A) confirm the aggregate principal

Commercial Code termination statements, terminations and releases of
outstanding mortgages, and security interests as are reasonably necessary to

Payoff Amount, all tangible collateral (including, without limitation, all
equity certificates and related transfers or assignments in blank) securing
the obligations under the Credit Agreement held in Regions Bank's possession
shall be promptly delivered to the Company or its designee. Prior to or at the
Offer Closing Date, the Company shall have obtained documents, including
executed terminations and releases of outstanding mortgages and security
interests, including intellectual property security agreements as are

Company Subsidiaries shall have no Indebtedness.

  


 

  

Section 6.13 _Deregistration; Stock Exchange Delisting._ After the Offer
Closing, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,

the conditions of this Agreement. In furtherance, and without limiting the
generality, of the foregoing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, and shall
not permit and shall cause their respective Affiliates or Representatives not
to, take any action that could render Section 251(h) of the DGCL inapplicable
to the Merger.

on _Exhibit A_ hereto have theretofore been satisfied or waived or shall then

Agreement by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1, this

within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement to consummate a Company Takeover Proposal or consummates
a Company Takeover Proposal (regardless of whether such Company Takeover

provided, that for purposes of this _Section 8.3(b)(i)_ (A), the term "Company

6.5(g)_ , except that the references to "15%" shall be deemed to be references
to "50%"; or

  


 

  

(C) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ ,
_Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ or _Section 8.1(c)(iv_ ); or

  


 

  

(D) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_ ;

  

 

61  

  

then the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to $6,200,000 (six million two

a termination described in clause (D), (y) within five (5) Business Days after

or (B); _provided_ , that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  


 

  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, absent fraud
or willful breach, the parties agree that the payment of the Termination Fee
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub
against the Company and its Affiliates with respect to this Agreement in the
event the Termination Fee becomes due and payable under the terms of this
Agreement, and, upon payment of the Termination Fee, neither the Company, nor
any Company Subsidiary, shall have any further liability to Parent and Merger
Sub relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions.

  


 

  

(iii) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.3(b)_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these
agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the
Company fails promptly to pay the amount(s) due pursuant to this _Section
8.3(b)_ , and, to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which results
in a judgment against the Company for the amount(s) due pursuant to this
_Section 8.3(b)_ , the Company shall pay to Parent its out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount(s) at the prime rate of Citibank,

conditions to its own obligations. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party by its duly authorized
officer. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights. The waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and
other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other
facts and circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right
that may be asserted at any time and from time to time. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive
of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

 _CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS_

  


 

  

SECTION 2.1 _Holders of CVRs; Appointment of Rights Agent_.

  


 

  

(a) Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, (i) each holder of any
Shares or Company Restricted Stock Awards that are converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to one CVR for each such
Share or Company Restricted Stock Award and (ii) each holder of any Company
Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
entitled to one CVR for each Share underlying such Company Option.

  


 

  

(b) Parent hereby appoints the Rights Agent to act as rights agent for Parent
in accordance with the express terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and the Rights Agent hereby accepts such appointment.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.2 _Nontransferable_. CVRs may not be sold, assigned, transferred,
pledged, encumbered or disposed of in any other manner, in whole or in part,
other than pursuant to a Permitted Transfer. Any attempted sale, assignment,
transfer, pledge, encumbrance or disposition of CVRs, in whole or in part, in
violation of this _Section 2.2_ shall be void ab initio and of no effect.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.3 _No Certificate; Registration; Registration of Transfer; Change of
Address_.

  


 

  

(a) CVRs shall not be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument.

  


 

  

(b) The Rights Agent shall keep a register (the "CVR Register") for the
purposes of (i) identifying the Holders of CVRs and (ii) registering CVRs and
Permitted Transfers thereof.

  


 

  

(c) Without limiting the restriction on transferability set forth in _Section
2.2_ , every request made to transfer a CVR must be in writing and accompanied
by a written instrument of transfer and other requested documentation in form
reasonably satisfactory to the Rights Agent, duly executed by the registered
Holder or Holders thereof, or by the duly appointed legal representative,
personal representative or survivor of such Holder or Holders, setting forth
in reasonable detail the circumstances relating to the transfer demonstrating
that such proposed transfer is a Permitted Transfer. Upon receipt of such
written notice, the Rights Agent shall notify Parent that it has received such
written notice. Upon receipt of such notice from the Rights Agent, Parent
shall in good faith reasonably determine whether the transfer is a Permitted
Transfer and otherwise complies with the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement, and if Parent so reasonably determines that such transfer does so
comply, Parent shall instruct the Rights Agent in writing to register the
transfer of the applicable CVRs in the CVR Register. All duly transferred CVRs
registered in the CVR Register shall be the valid obligations of Parent,
evidencing the same right, and entitling the transferee to the same benefits
and rights under this Agreement, as those held by the transferor. No transfer
of a CVR shall be valid until registered in the CVR Register in accordance
with this Agreement. Any transfer or assignment of CVRs shall be without
charge (other than the cost of any transfer tax or similar tax or charge) to
the applicable Holder. Parent and the Rights Agent may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any stamp or other tax or charge that is imposed in
connection with any such registration of transfer.

  

  

 

5  

  

(d) A Holder may make a written request to the Rights Agent to change such
Holder's address of record in the CVR Register. Such written request must be
duly executed by such Holder. Upon receipt of such written request, the Rights
Agent shall promptly record the change of address in the CVR Register.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.4 _Payment Procedures_.

  


 

  

(a) _Milestone 1_. If the Milestone 1 Target is achieved during the Milestone
Achievement Period, then no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day after
Parent files its first Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or Annual Report on Form
10-K, as applicable ("SEC Report"), with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") following the end of the four (4) consecutive calendar
quarters during which the Milestone 1 Target is achieved, Parent shall deliver
to the Rights Agent (i) a certificate (the "Milestone 1 Compliance
Certificate") certifying that the Holders are entitled to receive the
Milestone 1 Payment and (ii) an amount in cash equal to the aggregate
Milestone 1 Payment with respect to the CVRs held by all Holders. The Rights
Agent shall promptly (and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after
receipt thereof by the Rights Agent) send to each Holder at its address set
forth in the CVR Register a copy of the Milestone 1 Compliance Certificate and
an amount in cash equal to the Milestone 1 Payment with respect to each CVR
held by such Holder. In the event that the Milestone 1 Target is not achieved
prior to the end of the Milestone Achievement Period, the Holders shall have
no right to receive the Milestone 1 Payment with respect to their CVRs.

  


 

  

(b) _Full Milestone 2_. If the Milestone 2 Target is achieved during the
Milestone Achievement Period, then no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day
after Parent files its first SEC Report following the end of the four (4)
consecutive calendar quarters during which the Milestone 2 Target is achieved,
Parent shall deliver to the Rights Agent (i) a certificate (the "Milestone 2
Compliance Certificate") certifying that the Holders are entitled to receive
the Full Milestone 2 Payment and (ii) an amount in cash equal to the aggregate
Full Milestone 2 Payment with respect to the CVRs held by all Holders. The
Rights Agent shall promptly (and in no event later than five (5) Business Days
after receipt thereof by the Rights Agent) send to each Holder at its address
set forth in the CVR Register a copy of the Milestone 2 Compliance Certificate
and an amount in cash equal to the Milestone 2 Payment with respect to each
CVR held by such Holder. In the event that the Milestone 2 Target is not
achieved prior to the end of the Milestone Achievement Period, the Holders
shall have no right to receive the Full Milestone 2 Payment with respect to
their CVRs. For the avoidance of doubt, if both the Milestone 1 Target and the
Milestone 2 Target are achieved based on Net Sales in overlapping four (4)
consecutive calendar quarters during the Milestone Achievement Period, both
the Milestone 1 Payment and the Full Milestone 2 Payment shall be made to
Holders in accordance with _Section 2.4(a)_ and _(b)_.

  


 

  

(c) _Partial Milestone 2_. If the Milestone 2 Target is not achieved during
the Milestone Achievement Period, but the Net Sales during the final full
calendar year of the Milestone Achievement Period exceed Fifty Five Million
Dollars ($55,000,000), then no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day after
Parent files its 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC, Parent shall
deliver to the Rights Agent (i) a certificate (the "Partial Milestone 2
Compliance Certificate") certifying that the Holders are entitled to receive
the Partial Milestone 2 Payment and (ii) an amount in cash equal to the
aggregate Partial Milestone 2 Payment with respect to the CVRs held by all
Holders. The Rights Agent shall promptly (and in no event later than five (5)
Business Days after receipt thereof by the Rights Agent) send to each Holder
at its address set forth in the CVR Register a copy of the Partial Milestone 2
Compliance Certificate and an amount in cash equal to the Partial Milestone 2
Payment with respect to each CVR held by such Holder. The Holders shall have
no right to receive any or all of the Partial Milestone 2 Payment in the event
that (A) the Milestone 1 Target is not achieved within the Milestone
Achievement Period or (B) the Milestone 2 Target is achieved during the
Milestone Achievement Period. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Milestone 1
Target is achieved during the Milestone Achievement Period but not until the
end of the Milestone Achievement Period based on the Net Sales during the
final full calendar year of the Milestone Achievement Period, and the Net
Sales during the final full calendar year of the Milestone Achievement Period
exceed Fifty Five Million Dollars ($55,000,000) but are less than Sixty Five
Million Dollars ($65,000,000), then the Holders shall have a right to receive
both the Milestone 1 Payment in accordance with _Section 2.4(a)_ and the
Partial Milestone 2 Payment in accordance with this _Section 2.4(c)_.

  

  

 

6  

  

(d) _Net Sales Statements_. No later than the fifth (5th) Business Day after
Parent files its first SEC Report following the end of each calendar quarter
during the Milestone Achievement Period commencing with the fourth (4th) full
calendar quarter after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the Rights
Agent a Net Sales Statement for the four calendar quarters most recently
ended. Upon the written request of any Holder, the Rights Agent shall deliver
to such Holder a copy of any Net Sales Statement so requested.

  


 

  

(e) _Non-Compliance Certificate_. If Parent determines that the Holders are
not entitled to receive (i) the Milestone 1 Payment or (ii) either the Full
Milestone 2 Payment or the Partial Milestone 2 Payment, pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, then no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day after
Parent files its 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC, Parent shall
deliver to the Rights Agent a certificate ("Non-Compliance Certificate")
setting forth such fact and indicating which Milestone Payment(s) the Holders
are not entitled to receive. The Rights Agent shall promptly (and in no event
later than five (5) Business Days after receipt thereof by the Rights Agent)
send to each Holder at its address set forth in the CVR Register a copy of the
Non-Compliance Certificate.

  


 

  

(f) _Independent Accountant Review_. Within ninety (90) days after the
delivery of a Non-Compliance Certificate by the Rights Agent pursuant to
_Section 2.4(e)_ (the "Non-Compliance Certificate Review Period"), the Acting
Holders may deliver to Parent and the Rights Agent a written objection notice
to such Non-Compliance Certificate (an "Objection Notice") and retain the
Independent Accountant to verify the accuracy of the Net Sales during the
Milestone Achievement Period. If the Acting Holders elect to deliver an
Objection Notice, they shall appoint one Holder (the "Holder Representative")
to represent them with respect to the review of the Independent Accountant.
Upon the written request to Parent by the Holder Representative, Parent shall
permit the Independent Accountant, at the Acting Holders' expense, to have
access upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours to such of the
records of the Company or other applicable Selling Entity as are reasonably
necessary to verify the accuracy of the Net Sales during the Milestone
Achievement Period. Each Person seeking to receive information from Parent in
connection with an audit shall enter into, and shall cause its accounting firm
to enter into, a reasonable and mutually satisfactory confidentiality
agreement with Parent obligating such party to retain all such financial and
other information disclosed to such party in confidence pursuant to such
confidentiality agreement. The Independent Accountant shall provide Parent
with a copy of all disclosures made to the Holder Representative. No later
than thirty (30) days following access to such records of Parent as are
reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of the Net Sales, the Independent
Accountant shall deliver a written report to Parent and the Holder
Representative of its preliminary findings regarding the Net Sales during the
Milestone Achievement Period and any potentially applicable Milestone Payments
(the "Preliminary Statement"). Parent and the Holder Representative shall have
thirty (30) days following receipt of the Preliminary Statement from the
Independent Accountant (the "Preliminary Statement Review Period") to review
and comment upon the Preliminary Statement. The Independent Accountant shall
take into consideration in good faith any comments received from Parent or the
Holder Representative during the Preliminary Statement Review Period. No later
than ten (10) Business Days after the expiration of the Preliminary Statement
Review Period, the Independent Accountant shall deliver a final written report
to Parent and the Holder Representative (the "Final Statement"). If the
Independent Accountant in the Final Statement concludes that the Holders are
entitled to one or more Milestone Payments (and such payment has not been made
by Parent), then no later than ten (10) days following its receipt of the
Final Statement, Parent shall deliver an amount in cash to the Rights Agent
sufficient to pay to the Holders such Milestone Payment(s), together with
interest at the "prime rate" as published in the Wall Street Journal from time
to time, from the date that the applicable Milestone Payment was due. The
Final Statement shall be final, conclusive and binding on Parent and the
Holders, shall be nonappealable and shall not be subject to further review,
absent manifest error. If the Rights Agent has not received a written
objection to a Non-Compliance Certificate within the Non-Compliance
Certificate Review Period, the Milestone Payment(s) to which the Non-
Compliance Certificate relates shall not be due and payable to the Holders,
and Parent and the Rights Agent shall have no further obligations with respect
to the Milestone Payment(s) to which the Non-Compliance Certificate relates.

  

  

 

7  

  

(g) _Payments to Holders_. With respect to any Milestone Payment that is
payable pursuant to this Agreement, the Rights Agent shall pay the applicable
amount to each of the Holders (the amount to which each Holder is entitled to
receive will be based on the number of CVRs held by such Holder as reflected
on the CVR Register) by (i) check mailed to the address of each Holder as
reflected on the CVR Register as of the close of business on the last Business
Day prior to such payment date or (ii) with respect to Holders that are due
amounts in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate who have provided Parent with
wire transfer instructions in writing, the Rights Agent will make payments by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified in the
written instructions of Parent. Parent shall cause the Rights Agent, on behalf
of and at the expense of Parent, to mail with (or, in the case of payments
made to Holders who have provided Parent with wire instructions, at the same
time as) each payment made a copy of each compliance certificate (whether the
Milestone 1 Compliance Certificate, the Full Milestone 2 Compliance
Certificate or the Partial Milestone 2 Compliance Certificate) to which such
payment relates.

  

  

 

8  

  

(h) _Withholdings_. Parent, the Company and the Rights Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted or withheld, from any amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of
state or local tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or paid
over to or deposited with the relevant governmental entity, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

  


 

  

(i) _Investment of Funds_. The Rights Agent shall invest any cash held by it
for payment to the Holders in a [Custodial Account] or as reasonably directed
by Parent in writing. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall promptly be paid to Parent or an Affiliate of Parent, as
directed by Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent
shall be responsible for providing the Rights Agent with sufficient funds to
satisfy its payment obligations to Holders.

  


 

  

(j) _Treatment of Undistributed Funds_. Any cash that remains undistributed to
the Holders of CVRs twelve (12) months after such payment is due in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand
and shall be held in trust by Parent in a segregated account for the benefit
of the Holders. Any Holders of CVRs who have not theretofore received cash
with respect to such CVRs shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of
their claim therefor. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement,
any portion of the cash provided by Parent to the Rights Agent that remains
unclaimed after termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section
6.13_ (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any governmental entity)
shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of Parent free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  


 

  

(k) The Rights Agent shall keep copies of this Agreement available for
inspection by the Holders during normal business hours at its office. Parent
shall supply the Rights Agent from time to time with such numbers of copies of
this Agreement as the Rights Agent may request.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.5 _No Voting, Dividends or Interest; No Equity or Ownership
Interest_.

  


 

  

(a) CVRs shall not have any voting or dividend rights, and, except as set
forth in this Agreement, interest shall not accrue on any amounts payable in
respect of CVRs.

  


 

  

(b) CVRs shall not represent any equity or ownership interest in Parent, any
constituent company to the Merger or any of their respective Affiliates.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.6 _Ability to Abandon CVRs_. A Holder may at any time, at such
Holder's option, abandon all of such Holder's remaining rights in a CVR by
transferring such CVR to Parent without consideration therefor. Nothing in
this Agreement shall prohibit Parent or any of its Affiliates from offering to
acquire or acquiring any CVRs for consideration from the Holders, in private
transactions or otherwise, in its sole discretion. Any CVRs acquired by Parent
or any of its Affiliates shall be automatically deemed extinguished and no
longer outstanding for purposes of the definition of Acting Holders, _Article
V_ and _Section 6.4_.

ARTICLE III

  


 

  

 _THE RIGHTS AGENT_

  


 

  

SECTION 3.1 _Certain Duties and Responsibilities of the Rights Agent_.

  


 

  

(a) The Rights Agent shall not have any liability for any actions taken or not

arises as a result of the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of
the Rights Agent.

Holders in enforcing any of their rights hereunder. All rights of action of

holders of Shares, be registered in the names and addresses of the holder as
set forth in the applicable letter of transmittal accompanying the Shares
surrendered by the holder thereof in connection with the Offer or the Merger
pursuant to the Merger Agreement and in a denomination equal to the number of

SECTION 4.2 _Efforts_.

  


 

  

(a) Parent shall procure that during the period from and after the Closing

the business of the Company in good faith, consistent with Parent's general
business practices, and shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to sell
the Ophthalmology Products and achieve the Milestone 1 Target and the
Milestone 2 Target, and shall not act in bad faith or take any action with the
purpose of reducing Net Sales or any Milestone Payments hereunder. For

life as the Ophthalmology Products, taking into account all relevant factors,
including as appropriate, any of the devices' commercial profile (taking into
account the devices' features and selling points), competitiveness of
alternative products in the marketplace or under development, the proprietary
position of the devices (taking into account how customers view the Company's
devices as compared to similar devices), the actual or projected profitability
of the devices, the regulatory environment and other technical, commercial,
legal, scientific and/or medical factors. "Commercially reasonable efforts"
shall not include, and nothing herein shall require Parent or the Company to,
accelerate the timing of any sales or when the revenues from such sales would
be booked (in each case as compared to the timing that would otherwise occur
in the ordinary course of business) or provide rebates, returns, charge-backs,
discounts or reductions outside the ordinary course of business in each case
in order to increase Net Sales, sell the Ophthalmology Products and/or achieve
the Milestone 1 Target and the Milestone 2 Target.

  


 

  

(b) Parent shall impose the foregoing obligations set forth in this _Section
4.2(b)_ on each Selling Entity as applicable to such entity and as required
for Parent to satisfy its obligations hereunder.

SECTION 6.2 _Notice to Holders_. All notices, requests and communications
required to be given to the Holders shall be given (unless otherwise herein
expressly provided) in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to
each Holder affected by such event, at his, her or its address set forth in
the CVR Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the
earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where
notice to the Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such
notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall
affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Tender
Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the exhibits
hereto or thereto, the Company Disclosure Letter and the other documents and
certificates delivered pursuant to the Merger Agreement constitute the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among or between any of the parties with respect to the subject
matter of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as between the Rights
Agent, on the one hand, and any Holder or Parent or any other person or
entity, on the other hand, this Agreement alone constitutes the entire
understanding and agreement of such parties with respect to the subject matter
of this Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.4 _Successors and Assigns_. Parent may assign, in its sole
discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more its Affiliates
(that are wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiaries of Parent) (each, an
"Assignee") and any such Assignee may thereafter assign, in its sole
discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations set forth hereunder to one or more
additional Assignees; _provided_ , _however_ , that in connection with any
assignment to an Assignee, Parent shall agree to remain liable for the
performance by Parent of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall be
binding upon, and shall be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of,
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. The Rights
Agent may not assign this Agreement without Parent's consent. Except as
otherwise permitted herein, Parent may not assign this Agreement without the
prior written consent of the Holders of not less than a majority of the
outstanding CVRs. Any attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of such
rights in violation of this _Section 6.4_ shall be void ab initio and of no
effect.

  

  

 

15  

  

SECTION 6.5 _Benefits of Agreement_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, shall give to any Person (other than the parties hereto, the Holders
and their permitted successors and assigns hereunder) any benefit or any legal
or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Agreement or under any covenant
or provision herein contained, all such covenants and provisions being for the
sole benefit of the parties hereto, the Holders and their permitted successors
and assigns. The Holders shall have no rights hereunder except as are
expressly set forth herein.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.6 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED IN ALL RESPECTS,
INCLUDING VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND EFFECT, BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS EXECUTED AND TO BE PERFORMED WHOLLY WITHIN
SUCH STATE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CHOICE OF LAW PRINCIPLES OF SUCH STATE
THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.7 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Venue_. Each of the
parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of
any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court
for the purpose of any action or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or
any of the Transactions, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat
such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, (c) consents to the service of process by first class certified mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the address at which such party
is to receive notice in accordance with _Section 6.1_ and (d) agrees that it
will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions in any court other than a federal court located in the State of
Delaware or a Delaware state court, and irrevocably and unconditionally waives
(and agrees not to plead or claim) any objection to the laying of venue of any
action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions
in a federal court located in the State of Delaware or a Delaware state court
or that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.8 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY
OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
OF THIS AGREEMENT.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.9 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
the parties hereto will, from time to time, do all acts and things and execute
and deliver all such further documents and instruments, as the other parties
hereto may reasonably require to effectively carry out or better evidence or
perfect the full intent and meaning of this Agreement.

  

  

 

16  

  

SECTION 6.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect, insofar as the foregoing can be
accomplished without materially affecting the economic benefits anticipated by
the parties to this Agreement. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.11 _Headings_. The headings and table of contents contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.13 _Termination_. This Agreement shall be terminated and of no force
or effect, and the parties hereto shall have no liability hereunder (other
than to the extent of any obligations which expressly survive or provide for
performance following termination), upon the earliest to occur of (a) the
payment of the Milestone 1 Payment and either (i) the Full Milestone 2 Payment
or (ii) the Partial Milestone 2 Payment, (b) if Parent delivers a Non-
Compliance Certificate and the Acting Holders fail to deliver a written
objection within the Non-Compliance Certificate Review Period, upon the
expiration of the Non-Compliance Certificate Review Period, (c) if Parent
delivers a Non-Compliance Certificate, and the Acting Holders deliver an
objection within the Non-Compliance Certificate Review Period, upon delivery
of a Final Report that determines that no Milestone Payment referenced in the
Non-Compliance Certificate is owed by Parent to the Holders and (d) if Parent
delivers a Non-Compliance Certificate, and the Acting Holders deliver an
objection within the Non-Compliance Certificate Review Period, upon payment by
the Rights Agent to the Holders of all Milestone Payments which the Final
Statement determines are payable by Parent.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.14 _Legal Holidays_. In the event that the day on which any
Milestone Payment is due shall not be a Business Day, then, notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any payment required to be
made in respect of the CVRs on or prior to such date need not be made on or
prior to such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with
the same force and effect as if made on the last day on which such Milestone
Payment is due.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.15 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein"
and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings
when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant
hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this
Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such
terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of
such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein
or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such
agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver
or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor
statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments
incorporated therein. References to a Person are also to its permitted
successors and assigns. References to clauses without a cross-reference to a
Section or subsection are references to clauses within the same Section or, if
more specific, subsection. References from or through any date shall mean,
unless otherwise specified, from and including or through and including,
respectively. The symbol "$" refers to United States Dollars.
