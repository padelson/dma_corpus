ARTICLE II.   THE MERGER   Section 2.1. Structure of the Merger.   (a)
At the Effective Time (as defined below), subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, Acquisition Sub will
merge with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving company
in the Merger (the "Surviving Company"), pursuant to the provisions of, and
with the effect provided in, the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
"DGCL"). The Merger shall be effected by the filing in the office of the
Secretary of State of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary") of a certificate of
merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in accordance with the DGCL. The
separate corporate existence of Acquisition Sub shall thereupon cease. The
name of the Surviving Company shall be Bank Plus Corporation.   (b) At the
Effective Time, (i) the charter of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended
to read as set forth on Exhibit A to the Certificate of Merger and (ii) the
bylaws of Acquisition Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall become the bylaws of the Surviving Company.   (c) At the Effective
Time, the directors and officers of Acquisition Sub shall become the
directors and officers of the Surviving Company.   Section 2.2. Merger
Consideration.   (a) By virtue of the Merger, automatically and without any
action on the part of the Stockholders (as defined below), (i) each share of
Company Common Stock (as defined below) issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares as to which dissenters\'
rights are perfected under Section 262 of the DGCL and any shares of Company
Common Stock that are owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Company) shall become and be converted into the right
to receive, in immediately available funds, the Per Share Merger
Consideration (as defined below), (ii) each share of common stock of
Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall become and be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Company and (iii) each share of Company Common Stock owned by the
Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
shall be retired and canceled and no cash or other consideration shall be
issued with respect thereto. For purposes of Section 2.2, "Per Share Merger
Consideration" shall equal the sum of Seven Dollars and Twenty-Five Cents
($7.25) subject to increase pursuant to the last sentence of Section
7.1(g).   3    (b) Buyer will deposit the sum of $5,000,000 (together
with the additional sums that Buyer deposits pursuant to Section 7.1(g) and
interest accrued or other earnings thereon, the "Escrowed Funds") with an
escrow agent reasonably acceptable to Buyer and the Company (the "Escrow
Agent") into an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") on or before three (3)
business days after the date of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 2.2(b) subject to such changes as
the Escrow Agent may reasonably request (the "Escrow Agreement"). The amount
of the Escrowed Funds shall be delivered to the Paying Agent three (3)
business days before the Effective Time unless previously paid to the Company
pursuant to Section 7.1(g) of this Agreement.   Section 2.3. Payment and
Exchange Procedures.   (a) At and after the Effective Time, each certificate
(each a "Certificate") previously representing shares of Company Common Stock
(other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares (as defined below))
shall represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration
in respect of the number of shares represented by such certificate.   (b)
As of the Effective Time, Buyer shall have deposited, or caused to
be deposited, with American Stock Transfer and Company (the "Paying Agent") (i)
for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
("Stockholders"), for payment in accordance with this Section 2.3, the Per
Share Merger Consideration multiplied by the total number of outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) for the benefit of holders of Options
("Optionholders"), for payment in accordance with Section 2.5, the aggregate
Option Consideration (together with the amount described in (i) , the "Merger
Consideration"). The amount of the Escrowed Funds delivered by the Escrow
Agent to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(b) shall be deemed
deposited by the Buyer with the Paying Agent under this Section 2.3(b).  
(c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event
within three business days following the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause
the Paying Agent to:   (i) mail to each holder of record of a Certificate
or Certificates the  following: (A) a letter of transmittal specifying that
delivery shall be  effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only  upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent,
which shall be in a  form and contain any other reasonable provisions as
Buyer may determine;  and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates  in exchange for the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration. Upon  the proper surrender of a Certificate to the Paying
Agent, together with a  properly completed and duly executed letter of
transmittal, the holder of  such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the  portion of the Merger Consideration which such holder
has the right to  receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant
to the  provisions hereof and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be  cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of any shares of
Company  Common Stock not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
the  applicable portion of the Merger Consideration may be issued to the 
transferee if the Certificate representing such Company Common Stock is 
presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by documents sufficient, in the 
reasonable discretion of Buyer and the Paying Agent, (1) to evidence and 
effect such transfer and (2) to evidence that all applicable stock transfer 
taxes have been paid; and   (ii) deliver to each Optionholder listed on a
schedule to be provided by  the Company to Buyer and the Paying Agent on or
before the Effective Time  the Option Consideration set forth next to such
Optionholder\'s name on such  schedule in accordance with Section 2.5,
against such documents as the  Company may reasonably determine.   (d) From
and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer records of the Company of any shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, certificates are presented to Buyer or the Surviving
Company, such Certificates shall be canceled and exchanged for the portion of
the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section
2.3.   4    (e) Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration that
remains unclaimed for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered by
the Paying Agent to Buyer. Any Stockholders or Optionholders who have not
theretofore complied with this Section 2.3 shall thereafter look only to
Buyer for payment of their Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of
each share of Company Common Stock or Option held by such person as
determined pursuant to this Agreement. If outstanding Certificates are not
surrendered or payments hereunder not claimed prior to the date on which such
payments would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent
permitted by abandoned property and any other Applicable Law (as defined
below), become the property of Buyer (and to the extent not in its possession
shall be paid over to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person (as defined below) previously entitled to such claims. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, none of
Buyer, the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any former Stockholder or Optionholder for any amount delivered to
a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws.   (f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
amount as the Paying Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the portion of the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.   (g) Buyer or the Surviving Company
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the portion of the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Stockholder
or Optionholder such amounts as Buyer or the Surviving Company is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law.   (h) The Per Share Merger Consideration
shall be adjusted proportionately for any stock splits, stock dividends,
subdivisions, reclassifications or any other combinations, divisions or
similar change in the Company\'s capitalization after the date hereof and
which occurs or which has a record date prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger. If shares of Company Common Stock are issued pursuant to the Rights
Agreement, then (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be adjusted as
follows: the sum of: (A) the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration payable
in respect of all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to such issuances plus (B) the amount of any monetary consideration
received by the Company in respect of such issuances, shall be divided by the
number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding after such issuances to
arrive at the adjusted Per Share Merger Consideration, and (ii) the Option
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted by the number of shares of
Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of all Options after giving
effect to the issuance of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Rights Agreement (such that each Optionholder shall receive not less than
what such Optionholder would have received prior to the issuance of such
shares pursuant to the Rights Agreement).   Section 4. The Closing. Upon
satisfaction or satisfactory waiver of all conditions set forth in Article VI
of this Agreement, the closing (the "Closing"of the Merger shall take place
at the offices of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher, 333 South Grand Avenue, Los
Angeles, California 90071 at 9:00 a.m. on the Effective Date, or such other
place, time and date as Buyer and the Company may mutually agree (the
"Closing Date").   Section 2.5. Stock Options. The Company shall take
appropriate action such that at the Effective Time each option, warrant or
other right granted pursuant to the Company\'s Stock Option and Equity
Incentive Plan (the "Company Stock Plan") that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Options") shall be canceled by the
Company in consideration of the right to receive payment pursuant to Section
2.3(c)(ii) by each such Optionholder of an aggregate amount in cash equal to
the positive difference, if any, of (a) the product of (i) the Per Share
Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock as to which such Option is exercisable, minus (b) the aggregate
exercise price of   5   such Option (such positive difference, the
"Option Consideration"). The foregoing calculation shall be made
independently for each agreement granting an Option and, to the extent that
the exercise price of any Option is greater than the Per Share Merger
Consideration, the Option Consideration payable on account of another Option
agreement shall not be offset thereby. At the Effective Time, each Option and
the Company Stock Plan shall terminate and be of no further force or effect,
and any rights thereunder to purchase shares of Company Common Stock shall
also terminate and be of no further force or effect.   Section 2.6.
Conversion of Shares of Dissenting Common Stock. The Company shall give Buyer
prompt notice upon receipt by the Company of any written demands for
appraisal rights, withdrawal of such demands and any other documents received
or instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and shall give
Buyer the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands. The Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with
respect to such demands for appraisal rights and shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Buyer, settle or offer to settle such demands. If
any holders of shares of Company Common Stock dissent from the Merger and
exercise and perfect the right to obtain valuation of and payment for their
shares of Company Common Stock (the "Dissenting Shares") under the provisions
of said Section, then (a) the Dissenting Shares will be deemed for all
purposes to have been retired and canceled automatically immediately prior to
the consummation of the Merger, with the effect that such shares will not
be exchanged for the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof and
(b) all payments to be made to the holders of such Dissenting Shares will be
made directly by Buyer.   ARTICLE III.   CONDUCT PENDING THE MERGER  
Section 3.1. Conduct of the Company\'s Business Prior to the Effective Time.
During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, and

perform its material contractual obligations and not become in  material
default on any such obligations, except where the failure to  perform such
obligations or where being in such default would not have a  Material Adverse
Effect on the Company;    6    (vi) maintain its assets and properties
in good condition and repair,  except for normal wear and tear and for
changes in the ordinary course of  business, consistent with past
practice;   (vii) promptly notify Buyer regarding receipt from any tax

available to Buyer monthly unaudited consolidated balance  sheets and
consolidated income statements of the Company within twenty-five  (25) days
after the close of each calendar month.   As used in this Agreement, the
word "subsidiary" when used with respect to any party means any corporation,
partnership or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated,
which is consolidated with such party for financial reporting purposes.
Unless the context otherwise so requires, any reference to the subsidiaries
of the Company is deemed to include the Bank and its subsidiaries.  
Section 3.2. Forbearance by the Company. During the period from the date
of this Agreement to the Effective Time, and except as (a) contemplated by
this Agreement, (b) required by Applicable Law, (c) necessary to be
consistent with prudent banking practice or (d) set forth in Section 3.2 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall not, and shall not permit
any of its subsidiaries to, without the prior written consent of Buyer (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and shall in any event
be deemed to have been given if, within five (5) business days (or in the
case of Section 3.2(ix) below, two (2) business days) after receipt by Buyer
of a written notice from the Company of the Company\'s intention to act
contrary to any one of the covenants set forth in this Section 3.2, Buyer
shall not have given written notice to the Company of Buyer\'s objection to
such action), do any of the following:   (i) other than in the ordinary

the  aggregate, for employees ranking below the rank of Executive Vice 
President), or create or institute, or make any payments pursuant to, any 
severance plan, bonus plan, incentive compensation plan or package, or pay

of any such amendment as permitted under such Applicable Law);   (v) other
than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past  practice, make
any investment either by purchase of stock or securities,  contributions to
capital, property transfers or purchase of any property or  assets of any

warranties contained in Section 4.2 or 4.3 or to one or more of its covenants
contained in Article III or V; provided, that the mere inclusion of an item

shall (unless otherwise indicated) also be deemed to be disclosed with
respect to any other provision of this Agreement to the extent necessary to

party hereto and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) is material and
adverse to the ability of the relevant party to consummate the Merger or to
perform its material obligations hereunder; provided, however, that a

Section 4.2. Representations and Warranties of the Company. Subject
to Section 4.1 and except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the Company hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:   (a)
Organization and Standing. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware and is registered as a savings and loan holding company under the
Home Owners Loan Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable regulations
thereunder ("HOLA"). The Bank is a federal savings bank duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the United States and
is authorized by the OTS to conduct a federal savings bank business. The Bank
is a member in good standing of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco.
Each of the Company\'s subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. The
Certificate of Incorporation, Articles of Incorporation or Federal Stock
Charter, as applicable, and bylaws of each of the Company and its
subsidiaries, all as amended to date, are in full force and effect. The
Bank\'s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(the "FDIC") in the manner and to the fullest extent provided by law. Neither
the scope of the business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, nor the
location of any of their respective properties requires that the Company or
any of its subsidiaries be qualified or licensed to do business in any
jurisdiction other than the States of California and Minnesota where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed would, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Company Stock. As of
the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of the Company consists solely
of (i) 78,500,000 shares of the Company\'s common stock, par value $0.01 per
share ("Company Common   10   Stock"), of which 19,476,696 shares are
outstanding, and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of the Company\'s preferred stock,
par value $0.01 per share ("Company Preferred Stock," and together with
Company Common Stock, "Company Stock"), of which none are outstanding. Up to
an additional 1,783,000 shares of Company Common Stock may be issued upon
exercise or conversion of outstanding Rights (as defined below). As of the
date hereof, no shares of Company Common Stock and no shares of Company
Preferred Stock were held in treasury by the Company or otherwise owned by
the Company or its subsidiaries. The outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable (subject
to statutory obligations of holders, if any) and subject to no preemptive
rights. Section 4.2(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as
of the date hereof, all shares of Company Stock reserved for issuance,
outstanding options, calls or commitments relating to shares of Company Stock
or any outstanding securities, obligations or agreements convertible into or
exchangeable for, or giving any Person any right (including, without
limitation, preemptive rights) to subscribe for or acquire, any shares of
Company Stock (collectively, "Rights").   (c) Subsidiaries.   (i) (A)
Section 4.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a  complete list
of all of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of the  Company, together with
the jurisdiction of organization of each such  subsidiary, the authorized
shares of capital stock, and the number of  shares of capital stock
outstanding, and, to the extent owned by the  Company or one of its
subsidiaries, what entity owns such stock; (B) the  Company owns, directly or
indirectly, all the issued and outstanding  securities of each of its
subsidiaries; (C) no equity securities of any of  its subsidiaries are or may
become required to be issued (other than to the  Company or its subsidiaries)
by reason of any option, call, commitment,  convertible security or
otherwise; (D) there are no contracts, commitments,  understandings, or
arrangements relating to rights of the Company or any of  its subsidiaries to
vote or to dispose of such securities; and (E) all the  securities of each
subsidiary held by the Company or its subsidiaries have  been validly issued
and are fully paid and nonassessable (subject to  statutory obligations of
holders, if any) and are owned by the Company or  its subsidiaries free and
clear of any charge, mortgage, pledge, security  interest, restriction,
claim, lien, or encumbrance (excluding restrictions  imposed by Applicable
Law) (collectively, "Liens"). Each subsidiary is an  investment permitted
pursuant to HOLA for a unitary savings and loan  holding company and, for
those subsidiaries owned by the Bank, for a  federal savings association or
its subsidiaries.   (ii) The Company does not own, beneficially, directly or
indirectly, any  equity securities or similar interests of any Person (other
than in a  fiduciary capacity or in connection with the foreclosure of
security  interests or as a result of similar enforcement remedies in
connection with  loans made in the ordinary course of business), or any
interest in a  partnership or joint venture of any kind, other than in its
subsidiaries.  Except for its ownership of the Bank, the Company does not own
any stock or  equity interest in any depository institution (as defined in 12
U.S.C.  (S)1813(c)(1)).   (d) Powers. The Company and each of its
subsidiaries has the corporate or trust power and authority to carry on their
respective businesses as they are now being conducted and to own all their
properties and assets. The Company has the corporate power and authority to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.   (e) Corporate Authority.
Subject to receipt of the requisite approval of the Merger and this Agreement
by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company Common
Stock entitled to vote thereon (which are the only stockholder votes required
thereon with respect to the Company), this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action of the Company on or prior to the date hereof. This Agreement is, and
the Certificate of Merger will be, upon due execution and delivery by the
respective parties thereto, valid and legally binding obligations of the
Company, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors\' rights or by
general equity principles. The Company\'s Board of Directors (the "Company
Board") has directed that this Agreement and the transactions hereby be
submitted to the Stockholders for approval (within the meaning of Section 251
of the DGCL) at a meeting of such Stockholders. The Company   11   Board
has received the written opinion of Sandler O\'Neill to the effect that, as
of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration is fair to the holders
of Company Common Stock from a financial point of view (the "Fairness
Opinion").   (f) Approvals; No Defaults.   (i) No consents or approvals
of, or filings or registrations with, any  Governmental Authority are
required to be made or obtained by the Company  or any of its subsidiaries in
connection with the execution, delivery or  performance by the Company of
this Agreement or to consummate the Merger,  except for (A) filings and
approvals of applications with and by the OTS,  the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD"), the  Department of Justice (the
"DOJ"), the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal  Trade Commission (the
"FTC"and the FDIC, (B) filings with the Securities  and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") and state securities authorities, and  (C) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary  pursuant to the DGCL.  
(ii) Subject to receipt of the regulatory approvals referred to in the 
preceding paragraph, expiration of related waiting periods and required 
filings under federal and state securities laws, the execution, delivery  and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions 
contemplated hereby do not and will not (A) constitute a breach or  violation
of, or a default under, or give rise to any Lien, any  acceleration of
remedies or any right of termination or cancellation under,  any law, rule or
regulation or any judgment, decree, writ, injunction,  statute, order,
governmental permit or license, or note, bond, mortgage,  agreement,
indenture or instrument of the Company or any of its  subsidiaries or to
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries or  properties or assets is
subject or bound, (B) constitute a breach or  violation of, or a default
under, the Company\'s or the Bank\'s charter or  bylaws or (C) require any
consent or approval under any such law, rule,  regulation, judgment, decree,
writ, injunction, statute, order,  governmental permit or license, note,
bond, mortgage, agreement, indenture  or instrument, except in each case, for
such matters as would not  constitute a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. To the knowledge of  the Company, there is no reason (specific to
the Company or any of its  subsidiaries) that may cause any Governmental
Authority to deny or withhold  any consent or approval required to be
obtained in connection with the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including but not limited to,  the Merger, other than such matters, if any,
as have been disclosed in the  Company Disclosure Schedule or in the Company
SEC Filings (as defined  below) filed between December 31, 2000 and the date
hereof.   (g) Financial Reports and SEC Documents.   (i) The Company and
its subsidiaries have filed all reports, returns,  registrations and

together with any amendments required to be made with  respect thereto, that
were required to be filed with (A) the SEC, (B) the  OTS, (C) the FDIC and
(D) any other applicable Governmental Authority,  including taxing
authorities, except where the failure to file such  reports, returns,
registrations or statements would not constitute a  Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. As of their respective dates, each  of such Company Filings
(1) complied in all material respects with all laws  and regulations enforced
or promulgated by the Governmental Authority with  which it was filed (or was
amended so as to be in compliance promptly  following discovery of any such
noncompliance) and (2) did not contain any  untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact  required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein,  in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.   (ii) Each of the consolidated
balance sheets contained in or  incorporated by reference into any of the
Company Filings (including the  related notes and schedules thereto) fairly
presents the consolidated  financial position of the Company and its
subsidiaries as of its date, and  each of the consolidated statements of
income and changes in stockholders\'  equity and cash flows or equivalent
statements in the Company Filings  (including any related notes and schedules
thereto) fairly presents the  consolidated results of operations, changes in
stockholders\' equity and  changes in cash flows, as the case may be, of the
Company and its  subsidiaries for the periods to which they relate, in each
case in  accordance with GAAP,   12    as applicable, consistently
applied during the periods involved, except in  each case as may be noted
therein, subject to normal year-end audit  adjustments and the lack of
complete footnote disclosure in the case of  unaudited statements.   (iii)
Except as set forth in the Company Filings filed with the SEC (the  "Company
SEC Filings") between December 31, 2000 and the date hereof, since  December

this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,  (B) liabilities
which are not required to be reflected in a balance sheet  prepared in
accordance with GAAP and (C) liabilities that, in the  aggregate, are not

2000 and the date hereof, since December 31, 2000, the Company  and its
subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses in the  ordinary and
usual course consistent with past practice (excluding the  incurrence of
liabilities with respect to expenses and charges related to  this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby) and no event has  occurred or
circumstance arisen that, individually or taken together with  all other
facts, circumstances and events, constitutes a Material Adverse  Effect on
the Company.   (h) Litigation. Except as set forth in the Company SEC
Filings filed between December 31, 2000 and the date hereof, there is no
private or governmental suit, claim, action or proceeding (other than those
arising in the ordinary course of business in connection with loan workouts
or assumptions) pending, nor to the Company\'s knowledge threatened, against
the Company or any of its subsidiaries or, to the Company\'s knowledge,
against any of their respective directors, officers or employees relating to
the performance of their duties in such capacities or against or affecting
any properties of the Company or its subsidiaries that, if adversely
determined, would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as
disclosed in the Company SEC Filings filed between December 31, 2000 and the
date hereof, there are no material judgments, decrees, stipulations or orders
against the Company or its subsidiaries or enjoining any of them or, to the
knowledge of the Company, any of their respective directors, officers or
employees in respect of, or the effect of which is to prohibit, any business
practice or the acquisition of any property or the conduct of business in any
area.   (i) Regulatory Matters.   (i) Except as set forth in the Company
SEC Filings filed between  December 31, 2000 and the date hereof, neither the
Company nor any of its  subsidiaries or properties is a party to or is
subject to any currently  effective order, decree, agreement, memorandum of
understanding or similar  arrangement with, or any currently effective
commitment letter or similar  submission to, or extraordinary supervisory
letter from, any federal or  state governmental agency or authority charged
with the supervision or  regulation of financial institutions or issuers of
securities or engaged in  the insurance of deposits (including, without
limitation, the OTS and the  FDIC) or the supervision or regulation of the
Company or any of its  subsidiaries (collectively, the "Regulatory
Authorities") which would have  a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.  
(ii) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has been advised by  any
Regulatory Authority that such Regulatory Authority is contemplating  issuing
or requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of issuing or 
requesting) any such order, decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding, 
commitment letter, supervisory letter or similar submission.   (j)
Compliance with Laws. The Company and each of its subsidiaries:   (i) is in
compliance with all applicable federal, state, local and  foreign statutes,
laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, orders  or decrees
applicable thereto or to the employees conducting their  respective
businesses ("Applicable Laws"), including, without limitation,  the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community  Reinvestment
Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and all   13    other applicable
fair lending laws and other laws relating to  discriminatory lending or other
business practices, except for any such  non-compliance that, individually or
in the aggregate, do not constitute a  Material Adverse Effect on the
Company;   (ii) has made all filings, applications and registrations with
all  Governmental Authorities that are required in order to permit them to
own  or lease their properties and to conduct their businesses substantially
as  presently conducted, except in each case as does not constitute a
Material  Adverse Effect on the Company; and   (iii) has not received any
outstanding notification or communication  from any federal or state (not
including local) Governmental Authority (A)  asserting that the Company or
any of its subsidiaries is not in compliance  with, or may not be in
compliance with, any Applicable Law that such  federal or state (not
including local) Governmental Authority enforces or  (B) threatening to
revoke any license, franchise, permit, or governmental  authorization (nor,
to the Company\'s knowledge, do any grounds for any of  the foregoing
exist).   (k) Material Contracts; Defaults. Except as set forth in Section
4.2(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and except for those agreements and
other documents filed as exhibits (the "Material Contracts") to the Company
SEC Filings, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to,
bound by or subject to any agreement, contract, arrangement, commitment
or understanding (whether written or oral) (i) that is a "material
contract" within the meaning of Item 601(b)(10) of the SEC\'s Regulation S-K
or (ii) that materially restricts the conduct of business by the Company or
any of its subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is
in default in any material respect under any Material Contract or under any
other contract if such default constitutes a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, and there has not occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or
the giving of notice or both, would constitute such a default.   (l) No
Brokers. No action has been taken by the Company that would give rise to any
valid claim against any party hereto for a brokerage commission, finder\'s
fee or other like payment with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, excluding a fee to be paid to Sandler O\'Neill which fee is
payable solely by the Company.   (m) Employee Benefit Plans.   (i) Section
4.2(m) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true  and complete
list of each employee benefit plan, as defined in Section 3(3)  of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended  ("ERISA") and
each other plan, arrangement and agreement providing employee  benefits
(collectively, the "Plans"), that covers current or former  employees of the
Company or any subsidiary or affiliate and is presently  maintained by the
Company or any subsidiary or any affiliate thereof or by  any trade or
business, whether or not incorporated (an "ERISA Affiliate"),  which together
with the Company would be deemed a "single employer" within  the meaning of
Section 4001 of ERISA. Except as disclosed on Section 4.2(m)  of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, none of the Plans is a "multiemployer  plan," as defined
in Section 3(37) of ERISA. The Company has delivered or  made available to
Buyer: copies of all such Plans; any related trust  agreements, group annuity
contracts, insurance policies or other funding  agreements or arrangements
relating thereto; the most recent determination  letter, if any, from the
Internal Revenue Service with respect to each of  the Plans which is subject
to ERISA ("ERISA Plans"); actuarial valuations,  if applicable, for the most
recent plan year or which such valuations are  available; the current summary
plan descriptions; and the annual  return/report on Form 5500 and summary
annual reports for each of the Plans  for each of the last three years.  
(ii) Except as disclosed on Section 4.2(m) of the Company Disclosure 
Schedule, each of the ERISA Plans is in compliance in all material respects 
with all applicable provisions of law, including the Code and ERISA and 
neither the Company or any ERISA Affiliate currently maintains or sponsors  a
defined benefit pension plan as defined in Section 414(j) of the Code and 
neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained or  sponsored
any such plan that could give rise to a liability against the  Company or any
subsidiary.   14    (iii) Except as disclosed on Section 4.2(m) of the
Company Disclosure  Schedule, the written terms of each of the Plan, and any
related trust  agreement, group annuity contract, insurance policy or other
funding  arrangement are in compliance with all applicable laws in all
material  respects including ERISA, the Code, and the Age Discrimination in 
Employment Act, as applicable, and each of such Plans has been administered 
in substantial compliance with such requirements.   (iv) Except with respect
to income taxes on benefits paid or provided,  no income, excise or other tax
or penalty (federal or state) has been  waived or excused, has been paid or
is owed by any Person (including, but  not limited to, any Plan, any Plan
fiduciary, the Company and ERISA  Affiliates) with respect to the operations
of, or any transactions with  respect to, any Plan. No action has been taken,
nor has there been any  failure to take any action, nor is any action or
failure to take action  contemplated, that would subject any person or entity
to any material  liability for any tax or penalty in connection with any
Plan. No reserve  for any taxes or penalties has been established with
respect to any Plan,  nor has any advice been given to any person with
respect to the need to  establish such a reserve.   (v) There are no (A)
actions, suits, arbitrations or claims (other than  routine claims for
benefits), (B) legal, administrative or other  proceedings or governmental
investigations or audits or (C) complains to or  by any governmental entity,
which are pending, anticipated, or to the  Company\'s best knowledge,
threatened, against the Plans or their assets.   (vi) The present value of
the future cost to the Company and ERISA  Affiliates of post-retirement
medical benefits that the Company or any  ERISA Affiliate is obligated to
provide, calculated on the basis of  actuarial assumptions the Company
considers reasonable estimates of future  experience and which have been
provided to Acquisition, does not exceed the  amount specified in Schedule
2(m)(vi) hereto.   (vii) Neither the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, nor any
of the ERISA  Plans, nor any trust created thereunder, nor any trustee or
administrator  thereof has engaged in a transaction in connection with which
the Company  or any ERISA Affiliate, any of the ERISA Plans, any such trust,
or any  trustee or administrator thereof, or any party dealing with the ERISA
Plans  or any such trust could be subject to either a civil penalty
assessed  pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed
pursuant to  Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any
ERISA  Affiliate is, or, as a result of any actions, omissions, occurrences
or  state or facts existing prior to the Effective Time, may become liable
for  any tax imposed under Section 4978 of the Code.   (n) Labor Matters.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by
any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or
understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is the Company or
any of its subsidiaries the subject of a proceeding asserting that it or any
such subsidiary has committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of
the National Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel the Company or any
such subsidiary to bargain with any labor organization as to wages
or conditions of employment, nor is there any strike or other material
labor dispute or disputes involving it or any of its subsidiaries pending or,
to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened, nor is the Company aware of any
activity involving any employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
seeking to certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging in other
organizational activity.   (o) Rights Agreement. The Company has taken all
action necessary to ensure that the entering into of this Agreement will not
enable or require the Company\'s Rights issued under the Amended and Restated
Rights Agreement, dated as of March 26, 1999, between the Company and
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as Rights Agent (the "Rights
Agreement") to be exercised, distributed or triggered or cause Buyer to
become an "15% Stockholder" (as defined in the Rights Agreement).   (p)
Environmental Matters. To the knowledge of the Company, neither the conduct,
participation in management nor operation by the Company or its subsidiaries
nor any condition of any property presently or previously owned, leased,
managed (including participation in management) or operated by any of them
(including, without limitation, in a fiduciary or agency capacity) violates
or violated in any material respect any   15   applicable local, state
and federal environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including,
without limitation, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, the
Clean Water Act, the Federal Clean Air Act, and the Occupational Safety and

under the laws of the State of Illinois. Each of Buyer and its subsidiaries
is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in the states of the
United States and any foreign jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing of
property or assets or the conduct of its business requires it to be so
qualified, except for such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified, individually or in the aggregate, would not constitute a Material
Adverse Effect on Buyer. Buyer has the corporate power and authority to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.   (b) Corporate Authority.
This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action of Buyer on or prior to the date
hereof. This Agreement is a valid and legally binding obligation of Buyer,

affecting creditors\' rights or by general equity principles.   (c)
Approvals, No Defaults.   (i) No consents or approvals of, or filings or

the Certificate of  Merger with the Delaware Secretary pursuant to the DGCL.
To the knowledge  of Buyer, there is no reason (specific to Buyer,
Acquisition Sub or any  other of Buyer\'s subsidiaries or affiliates) that
may cause any   17    Governmental Authority to deny or withhold any
consent or approval required  to be obtained in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement (other than such matters, if
any, as have been disclosed in  Buyer\'s filings with the SEC between
December 31, 2000 and the date  hereof).   (ii) Subject to receipt of the
regulatory approvals referred to in  Section 4.3(c)(i) and expiration of
related waiting periods, the execution,  delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Buyer and the consummation of  the transactions contemplated
hereby do not and will not (A) constitute a  breach or violation of, or a
default under, or give rise to any Lien, any  acceleration of remedies or any
right of termination or cancellation under,  any law, rule or regulation or
any judgment, decree, writ, injunction,  statute, order, governmental permit
or license, or note, bond, mortgage,  agreement, indenture or instrument of
Buyer or any subsidiary of Buyer, or  to which Buyer or any of Buyer\'s
subsidiaries or any of their respective  properties or assets is subject or
bound, (B) constitute a breach or  violation of, or a default under, the
certificate of incorporation,  charter, bylaws or similar organizational
documents of Buyer or any of  Buyer\'s subsidiaries or (C) require any
consent or approval under any such  law, rule, regulation, judgment, decree,
writ, injunction, statute, order,  governmental permit or license, note,
bond, mortgage, agreement, indenture  or instrument, except in each case for
such matters as would not constitute  a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer.  
(d) Regulatory Matters. Except for such matters as would not constitute
a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer, (i) neither Buyer nor any of its
subsidiaries or properties is a party to or is subject to any order, decree,
agreement, memorandum of understanding or similar agreement with, or a
commitment letter or similar submission to, or extraordinary supervisory
letter from, any federal or state governmental agency or authority charged
with the supervision or regulation of financial institutions or issuers of
securities or engaged in the insurance of deposits (including, without
limitation, the OTS, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC) or the
supervision or regulation of Buyer or any of its subsidiaries (collectively,
the "Buyer Regulatory Authorities"); and (ii) neither Buyer nor any of its
subsidiaries has been advised by any Buyer Regulatory Authority that such
Buyer Regulatory Authority is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is
considering the appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such order,
decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding, commitment letter,

results of operations, changes in  stockholders\' equity and changes in cash
flows of Buyer and its  subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and December 31,
1999 and for the  years then ended, in each case in accordance with GAAP,
consistently  applied during the periods involved, except in each case as may
be noted  therein (collectively, the "Buyer Financial Statements").   (ii)
Except as set forth in the Buyer Financial Statements, since  December 31,
2000, no event has occurred or circumstance arisen that,  individually or
taken together with all other facts, circumstances and  events, constitute a
Material Adverse Effect on Buyer.   (g) No Brokers. No action has been taken
by Buyer that would give rise to any valid claim against any party hereto for
a brokerage commission, finder\'s fee or other like payment with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as set forth in
Section 4.3(g) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule.   18    ARTICLE V.  
COVENANTS   Section 5.1. Acquisition Proposals.   (a) The Company shall
not, directly or indirectly, take any action to: (i) encourage (including by
way of furnishing nonpublic information), solicit, initiate or facilitate any
Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), (ii) enter into any agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) participate in any way in
discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any information to, any Person
in connection with, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or
the making of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal.   (b) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that it is necessary to do so to discharge
properly its fiduciary duties to its Stockholders (as such duties would exist
in the absence of this Section 5.1), or if so required by any Regulatory
Authority, the Company may, in response to an Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board determines in good faith is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal (as defined below), and subject to the Company\'s
compliance with Section 5.1(c), furnish information with respect to the
Company and its subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement the terms of which are no
more favorable to the other party to such confidentiality agreement than the
Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below) and (ii) participate in
discussions with respect to such Acquisition Proposal. It is expressly
understood and agreed that, with respect to the foregoing proviso, the
Company\'s legal and financial advisors shall be able to make inquiries,
and engage in discussions, with any party that has made an Acquisition
Proposal (and such party\'s legal and financial advisors) in order to elicit
information to allow the Company Board to determine in good faith if such
Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a Superior
Proposal.   (c) The Company will, as promptly as practicable, communicate to
Buyer any inquiry received by it relating to any potential Acquisition
Proposal and the material terms of any such proposal or inquiry, including
the identity of the Person and its affiliates making the same, that it may
receive in respect of any such transaction, or of any such information
requested from such Person or of any such negotiations or discussions being
sought to be initiated with such Person.   (d) "Acquisition Proposal" means
any offer or proposal concerning any merger, consolidation or similar
transaction involving, or any purchase of all or any significant portion of
the assets, deposits or any equity securities of, the Company or any of its
subsidiaries; provided, however, that offers, proposals or transaction
relating to acquisitions of currently outstanding equity securities by third
parties representing less than 10% of the voting power of the Company shall
not be deemed Acquisition Proposals. "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal made by a third party which was not solicited by the
Company, its subsidiaries, representatives or other affiliates and which, in
the good faith judgment of the Company Board, taking into account, to the
extent deemed appropriate by the Company Board, the various legal, financial
and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the Person making such proposal
(i) if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated and (ii) if
consummated, is reasonably likely to result in a transaction that is more
favorable to the Stockholders (in their capacity as Stockholders), from a
financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   (e) If the Company Board is prepared to accept a Superior
Proposal, then the Company shall give Buyer 48 hours notice that the Company
is prepared to accept the Superior Proposal; provided that the Company may
not definitively accept a Superior Proposal unless the Company concurrently
therewith terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d) and,
thereafter makes any payment required by Section 7.2(b).   19    Section
5.2. Labor and Employment Matters.   (a) Buyer shall, and shall cause the
Bank to, provide the employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries who
are retained by Buyer or the Bank after the consummation of the Merger with
benefits under stock plans, bonus plans and all other benefit plans of Buyer
on substantially the same basis as other similarly situated employees of
Buyer. Each of these employees of the Company or its subsidiaries will be
eligible to participate immediately in said plans and will be credited for
eligibility, participation, vesting and accrual purposes, with such
employee\'s respective years of past service with the Company (or other prior
service so credited by the Company) as though they had been employees of
Buyer. Buyer shall, and shall cause the Bank to, honor in accordance with
their terms all the employee benefit and deferred compensation obligations to
current and former employees and directors of the Company and the Bank
accrued as of the Effective Time of the Merger. The Company and its ERISA
Affiliates shall (to the extent permissible under the Plans and Applicable
Laws) take any actions necessary or reasonably requested by Buyer to cause as
of the Closing Date, the termination of all of the Plans maintained by the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate that cover employees and directors of
the Company and its ERISA Affiliates; provided, however, that the Company
401(k) Plan shall not be terminated but shall be merged with the Buyer 401(k)
Plan as soon as administratively practicable after the Closing Date. Buyer
also agrees that any pre-existing condition limitation or exclusion or
waiting period in its health plans shall not apply to the employees of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries who are retained after the consummation of
the Merger or to their spouses and dependents who are covered under similar
health plans of the Company and its ERISA Affiliates on the Closing Date and
who change coverage to Buyer\'s health plans at the time such employees are
first given the option to enroll in Buyer\'s health plans and that such
employees shall be given credit for co-payments or deductibles satisfied,
made or incurred prior to Closing Date. With respect to any employee with a
satisfactory work record not covered by an employment contract or change in
control agreement who is retained after the Closing and terminated without
cause within six (6) months after the Closing, Buyer shall assume and provide
the benefits under the Company\'s Personnel Manual regarding "Reduction in
Force (Lay-Off)" and the related "Special Severance and Benefits Program",
with full credit for length of service to the Company and Buyer; provided,
however, that in lieu of providing such benefits, Buyer may, at its sole
option, elect to provide any or all of such employees with a cash payment or,
as applicable, reimbursement of actual costs (in either case, including a
"gross up" for Taxes) in such amount sufficient to allow such employees to
purchase equivalent benefits on an individually negotiated basis.   (b) As
of the Closing, Buyer shall expressly assume any obligation of the Company
and its subsidiaries under the employment, change-in-control and
other agreements listed on Section 5.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule;
provided, however, that to the extent that such agreements provide for post-
termination benefits other than cash, Buyer may, at its sole option, elect to
provide any or all of such employees with a cash payment or reimbursement of
actual costs (in either case, including a "gross up" for Taxes) in such
amount sufficient to allow such employees to purchase equivalent benefits on
an individually negotiated basis.   (c) The Company shall deliver or cause
to be delivered to Buyer at the Closing the resignations of the members of
the Board of Directors of the Company, the Bank and their subsidiaries,
effective at the Closing. In addition, such officers or employees of the
Company listed on Section 5.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (or
otherwise requested by Buyer in writing from time to time prior to the
Closing) will be terminated immediately after the Closing. It is acknowledged
and agreed by Buyer and the Company that the resignations and terminations
provided for in the two prior sentences shall be deemed to be "termination"
following a "change of control," as these terms are defined in any
employment, severance, change-in-control or similar agreement or arrangement
relating to such persons, by the Company without cause for purposes of
determining any termination, retirement, severance, change-in-control
or similar payments or other benefit due to such persons, and Buyer shall
cause all such payments to be paid to such persons at the Closing or
otherwise in accordance with the terms of such agreements or arrangements.
Such officers or employees of the Company listed on Section 5.2(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (or otherwise requested by Buyer in writing from
time to time prior to the Closing) shall not be considered "retained" under
Section 5.2(a) and shall not be entitled to participate in any of Buyer\'s or
its Affiliates\' employee benefit plans and programs, severance arrangements
or other employee benefit arrangements.   20    Section 5.3. Access and
Information. Upon reasonable notice and subject to Applicable Laws relating
to the exchange of information, the Company shall, and shall cause each of
its subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel
and other representatives of Buyer reasonable access, during normal business
hours during the time period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time or date of termination, as applicable, to all its properties, books,
contracts, commitments, records, officers, employees, accountants, counsel
and other representatives and, during such period, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause
its subsidiaries to, make available to Buyer (a) a copy of each report,
schedule and other document filed or received by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state
banking laws (other than reports or documents which the Company is not
permitted to disclose under Applicable Law) and (b) all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as Buyer may reasonably
request; provided that such requested information may be presented in the
format maintained by the Company or its subsidiaries in the ordinary course
of business. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information under this Agreement
where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of
their customers, jeopardize any attorney-client, work product or other
privilege, contravene any law, rule, regulations, order, judgment, decree,
fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement or involve information regarding the rights and obligations of the
Company or the Bank under this Agreement. The parties hereto will use
reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements
under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence
apply. Buyer will hold all such information in confidence in accordance with
the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated April 25, 2001,
between Buyer and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement").   Section

consents, approvals, extensions, waivers and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Authorities which are necessary or advisable
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and complying
with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations.   (b) The Company and Buyer shall have the right to
review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other
on, in each case subject to Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, all the information relating to the Company or Buyer, as the
case may be, and any of their respective subsidiaries, which appear in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree
that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the
other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated herein.   (c) Buyer and the Company shall, upon
request, furnish each other with all information concerning themselves, their
subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy
Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of Buyer or the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries to any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   21    (d) The Company
shall promptly furnish Buyer, and Buyer shall promptly furnish the Company,
with copies of written communications received by the Company or Buyer,
respectively, or any of their respective subsidiaries, affiliates or
associates (as such terms are defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as in effect on the date of this Agreement)
from, or delivered by any of the foregoing to, any Governmental Authority in
respect of the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties hereto and their
subsidiaries shall not be required to provide access to or disclose
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client, work product or other privilege of any party or any subsidiary or
would contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date hereof. The parties will
use reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements
under the circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence
apply.   (e) Buyer covenants that it shall have adequate funds and
sufficient regulatory capital to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.   Section 5.5. Publicity. No press release or other public
disclosure of matters related to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be made by a party hereto unless the other party
shall have provided its prior consent to the form and substance thereof;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit any party
hereto from making any disclosure that its counsel deems necessary or
advisable in order to fulfill such party\'s disclosure obligations imposed by
Applicable Law.   Section 5.6. Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly
prepare a proxy statement for use in connection with the Company\'s meeting
of stockholders described below (including any supplements or amendments
thereto, the "Proxy Statement"), and the Company shall promptly, after final
SEC review thereof and receipt of any other necessary approvals from any
Governmental Authority, mail the Proxy Statement to all holders of record (as

Agreement.   Section 5.8. Notification of Certain Matters.   (a) Default;

to the other of: (i) any notice of, or other communication relating to, a

of such party and its subsidiaries taken as a whole to which such party or
any such subsidiary is a party or is subject; (ii) any Material Adverse
Effect with respect to such party or the occurrence of any event which, so

is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect; and (iii) any
notice or other communication from any third party alleging that the consent
of such third party is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if a failure to obtain such
consent would constitute a Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Material Breach.
Each party shall promptly advise the other (i) of any circumstance or event
that such party believes would, or would be reasonably likely to, cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein and (ii) in the event that it determines that any

Effective Time of the Merger, the reports, registrations, statements and
other filings required to be filed with any applicable Governmental Authority
by the Company or the Bank will comply in all material respects with all the
applicable statutes, rules and regulations enforced or promulgated by the

either circumstance, that the annual premiums for such coverage do not exceed
150% of the annual premiums paid by the Company or the Bank for such coverage
as of the date of this Agreement. To the extent that such annual premiums do
exceed 150% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company or the Bank
for such coverage, Buyer shall use its best efforts to obtain the maximum
amount of such coverage that may be purchased for an annual premium equal to
150% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company or the Bank. The
provision of insurance coverage described herein is not intended to alter or
reduce the right of indemnity in favor of officers, directors, employees and
agents of the Company, the Bank or any of their respective subsidiaries under
their charters, bylaws, indemnification agreements or otherwise. For the
avoidance of doubt: (i) in the event that a tail-end rider is purchased,
Buyer\'s obligation with respect to the total premium therefor shall not
exceed the annual premium currently paid by the Company for the Company DandO;
Insurance multiplied by six (6) and (ii) in the event that Buyer causes the
required coverage to be provided under a Buyer Policy, the 150% limitation
provided in this Section 5.13 applies only with respect to the incremental
cost of adding the Covered Persons.   ARTICLE VI.   CONDITIONS TO

material respects all covenants and agreements required to be performed by it

to their respective material mortgages, notes, leases, franchises,

(except to the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an

This Agreement may (and shall, as provided in Sections 7.1(d) or (g) below)
be terminated, and the Merger abandoned, prior to the Effective Date, either
before or after its approval by the Stockholders:   (a) by the mutual
consent of Buyer and the Company in writing, if the board of directors of
each so determines by vote of a majority of the members of its entire
board;   (b) by Buyer or the Company by written notice to the other party if
either (i) the approval of any Governmental Authority required for the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall have been denied by final unappealable action of such
Governmental Authority or (ii) any Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a final, unappealable order enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;   (c) by Buyer or the Company, if any approval of the
Stockholders required for the consummation of the Merger shall not have been
obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a duly held
meeting of such Stockholders or at any adjournment or postponement
thereof;   (d) concurrently with the acceptance by the Company of a Superior
Proposal;   (e) by Buyer or the Company (provided that the terminating party
is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach
of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement on the part of the other party, which breach is not cured
within thirty (30) days following written notice to the party committing such
breach, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the
Effective Time, unless such breach is waived by the non-breaching party;
provided, however, that neither party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(e) unless the breach, together with
all other such breaches, would entitle the party not to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) (in the
case of a breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by the
Company) or Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) (in the case of a breach of
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by Buyer);   (f) by Buyer
or the Company, if its board of directors so determines by vote of a majority
of the members of its entire board at such time as it becomes apparent that a
condition to such party\'s obligations contained in Article VI hereof will
not be satisfied (unless the failure to satisfy such condition is due to the
breach of any material representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate); or   (g) in
the event that the Merger is not consummated by December 31, 2001 (the
"Termination Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Buyer has not obtained
all Requisite Regulatory Approvals on or before December 31, 2001, but is not
otherwise in breach of this Agreement, the Termination Date shall be extended
to March 31, 2002; provided further, that:   (i) if the Termination Date has
been extended to March 31, 2002 and if  the Merger has not been consummated
by such date solely as a result of the  failure by Buyer to obtain all
Requisite Regulatory   26    Approvals, but Buyer is not otherwise in
breach of this Agreement, and if  Buyer deposits an additional $1,000,000
into the Escrow Account on or  before such date, then Buyer may elect to
extend the Termination Date to  April 30, 2002;   (ii) if the Termination
Date has been extended to April 30, 2002 and if  the Merger has not been
consummated by such date solely as a result of the  failure by Buyer to
obtain all Requisite Regulatory Approvals, but Buyer is  not otherwise in
breach of this Agreement, and if Buyer deposits an  additional $1,000,000
into the Escrow Account on or before such date, then  Buyer may elect to
extend the Termination Date to May 31, 2002; and   (iii) if the Termination
Date has been extended to May 31, 2002 and if  the Merger has not been
consummated by such date solely as a result of the  failure by Buyer to
obtain all Requisite Regulatory Approvals, but Buyer is  not otherwise in
breach of this Agreement, and if Buyer deposits an  additional $1,000,000
into the Escrow Account on or before such date, then  Buyer may elect to
extend the Termination Date to June 30, 2002.  If the Termination Date is
extended pursuant to this Section 7.1(g), Buyer shall pay interest on the
Merger Consideration at an interest rate equal to the prime rate, and the Per
Share Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately.   Section 7.2.
Effect of Breach or Termination. In the event of a breach by any party hereto
(other than a willful breach), the sole and exclusive remedy of the other
party shall be to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1 and
to receive such amounts, if any, as may be payable under Section 7.3. In the
event of the termination of this Agreement as specified in Section 7.1
hereof, this Agreement shall thereafter become void and there shall be no
liability on the part of any party hereto or their respective officers
or directors subject to the following sentence. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) no party shall be relieved
or released from any liabilities or damage arising out of its willful and
material breach of any provisions of this Agreement; (ii) in the case of the
Company, no termination shall release the Company from any liability it may
have to Buyer to the extent provided in Section 7.3; or (iii) any liability
resulting from a breach of Section 5.4(e), which liability shall exist
notwithstanding the failure of any Governmental Authority to grant any
Requisite Regulatory Approval to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby if such Requisite Regulatory Approval would have been
granted but for the inadequacy of Buyer\'s regulatory capital. Except as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence, no party hereto shall have
any liability to any other party under the terms of this Agreement, whether
for breach hereof or otherwise.   Section 7.3. Expenses; Termination
Fee.   (a) The Company hereby agrees that if the Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 7.1(c) or by Buyer pursuant to Section 7.1(e), the
Company shall promptly and in any event within ten (10) days after such
termination pay Buyer all Expenses (as defined below) of Buyer, but not to
exceed $1,500,000.   (b) Buyer hereby agrees that if the Agreement is
terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(e), Buyer shall promptly
and in any event within ten (10) days after termination pay the Company all
Expenses of the Company and the Bank, but not to exceed $1,500,000.   (c)
Except as otherwise provided herein, all Expenses incurred by Buyer and the
Company in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation
and execution of this Agreement, the solicitation of stockholder approvals
and all other matters related to the closing of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including, without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, all
fees and expenses of agents, representatives, counsel and accountants
employed by either such party or its affiliates, shall be borne solely and
entirely by the party which has incurred the same.   (d) "Expenses" of a
party as used in this Agreement shall include all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses (including all fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants,
investment bankers, experts and consultants to such   27   party and its
affiliates) incurred by the party or on its behalf after March 1, 2001 in
connection with the sale of the Company, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.   (e) The Company shall pay to Buyer the sum of
$5,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") payable as provided below solely as
follows: (i) if this Agreement shall have terminated pursuant to Section
7.1(d); or (ii) if all of the following occur: (A) the Company or Buyer shall
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c) and, at the time of such
termination, Buyer is not in breach of this Agreement, (B) at any time after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the meeting of the Stockholders to
vote on the Merger, if any, there shall have been publicly announced a
Superior Proposal and (C) within nine months of the termination of this
Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal.   (f) The Termination Fee required to be paid
pursuant to Section 7.3(e) shall be paid to Buyer not later than five
business days after the Company enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal. All payments under Section 7.3(e) shall be
made in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Buyer; provided, however, that in the event that the Company
determines, in its reasonable discretion, that payment of the full amount of
the Termination Fee in cash will, or is reasonably likely to reduce the
Bank\'s capital for regulatory purposes to a level that would not provide a
reasonable cushion above the amount necessary to remain "well capitalized"
under the Prompt Corrective Action regulations of the OTS, then, it may cause
some or all of the Termination Fee to be paid to Buyer in the form of a
transfer by the Company to Buyer of shares of the Bank Preferred Stock, the
terms of which are set forth on Exhibit 7.3(g) hereto. In the event the
Company determines that such transfer of Bank Preferred Stock is necessary
under this Section 7.3(g), the Company shall, within twenty (20) business
days of the date of termination of this Agreement, transfer such
Bank Preferred Stock. In addition, it is understood that, in the event that
the Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section 7.3(f), the Company and
the Bank shall receive credit for (and the amount payable by them in respect
of the Termination Fee shall be reduced by) the amount of any payments made
by them pursuant to Section 7.3(a).   (g) Upon the termination of this
Agreement due to the failure of Buyer to obtain the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals, Buyer shall forfeit the Escrowed Funds, which shall be delivered
by the Escrow Agent to the Company within five (5) business days after the
date of termination. In addition, it is understood that, in the event that
the Escrowed Funds are forfeited and delivered to the Company pursuant to
this Section 7.3(g), Buyer shall be relieved of its obligation to pay the
Company\'s Expenses under Section 7.3. Payment of the Escrowed Funds to the
Company shall not constitute liquidated damages and Buyer shall remain liable
for damages in accordance with the terms of this Agreement upon Buyer\'s
willful breach of this Agreement notwithstanding the payment of the Escrowed
Funds.   (h) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the last sentence
of Section 5.3 and, in their entirety, Sections 7.2 and 7.3 and Article IX
shall survive any termination of this Agreement.   ARTICLE VIII.  
EFFECTIVE DATE AND EFFECTIVE TIME   Section 8.1. Effective Date and
Effective Time. On such date as the parties may agree, which shall be within
five (5) business days after the last to occur of the expiration of all
applicable waiting periods in connection with the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of all other conditions to the
consummation of this Agreement (other than those conditions relating to the
receipt of officer\'s certificates or fairness opinions), or on such earlier
or later date as may be agreed in writing by the parties, the Certificate of
Merger shall be executed in accordance with all appropriate legal
requirements and shall be filed as required by law, and the Merger provided
for herein shall become effective upon the date and time specified in the
