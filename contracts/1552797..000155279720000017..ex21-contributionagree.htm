however, that (i) the Contributors shall be responsible for their own income
taxes in respect of sale of the Transferred Assets pursuant to the

negotiate in good faith to resolve such Dispute; provided, however, that if
the Contributors and DKL PG are unable to resolve any Dispute with respect to
the Allocation Schedule within 30 days following DKL PG's delivery of the
draft Allocation Schedule, such Dispute shall be resolved by the office of a
mutually agreeable, impartial, nationally recognized firm of independent
certified public accountants appointed by the Contributors and DKL PG. The
fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by the
Contributors and DKL PG. DKL PG and the Contributors shall file all tax
returns (including amended returns and claims for refund) and information
reports in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule. Any adjustments
to the Total Consideration pursuant to this Agreement shall be allocated in a
manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule.

other hand, pays any tax agreed to be borne by the other Party under this
Agreement, such other Party shall promptly reimburse the paying Party for the
amounts so paid following the receipt of notice thereof and reasonable
supporting documentation. If any Party receives any tax refund or credit
applicable to a tax paid by another Party hereunder, the receiving Party shall
promptly pay such amounts to the Party entitled thereto. Any amount payable
pursuant to this Section 3.6 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account specified by DKL PG or a Contributor, as
applicable.

With respect to each Lease:

(i) such Lease is valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect,
and the Contributor party to such Lease enjoys peaceful and undisturbed
possession of the Leased Real Property;

(ii) the Contributor party to such Lease is not in breach or default under
such Lease, and no event has occurred or circumstance exists which, with the
delivery of notice, passage of time or both, would constitute such a breach or
default, and the applicable Contributor party to such Lease has paid all rent
due and payable under such Lease;

(iii) the Contributor party to such Lease has not received nor given any
written notice of any default or event that with notice or lapse of time, or
both, would constitute a default by such Contributor under any of the Leases
and, to the knowledge of such Contributor, no other party is in default
thereof, and no party to any Lease has exercised any termination rights with

(iv) the Contributor party to such Lease has not subleased, assigned or

collectively, the "Owned Real Property"), including with respect to each
property, the address, location and use. The Contributors have delivered to
DKL PG copies of the deeds and other instruments (as recorded) by which the
Contributors acquired such parcel of Owned Real Property, and copies of all

Property (other than Easements): (i) the Contributors have good, valid and defensible fee simple title to such
property by which the Contributors would be reasonably likely to successfully

the ability of the Partnership Parties to own and operate the DPG System
Assets from and after the Closing in the ordinary course of business as
currently conducted by the Contributors. None of the Contributors have
received any written notice of any alleged or threatened default or
termination, under the terms of any Easement that, in each case, would

material portion of any Real Property has been damaged or destroyed by fire or
other casualty. (e) The Real Property and the Easements, together with real property interests
owned by Affiliates of the Partnership Parties, constitute all of the real
property interests necessary to continue to operate the DPG System Assets in
the ordinary course after Closing as currently conducted in all material

defects, gaps and irregularities) as would reasonably be anticipated to exist,
based on industry practices, at a pipeline facility of the size, age, location
and other characteristics of each Contributor's assets.

(f) Except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 4.8(f), (i) all pipelines
included in the Transferred Assets are located on lands subject to the
Easements or on Real Property and (ii) there are no gaps (including any gap
arising as a result of any breach by any Contributor of the terms of any such
Easements or Real Property) in such Easements or Real Property, other than, as
to clause (i) and clause (ii), as could not reasonably be expected to
adversely affect in any material respect the ability of the Partnership
Parties to own and operate the DPG System Assets from and after the Closing in
the ordinary course of business as currently conducted by the Contributors

Material Adverse Effect, Delek Marketing and Supply, LP, a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Partnership ("DKL MandS"), has all Permits necessary for the
ownership, construction, maintenance and operation of the Transferred Assets
at the locations and in the manner operated as of the date hereof. Except

MandS is in compliance with all Permits necessary for the ownership,
construction, maintenance and operation of the Transferred Assets, all such
Permits are in full force and effect, and there is no Action pending before
any Governmental Authority or, to the knowledge of the Contributors,

work contemplated by the purchase orders set forth on Schedule 6.7, the
Transferred Assets, together with the rights granted to DKL PG pursuant to the
Ancillary Documents, constitute all of the assets and rights necessary to own,
construct, maintain and operate the Transferred Assets in a manner consistent
with past practice.

4.11 Compliance with Applicable Law. Except where the failure to be in
compliance would not have a Material Adverse Effect, with respect to the
Transferred Assets, including their construction, maintenance and operation,
the Contributors are and have been in compliance with all, and, to the
knowledge of the Contributors, are not under investigation with respect to and
have not been threatened to be charged with or given notice of any violation
of any, Applicable Laws (other than Environmental Laws which are the subject
of Section 4.12). No event has occurred, and no circumstances exist, that
(with or without the passage of time or the giving of notice) would result in
a violation of, conflict with, or failure on the part of any Contributor to
own and operate the Transferred Assets in material compliance with Applicable Law. The
Contributors have disclosed to DKL PG in writing prior to the execution hereof
all investigations or notices of any material violations of any Applicable

received by the Contributors, their respective Affiliates, or their
predecessors related to the Transferred Assets within the last three years.

4.12 Compliance with Environmental Law. With respect to the ownership,
construction, maintenance and operation of the Transferred Assets, except
where the failure to be in compliance would not have a Material Adverse
Effect, the Contributors are and have been in compliance with all
Environmental Laws and have not received written notice of any investigation
or liability (including obligations under any pending Order) under, or
violation of, any Environmental Laws. To the Contributors' knowledge and
except as would not be reasonably anticipated to have a Material Adverse
Effect, no event has occurred and no circumstances exist that (with or without
the passage of time or the giving of notice) would result in a violation of,
conflict with, or failure on the part of any Contributor to own and operate
the Transferred Assets in compliance with Environmental Law. No Contributor
has released Hazardous Materials in, on or under the Transferred Assets in a
manner that would reasonably to anticipated to have a Material Adverse Effect.

4.13 Transferred Contracts. Each Transferred Contract is valid and binding on
the applicable Contributor party thereto in accordance with its terms and is
in full force and effect. None of such Contributors or, to Contributors'
knowledge, any other party thereto is in breach of or default under (or is
alleged to be in breach of or default under) in any material respect, or has
provided or received any written notice of any intention to terminate, any
Transferred Contract. No event or circumstance has occurred that, with notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute a material event of default under
any Transferred Contract or result in a termination thereof or would cause or
permit the acceleration or other changes of any right or obligation or the
loss of any benefit thereunder. Complete and correct copies of each
Transferred Contract (including all modifications, amendments and supplements
thereto and waivers thereunder) have been made available to DKL PG.

4.14 Taxes. With respect to any federal, state or local taxes (and interest or
penalties with respect to taxes) applicable to the Transferred Assets (or the
owner or operator thereof, to the extent attributable to the Transferred
Assets), all returns, notices or receipts required to be filed with any
Governmental Authority have been timely filed and are true, correct and
complete in all material respects.

(a) Each Contributor has timely paid all material such taxes, interest or
penalties that have become due.

(b) No Governmental Authority has raised any action, suit, proceeding,

extending the applicable statutory periods of limitation concerning the same.

(c) None of the Transferred Assets are treated as co-owned or part of a joint
venture within the meaning of Code Section 761. 4.15 Connection Agreements. Except for such obligations contemplated by

their obligations with respect to the construction of receipt points under the
Transferred Contracts (other than Easements).

New Common Units) is an "accredited investor," as such term is defined in Rule
501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act, and will acquire the New

otherwise has had access to, and has had an opportunity to review, examine and
ask questions relating to, such information regarding the Partnership and its
business that is necessary for it to make an informed decision regarding the
investment in the New Common Units. Delek US Energy (or its designees that
receive the New Common Units) acknowledges that the New Common Units have not
been registered under applicable federal and state securities laws and that
the New Common Units may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged,
hypothecated, or otherwise disposed of unless such transfer, sale, assignment,
pledge, hypothecation, or other disposition is registered under applicable
federal and state securities laws or is made pursuant to an exemption from
registration under any federal or state securities laws.

the current expectations of the Contributors' management regarding the
Transferred Assets.

ARTICLE VI

COVENANTS

6.1 Further Assurances. Each Party shall take such further actions, including
obtaining Consents to assignment from third parties, and execute such further
documents as may be necessary or reasonably requested by the other Party in
order to effectuate the intent of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents
and to provide such other Party with the intended benefits of this Agreement
and the Ancillary Documents. Following the Closing, DKL PG, on the one hand,
and the Contributors, on the other hand, agree to remit to the other Party or
its Affiliates, as applicable, with reasonable promptness, any payments,
rebates, bills or other correspondence received on or in respect of, or
otherwise relevant to the other Party or its Affiliates including, with
respect to DKL PG, the Transferred Assets or, with respect to the
Contributors, the Excluded Assets.

6.2 Tax Matters.

(a) Cooperation. The Parties shall cooperate fully with each other and shall
make available to the other, as reasonably requested and at the expense of the
requesting Party, and to any Governmental Authority responsible for the
administration of any tax, all information, records or documents relating to
tax liabilities or potential tax liabilities of any Contributor or related to
the Transferred Assets for all periods at or prior to the Effective Time and
any information which may be relevant to determining the amount payable under
this Agreement, and shall preserve all such information, records and documents
at least until the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations or
extensions thereof.

(b) Tax Treatment.

(i) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.2(b), the Parties
acknowledge that the transactions described in this Agreement are properly
characterized as transactions described in Sections 721(a) and 731 of the
Code, and agree to file all tax returns in a manner consistent with such
treatment. (ii) The Cash Consideration shall be treated (A) as a "debt-financed transfer"
to Delek US Energy under Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-5(b) to the extent
the cash is traceable under the principles of Treasury Regulations Section
1.163-8T to Delek US Energy's allocable share, determined under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.707-5(b)(2), of indebtedness of the Partnership, (B) as
a reimbursement of Delek US Energy's preformation expenditures with respect to
the Transferred Assets within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.707-4(d) to the extent applicable, and (C) as the proceeds of a sale by
Delek US Energy of the Transferred Assets to the Partnership to the extent
clauses (A) and (B), or any other exceptions to the "disguised sale" rules
under Section 707 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, are inapplicable.

6.3 Cooperation for Litigation and Other Actions. Each Party shall cooperate
reasonably with the other Party, at the requesting Party's expense (but
including only out-of-pocket expenses to unaffiliated third parties,
photocopying and delivery costs and not the costs incurred by any Party for
the wages or other benefits paid to its officers, directors or employees), in
furnishing reasonably available information, testimony and other assistance in
connection with any proceedings, tax audits or other disputes involving any of
the Parties (other than in connection with Disputes between the Parties).

6.4 Retention of and Access to Books and Records.

(a) As promptly as practicable and in any event before 30 days after the
Closing Date, each Contributor will deliver or cause to be delivered to DKL
PG, the Books and Records that are in the possession or control of such
Contributor or its Affiliates.

(b) DKL PG agrees to afford each Contributor and its Affiliates and their
respective accountants, counsel and other designated individuals, during
normal business hours, upon reasonable request, at a mutually agreeable time,
full access to and the right to make copies of the Books and Records (to the
extent relating to the ownership, construction, maintenance and operation of
the Transferred Assets prior to the Effective Time); provided that such access
will not be construed to require the disclosure of such Books and Records that
would cause the waiver of any attorney-client, work product or like privilege;
provided, further, that in the event of any litigation, nothing herein shall
limit any Party's rights of discovery under Applicable Law. Without limiting
the generality of the preceding sentences, DKL PG agrees to provide each
Contributor and its Affiliates reasonable access to and the right to make
copies of the Books and Records (to the extent relating to the ownership,
construction, maintenance and operation of the Transferred Assets prior to the
Effective Time) after the Closing for the purposes of assisting such
Contributor and its Affiliates (i) in complying with such Contributor's
obligations under this Agreement, (ii) in preparing and delivering any
accounting statements provided for under this Agreement and adjusting,
prorating and settling the charges and credits provided for in this Agreement,
(iii) in owning or operating the Excluded Assets, (iv) in preparing tax
returns, (v) in responding to or disputing any tax audit, (vi) in asserting,
defending or otherwise dealing with any Action or Dispute, known or unknown,
under this Agreement or with respect to Excluded Assets or (vii) in asserting,
defending or otherwise dealing with any Third-party Action by or against such
Contributor or its Affiliates relating to the Transferred Assets. (c) The Contributors agree to afford DKL PG and its Affiliates and their
respective accountants, counsel and other designated individuals, during
normal business hours, upon reasonable request, at a mutually agreeable time,
full access to and the right to make copies of the Excluded Books and Records
(to the extent relating to the ownership, construction, maintenance and
operation of the Transferred Assets) at no cost to DKL PG or its Affiliates
(other than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses); provided that such access
will not be construed to require the disclosure of such Excluded Books and
Records that would cause the waiver of any attorney-client, work product or
like privilege; provided, further, that in the event of any litigation,
nothing herein shall limit any Party's rights of discovery under Applicable
Law.

6.5 Delayed Assets.

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) any Transferred
Asset, the assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of which to DKL PG
without a Consent would constitute a breach or other contravention of
Applicable Law or the terms of such Transferred Asset, or (ii) any Transferred
Asset listed on Schedule 4.8(a), the assignment, transfer, conveyance or
delivery of which to DKL PG would be ineffective as a result of required
information being missing from the records of Contributors, in each case to
the extent not otherwise transferred at Closing (a "Delayed Asset"), shall not
be assigned, transferred, conveyed or delivered to DKL PG until such time as
such Consent or required information is obtained, at which time such Delayed
Asset shall be automatically assigned, transferred, conveyed or delivered
without further action on the part of DKL PG or the applicable Contributor
unless expressly provided otherwise herein.

(b) Until such time as such Consent or required information is obtained, (i)
each Party (and its applicable subsidiaries and Affiliates) shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the relevant Consent or required
information; provided, that no Party shall be required to pay any monies or
give any other consideration in order to obtain any such Consents or required
information, (ii) the Contributors shall endeavor to provide DKL PG with the
benefits under each Delayed Asset as if such Delayed Asset had been assigned
to DKL PG (including by means of any subcontracting, sublicensing or
subleasing arrangement), to the extent such is permitted under the applicable
Delayed Assets, (iii) the Contributors shall promptly pay over to DKL PG or
its subsidiaries payments received by the Contributors after the Closing in
respect of all Delayed Assets, and (iv) DKL PG shall be responsible for the
Liabilities of the Contributors with respect to such Delayed Asset to the
extent arising after the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any other provision
in this Agreement to the contrary, following the assignment, transfer,
conveyance and delivery of any Delayed Asset, the applicable Delayed Asset
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as a Transferred Asset.

(c) DKL PG hereby agrees that the failure to obtain any such Consent or
required information referred to in this Section 6.5 or the failure of any
such Delayed Asset to constitute a Transferred Asset or any circumstances
resulting therefrom shall not constitute a breach by the Contributors of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement;
provided, however, that any breach by any Contributor of its covenants in this
Section 6.5 may constitute a breach under this Agreement. Nothing in this
Section 6.5 shall be deemed to constitute an agreement to exclude from the
Transferred Assets any such Delayed Asset. 6.6 Bulk Sales Laws. The Parties waive compliance with the provisions of any
bulk sales, bulk transfer or similar Applicable Laws of any jurisdiction that
may otherwise be applicable with respect to the contribution of any or all of
the Transferred Assets to DKL PG; it being understood that any Liabilities
arising out of the failure of the Contributors to comply with the requirements
and provisions of any bulk sales, bulk transfer or similar Applicable Laws of
any jurisdiction which would not otherwise constitute Assumed Liabilities
shall be treated as Excluded Liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt,
notwithstanding any bulk sales, bulk transfer, or similar Applicable Laws, the
Contributors shall be solely responsible for any taxes arising out of the
ownership, construction, maintenance or operation of the Transferred Assets
prior to the Effective Time as provided in Section 3.4(a).

6.7 Reimbursement of Certain Capital Expenditures. Following the Closing, the
Contributors will reimburse the Partnership Parties, on a dollar-for-dollar
basis, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified
by DKL PG promptly upon (but in any event within 30 days of) receipt of an
invoice therefor, all capital expenditures incurred by the Partnership Parties
or their Affiliates pursuant to the purchase orders set forth on Schedule 6.7
to the extent related to items in connection with the DPG System Assets.

ARTICLE VII

INDEMNIFICATION

7.1 Indemnification of DKL PG and the Contributors. From and after the Closing
and subject to the provisions of this Article VII, (a) the Contributors,
jointly and severally, agree to pay to, reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless
the Partnership Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Partnership
Indemnified Costs and (b) DKL PG agrees to pay to, reimburse, indemnify and
hold harmless the Contributor Indemnified Parties from and against any and all
Contributor Indemnified Costs; provided, that for purposes of this Section
7.1, any breach of each Contributor's or DKL PG's representations and
warranties or failure to comply with any covenant or agreement and the amount
of any Partnership Indemnified Costs or Contributor Indemnified Costs, as
applicable, arising from a breach thereof shall be determined without giving
effect to any qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect. For
the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing indemnification is intended to be in
addition to and not in limitation of any indemnification to which the Parties
may be entitled under the Ancillary Documents.

7.2 Defense of Third-Party Claims. An Indemnified Party shall give prompt
written notice to the Contributors or DKL PG, as applicable (the "Indemnifying
Party"), of the commencement or assertion of any Action by a third party
(collectively, a "Third-party Action") in respect of which such Indemnified
Party seeks indemnification hereunder. Any failure so to notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any Liability
that such Indemnifying Party may have to such Indemnified Party under this
Article VII unless and only to the extent that the failure to give such notice
materially and adversely prejudices the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to assume control of the defense of, settle, or
otherwise dispose of such Third-party Action on such terms as it deems
appropriate; provided, however, that: (a) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at its own expense, to
participate in the defense of such Third-party Action (provided, however, that
the Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable attorneys' fees of the
Indemnified Party if (i) the employment of separate counsel shall have been
authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense
of such Third-party Action, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not have
employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to have
charge of such Third-party Action, (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have
reasonably concluded, upon the advice of counsel, that there may be defenses
available to such Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to
those available to the Indemnifying Party, or (iv) the Indemnified Party's
counsel shall have advised the Indemnified Party in writing, with a copy
delivered to the Indemnifying Party, that there is a material conflict of
interest that could violate applicable standards of professional conduct to
have common counsel);

(b) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written approval of the
Indemnified Party before entering into or making any settlement, compromise,
admission, or acknowledgment of the validity of such Third-party Action or any
Liability in respect thereof if, pursuant to or as a result of such
settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment, injunctive or other
equitable relief would be imposed against the Indemnified Party;

(c) the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnified Party of
a release from all Liability in respect of such Third-party Action; and

(d) the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control (but shall be
entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense of), and the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control over, the defense or
settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment of any Third-party Action
(i) as to which the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense within a
reasonable length of time or (ii) to the extent the Third-party Action seeks
an Order or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party which, if
successful, would materially adversely affect the business, operations,
assets, or financial condition of the Indemnified Party; provided, however,
that the Indemnified Party shall make no settlement, compromise, admission, or
acknowledgment that would give rise to Liability on the part of any
Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of such Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(e) The Parties shall extend reasonable cooperation in connection with the
defense of any Third-party Action pursuant to this Article VII and, in
connection therewith, shall furnish such records, information, and testimony
and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials, and
appeals as may be reasonably requested.

7.3 Direct Claims. In any case in which an Indemnified Party seeks
indemnification hereunder which is not subject to Section 7.2 because no
Third-party Action is involved (a "Direct Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall
notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of any Indemnified Costs which such
Indemnified Party claims are subject to indemnification under the terms
hereof. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.4(a), the failure of
the Indemnified Party to exercise promptness in such notification shall not
amount to a waiver of such claim unless and only to the extent that the resulting delay materially and adversely prejudices the
position of the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim. Such notice by
the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail,
shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Indemnified
Costs that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days after its receipt of such notice to
respond in writing to such Direct Claim. The Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to investigate the matter or
circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what
extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the
Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Party's investigation by
giving such information and assistance (including access to the Indemnified
Party's premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts,
documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional
advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond
within such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have
rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to
pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms
and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

7.4 Limitations. The following provisions of this Section 7.4 shall limit the
indemnification obligations hereunder:

(a) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any Indemnified Costs
pursuant to this Article VII unless a written claim for indemnification in
accordance with Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 is given by the Indemnified Party
to the Indemnifying Party with respect thereto on or before 5:00 p.m.,
Nashville, Tennessee time, on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing
Date; provided, however, that written claims for indemnification (i) for
Indemnified Costs arising out of (x) (A) a breach of any Fundamental
Representations or (B) an Excluded Asset, an Excluded Liability or any Pro-
Rated Item may be made at any time and (y) a breach of the representations and
warranties in Section 4.14 may be made at any time prior to the expiration of
its survival pursuant to Section 9.12 and (ii) for Indemnified Costs arising
out of a breach of any covenant may be made at any time prior to the
performance of such covenant according to its terms.

(b) An Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to pay for any Indemnified
Costs under this Article VII until the amount of all such Indemnified Costs
exceeds, in the aggregate, $698,108, in which event Indemnifying Party shall
pay or be liable for all such Indemnified Costs from the first dollar. The
aggregate liability of an Indemnifying Party under this Article VII shall not
exceed $13,962,150. The limitations in the previous two sentences shall not
apply to Indemnified Costs to the extent such costs arise out of (i) a breach
of any Fundamental Representations, (ii) an Assumed Liability, (iii) an
Excluded Liability or any Pro-Rated Item or (iv) breach of any covenant or
other agreement of the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement.

(c) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, after the Closing Date,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, DKL
PG's and the other Partnership Indemnified Parties' and each Contributor's and
the other Contributor Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to the Indemnified Costs shall be in accordance with, and limited by,
the provisions set forth in this Article VII. The Parties further acknowledge and agree that the foregoing is not the remedy for and does not limit the
Parties' remedies for matters covered by the indemnification provisions
contained in the Ancillary Documents. Any indemnification obligation of any
Contributor to the Partnership Indemnified Parties on the one hand, or DKL PG
to the Contributor Indemnified Parties on the other hand, pursuant to this
Article VII shall be reduced by an amount equal to any indemnification
recovery by such Indemnified Parties pursuant to the other Ancillary Documents
between the Parties to the extent that such other indemnification recovery
arises out of the same event or circumstance giving rise to the
indemnification obligation of the Contributors or DKL PG, respectively,
hereunder.

7.5 Payments. Once an Indemnified Cost is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party
or finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this Article VII, the
Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within 10 Business Days of
such agreement or final adjudication by wire transfer of immediately available
funds. The Parties agree that should an Indemnifying Party not make full
payment of any such obligations within such 10 Business Day period, any amount
payable shall accrue interest from and including the date of agreement of the
Indemnifying Party or final adjudication to and including the date such
payment has been made at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate plus 2%.
Such interest shall be calculated daily on the basis of a 365-day year and the
actual number of days elapsed.

7.6 Tax Related Adjustments. Each Contributor and DKL PG agree that any
payment of Indemnified Costs and any payments pursuant to Section 3.4 and
Section 6.7 made hereunder will be treated by the Parties to the extent
allowed by Applicable Law, on their tax returns as an adjustment to the Total
Consideration.

7.7 Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties, and covenants of
the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification
with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party (including by any
of its representatives) or by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party
knew or should have known that any such representation or warranty is, was or
might be inaccurate.

ARTICLE VIII

LIMITED GUARANTY

8.1 Limited Guaranty by Delek US. Delek US hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees to DKL PG the due and punctual payment of all payment
obligations of the Contributors insofar as such payment obligations relate to
the indemnification under Article VII. In the case of the failure of the
Contributors to make any such payment as and when due, Delek US hereby agrees
to make such payment or cause such payment to be made, promptly upon written
demand by DKL PG to Delek US, but any delay in providing such notice shall not
under any circumstances reduce the liability of Delek US or operate as a
waiver of DKL PG's right to demand payment. ARTICLE IX

MISCELLANEOUS

9.1 Expenses. Except as provided in Section 3.4 of this Agreement, or as
provided in the Ancillary Documents, all costs and expenses incurred by the
Parties in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and the Ancillary Agreements shall be borne solely and entirely by the
Party which has incurred such expense. For the avoidance of doubt, DKL PG
shall be responsible for all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and
expenses) incurred by the Conflicts Committee in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein. Except as this Agreement
otherwise provides, the Contributors shall each be responsible for 100% of the
payment of the aggregate costs associated with obtaining the Consents
necessary to effect the transfer of the Transferred Assets to DKL PG as
contemplated herein.

hereunder will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given upon

or to such other address or to such other Person as either Party will have

9.3 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be
interpreted in such manner as to be valid and effective under Applicable Law,
but if any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such
provision to any Person or circumstance will be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision
hereof in accordance with this Section 9.3, and the Parties will negotiate in
good faith with a view to substitute for such provision a suitable and
equitable solution in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision.

9.4 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be subject to and governed by the laws
of the State of Texas, excluding any conflicts-of-law rule or principle that
might refer the construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the laws
of another state.

9.5 Arbitration Provision. Any and all Disputes shall be resolved through the
use of binding arbitration using three arbitrators, in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as
supplemented to the extent necessary to determine any procedural appeal
questions by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code).
If there is any inconsistency between this Section 9.5 and the Commercial
Arbitration Rules or the Federal Arbitration Act, the terms of this Section
9.5 will control the rights and obligations of the Parties. Arbitration must
be initiated within the time limits set forth in this Agreement, or if no such
limits apply, then within a reasonable time or the time period allowed by the
applicable statute of limitations. Arbitration may be initiated by Ð° Party
("Claimant") serving written notice on the other Party ("Respondent") that the
Claimant elects to refer the Dispute to binding arbitration. Claimant's notice
initiating binding arbitration must identify the arbitrator Claimant has
appointed. The Respondent shall respond to Claimant within 30 days after
receipt of Claimant's notice, identifying the arbitrator Respondent has
appointed. If the Respondent fails for any reason to name an arbitrator within
the 30-day period, Claimant shall petition the American Arbitration
Association for appointment of an arbitrator for Respondent's account. The two
arbitrators so chosen shall select Ð° third arbitrator within 30 days after the
second arbitrator has been appointed. The Claimant will pay the compensation and expenses of the arbitrator named by or for it, and
the Respondent will pay the compensation and expenses of the arbitrator named
by or for it. The costs of petitioning for the appointment of an arbitrator,
if any, shall be paid by Respondent. The Claimant and Respondent will each pay
one-half of the compensation and expenses of the third arbitrator. All
arbitrators must (a) be neutral parties who have never been officers,
directors or employees of any Contributor, DKL PG or any of their respective
Affiliates and (b) have not less than seven years' experience of in the energy
industry. The hearing will be conducted in Houston, Texas and commence within
30 days after the selection of the third arbitrator. Each Contributor, DKL PG
and the arbitrators shall proceed diligently and in good faith in order that
the award may be made as promptly as possible. Except as provided in the
Federal Arbitration Act, the decision of the arbitrators will be binding on
and non-appealable by the Parties. The arbitrators shall have no right to
grant or award Special Damages in favor of the Contributors, on the one hand
(except to the extent such Special Damages (i) are awarded to a third-party or
(ii) are the result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of DKL PG),
or DKL PG, on the other hand (except to the extent such Special Damages (x)
are awarded to a third-party, or (y) are the result of the fraud, gross
negligence or willful misconduct of any Contributor).

9.6 Confidentiality.

(a) Obligations. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
retain the other Party's Confidential Information in confidence and not
disclose the same to any third party nor use the same, except as authorized by
the disclosing Party in writing or as expressly permitted in this Section 9.6.
Each Party further agrees to take the same care with the other Party's
Confidential Information as it does with its own, but in no event less than a
reasonable degree of care.

(b) Required Disclosure. Notwithstanding Section 9.6(a) above, if the
receiving Party becomes legally compelled to disclose the Confidential
Information by a Governmental Authority or Applicable Law, including the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or is required to
disclose pursuant to the rules and regulations of any national securities
exchange upon which the receiving Party or its parent entity is listed, any of
the disclosing Party's Confidential Information, the receiving Party shall
promptly advise the disclosing Party of such requirement to disclose
Confidential Information as soon as the receiving Party becomes aware that
such a requirement to disclose might become effective, in order that, where
possible, the disclosing Party may seek a protective order or such other
remedy as the disclosing Party may consider appropriate in the circumstances.
The receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the disclosing Party's
Confidential Information that it is required to disclose and shall cooperate
with the disclosing Party in allowing the disclosing Party to obtain such
protective order or other relief.

(c) Return of Information. Upon written request by the disclosing Party, all
of the disclosing Party's Confidential Information in whatever form shall be
returned to the disclosing Party upon termination of this Agreement or
destroyed with destruction certified by the receiving Party, without the
receiving Party retaining copies thereof except that one copy of all such
Confidential Information may be retained by a Party's legal department solely
to the extent that such Party is required to keep a copy of such Confidential
Information pursuant to Applicable Law, and the receiving Party shall be
entitled to retain any Confidential Information in the electronic form or stored on automatic computer back-up archiving systems during the
period such backup or archived materials are retained under such Party's
customary procedures and policies; provided, however, that any Confidential
Information retained by the receiving Party shall be maintained subject to
confidentiality pursuant to the terms of this Section 9.6, and such archived
or back-up Confidential Information shall not be accessed except as required
by Applicable Law.

(d) Receiving Party Personnel. The receiving Party will limit access to the
Confidential Information of the disclosing Party to those of its employees,
attorneys and contractors that have a need to know such information in order
for the receiving Party to exercise or perform its rights and obligations
under this Agreement (the "Receiving Party Personnel"). The Receiving Party
Personnel who have access to any Confidential Information of the disclosing
Party will be made aware of the confidentiality provision of this Agreement
and will be required to abide by the terms thereof; provided, however, that
the receiving party will remain liable for any unauthorized disclosure of
Confidential Information by Receiving Party Personnel. Any third party
contractors that are given access to Confidential Information of a disclosing
Party pursuant to the terms hereof shall be required to sign a written
agreement pursuant to which such Receiving Party Personnel agree to be bound
by the provisions of this Agreement, which written agreement will expressly
state that it is enforceable against such Receiving Party Personnel by the
disclosing Party.

(e) Survival. The obligation of confidentiality under this Section 9.6 shall
survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of two years.

9.7 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely
to the benefit of each Party hereto and their successors and permitted
assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any other Person (other than the Indemnified Parties with respect
to Article VII) any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

9.8 Assignment of Agreement. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any Party without the
prior written consent of the other Party hereto.

9.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts
each of which, when so executed and delivered (including by facsimile or
portable document format (pdf)), will be deemed original but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument.

9.10 Integration. This Agreement, the schedules hereto, the Ancillary
Documents and the Omnibus Agreement supersede any previous understandings or
agreements among the Parties, whether oral or written, with respect to their
subject matters. All schedules referred to herein are intended to be and
hereby are specifically made part of this Agreement. This Agreement, the
schedules hereto, the Ancillary Documents and the Omnibus Agreement contain
the entire understanding of the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof. No understanding, representation, promise or agreement,
whether oral or written, is intended to be or shall be included in or form
part of this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the Omnibus Agreement
unless it is contained in a written amendment hereto or thereto and executed
by the Parties hereto or thereto after the date of this Agreement, the
Ancillary Documents or the Omnibus Agreement. 9.11 Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be terminated, amended or modified
only by a written instrument executed by the Parties and approved by the
Conflicts Committee. Any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement may be
waived in writing at any time by the Party entitled to the benefits thereof.
No waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or any breach
thereof, will be effective unless in writing signed by a duly authorized
individual on behalf of the Party against which the waiver is sought to be
enforced. No waiver of any term or condition or of any breach of this
Agreement will be deemed or will constitute a waiver of any other term or
condition or of any later breach (whether or not similar), nor will such
waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.

9.12 Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants. (a) The
Fundamental Representations shall survive the Closing indefinitely, (b) the
representations and warranties in Section 4.14 shall survive the Closing until
the date that is 60 days after the applicable statute of limitations with
respect thereto (taking into account any extension or waiver thereof), (c) all
other representations and warranties in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing until 5:00 p.m., Nashville, Tennessee time, on the first anniversary
of the Closing Date, and (d) the covenants set forth in this Agreement shall
survive until fully performed in accordance with their terms; provided,
however, that any representation and warranty that is the subject of a claim
for indemnification hereunder which claim was timely made pursuant to Section
7.4(a) shall survive with respect to such claim until such claim is finally
paid or adjudicated.

Agreement and any Schedule, the provisions of the main body of this Agreement
shall prevail;

(e) the term "cost" includes expense and the term "expense" includes cost; (f) the headings and titles herein are for convenience only and shall have no
