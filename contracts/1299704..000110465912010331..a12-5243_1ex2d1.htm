 **WHEREAS** , this Agreement constitutes an agreement of merger, as such term
is used in Section 251(b) of the General Corporation Laws of the State of
Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into
the Company with the Company as the survivor (the " _Merger_ ," and together
with the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the "
_Transactions_ "), and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding share of Common Stock
of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Share_ ") not
owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company will be
converted into the right to receive $10.50 in cash (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), subject to any required withholding of Taxes;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of
Directors_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
has unanimously (i) approved this Agreement, (ii) determined that the

and its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders_ ") and (iii) determined to
recommend that the Company Stockholders adopt this Agreement;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the board of directors of Merger Sub, on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein, has (i) approved this Agreement and (ii)
determined that the Transactions are fair to, advisable and in the best
interests of its stockholders and the board of directors of Parent has
approved this Agreement;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to (i) make certain
representations and warranties, (ii) enter into certain covenants and
agreements in connection with the Merger and (iii) prescribe various
conditions to the Merger; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , as an inducement to the Company to enter into this Agreement,

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as
follows:

      
 

 

 ** **

 

 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 **THE MERGER**

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance
with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, the Company and Merger Sub shall
consummate the Merger pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
thereupon cease, (ii) the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the
Merger and shall continue to be governed by the applicable Laws of the State
of Delaware and (iii) the separate corporate existence of the Company with all
its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue
unaffected by the Merger. The corporation surviving the Merger is sometimes
hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_." The Merger shall
have the effects set forth in applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, subject to _Section 6.7(b)_, (i) the certificate
of incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated in the form set
forth in _Exhibit A_, which shall be, from and after the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Laws; and (ii) the
Company shall take all requisite action so that the bylaws of the Company are
amended and restated in the form set forth in _Exhibit B_, which shall be,
from and after the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein, in the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, or by applicable Laws.

 



 

Section 1.2. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate
of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed on the Closing Date (or on such other
date as Parent and the Company may agree) with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and
shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL to give
effect to the Merger as contemplated hereby. The Merger shall become effective
at the time such Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware or such later date and time as is agreed
upon by the Parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger, such date and
time hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_."

 



 

Section 1.3. _Closing_. Subject to the provisions of _Article VII_, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 11:00 a.m., local
time, on a date to be specified by the Parties to be no later than the third
(3rd) Business Day after satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by
applicable Laws) of the last to be satisfied of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and
Garrison LLP, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York unless another
date or place is agreed to in writing by the Parties. The date on which the
Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

 



      
 

 



 

Section 1.4. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation,
and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, in each case until their respective successors shall have been
duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporations
certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 **CONVERSION OF SECURITIES BY MERGER**

 



 

Section 2.1. _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any
securities of the Company or holders of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ "):

 



 

(a) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Merger Sub
Common Stock shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that
are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any Shares owned by Parent,
Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted automatically into and thereafter represent solely the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, payable to the holder thereof in cash,
without interest. From and after the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate formerly representing any such Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(d) _Adjustment of Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted equitably to reflect any change between the date hereof and the
Effective Time in the number of Shares outstanding by reason of any stock
dividend or other distribution, stock split, reverse stock split,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or the like or any other change in the corporate or capital structure
with a record date during such period (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
with respect to any such action permitted under _Section 5.1_). Nothing in
this _Section 2.1(d)_ shall be construed to require or permit the Company to
take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted, or prohibit the
Company from taking any action that is otherwise permitted by any other
provision of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to (i) designate a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for
the Company Stockholders in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_
") and to receive the funds to which the Company Stockholders shall become
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and (ii) enter into a paying agent
agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with
such Paying Agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration other than funds
to be paid with respect to Company Stock Rights pursuant to _Section 2.4_ in
accordance with this Article II. At the Closing, Parent or Merger Sub shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger
Consideration for the benefit of the Company Stockholders whose Shares will be
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the Company
Stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements, or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with Tier 1 capital exceeding $10
billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are
then publicly available). To the extent such fund diminishes for any reason
below the level required to make payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall replace or restore
the lost portion of such fund so as to ensure that it is sufficient to make
such payment at the time such payment is required to be made pursuant to
_Section 2.2(b)_. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and
exclusive property of Parent, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the
benefit of the Company Stockholders.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event by no later than five (5) Business Days after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") other
than with respect to Company Stock Rights held by employees and whose Shares
were converted pursuant to _Section 2.1_ into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as are reasonably acceptable to the
Company) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and any other documents reasonably required by the
Paying Agent (or, if such Shares are held in book-entry or other
uncertificated form, upon the entry through a book-entry transfer agent of the
surrender of such Shares on a book-entry account statement; it being
understood that any references herein to " _Certificates_ " shall be deemed to
include references to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership
of Shares), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented
by such Certificate, which Merger Consideration, less any amounts required to
be withheld under applicable Laws, shall be paid or mailed as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Paying Agents receipt of

 



      
 

 



 

such documents, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered,
then it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (x) the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer, and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash, less any amounts required
to be withheld under applicable Laws, as contemplated by _Section 2.1_ and
this _Section 2.2_, without interest thereon.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company, other than transfers that occurred before the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Laws. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following six (6) months
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not
disbursed (or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying
Agents routine administrative procedures) to holders of Certificates, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws, as
general creditors thereof) for the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent, nor any employee,
officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any holder
of a Certificate for Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws.

 



 

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, and
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the relevant Merger Consideration or Option Consideration as the case may
be, otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such
amounts that Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, the Treasury Regulations or any provision of applicable state,
local or foreign law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such amounts
shall be (i) paid to the applicable tax authorities when due and (ii) treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

 



   



 

     
 

 



 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate
claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such customary amount as the Surviving
Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount
of the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration.

 



 

Section 2.3. _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenters Provisions_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 2.1(c)_ but shall be cancelled and cease to exist and the holder or
holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Dissenters Provisions;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw, or lose the right to an appraisal of such
holders Shares under the Dissenters Provisions, then the right of such holder
to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and
such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, less any amounts required to be withheld
under applicable Laws, as of the Effective Time as provided in _Section
2.1(c)_.

 



 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal rights in respect of any Shares, any withdrawals of
such demands and any other instrument served on the Company under the DGCL. It
is agreed that Parent, after consulting with the Company and considering the
Companys views in good faith, shall make all decisions, lead all discussions,
negotiations and other proceedings, and coordinate all activities, any
requests that may be made by, or any actions, consents, undertakings,
approvals, or waivers that may be sought in connection with such demands,
withdrawals or instruments, including determining the manner in which to
contest or otherwise respond, by litigation or otherwise, to objections to,
administrative or judicial actions or proceedings in connection with any of
the foregoing. At Parents request, the Company agrees to take all actions
Parent reasonably deems prudent and to otherwise assist Parent in connection
with such demands, withdrawals or instruments. The Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent, make or offer to make any payment with
respect to, or settle or compromise, or offer to settle or compromise, any
such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

Section 2.4. _Treatment of Options and Restricted Stock_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 2.4(e)_ , immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each option to purchase Shares issued by the Company under the Company Stock
Plan or otherwise then outstanding, other than the 2012 Double Trigger Company
Options (each, a " _Single Trigger Company Option_ " and together with the
2012 Double Trigger Company Options, the " _Company Options_ ") shall, to the
extent not then vested, become or otherwise be

 



      
 

 



 

deemed fully vested effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. At the
Effective Time, each Single Trigger Company Option (including those Single
Trigger Company Options with respect to which the accelerated vesting
described in the preceding sentence applies) shall be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash,
without interest, determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price per Share of the
Single Trigger Company Option by (ii) the number of Shares subject to such
Single Trigger Company Option (the " _Single Trigger Option Consideration_ ,"
and together with the 2012 Double Trigger Option Consideration, the " _Option
Consideration_ "), less any amounts required to be withheld under applicable
Laws, which amounts shall be paid at the time specified in _Section 2.4(f)_.
For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the product obtained by such
calculation with respect to a Single Trigger Company Option is zero or a
negative number, then such Single Trigger Company Option shall, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, be cancelled for no consideration.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase Shares issued by the
Company during 2012 under the Company Stock Plan to employees other than the
Named Executive Officers (each, a " _2012 Double Trigger Company Option_ ")
that remains issued and outstanding shall be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash, without
interest, determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the applicable exercise price per Share of the 2012 Double
Trigger Company Option by (ii) the number of Shares subject to such 2012
Double Trigger Company Option (the " _2012 Double Trigger Option
Consideration_ "), less any amounts required to be withheld under applicable
Laws, which amounts shall be paid at the time specified in _Section 2.4(f)_ ;
_provided_ , that to the extent that all or a portion of such 2012 Double
Trigger Company Option is not vested and exercisable as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, then no amount shall be payable in respect of such
unvested portion of such 2012 Double Trigger Company Option unless and until
such unvested portion vests in accordance with the terms of the applicable
2012 Double Trigger Company Option award agreement, which agreement shall
provide for accelerated vesting upon "Involuntary Termination" (as defined in
_Section 2.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule) of such employees
employment by the Company or a Company Subsidiary. For the avoidance of
doubt, in the event that the product obtained by such calculation with respect
to a 2012 Double Trigger Company Option is zero or a negative number, then
such 2012 Double Trigger Company Option shall, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, be cancelled for no consideration.

 



 

(c) Subject to _Section 2.4(e)_ , immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each Share then outstanding and subject to restrictions on transfer or
forfeiture issued by the Company under the Company Stock Plan or otherwise,
including those Shares subject to performance-based conditions, other than the
2012 Double Trigger Restricted Stock (" _Single Trigger Restricted Stock_ "
and together with the 2012 Double Trigger Restricted Stock, " _Restricted
Stock_ ") shall become or otherwise be deemed fully vested effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and all dividend payments with
respect to such Single Trigger Restricted Stock held in escrow pending vesting
of such Single Trigger Restricted Stock (the aggregate amount of which as of
the date hereof is set forth on _Section 2.4(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule) shall be released and paid to the holders of such Single Trigger
Restricted Stock, less any amounts required to be withheld under applicable
Laws. At the Effective Time,

 



      
 

 



 

each vested, issued and outstanding Share of Single Trigger Restricted Stock
shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_ hereof, less any amounts required to be
withheld under applicable Laws. All amounts payable under this _Section
2.4(c)_ shall be paid at the time specified in _Section 2.4(f)_.

 



 

(d) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Share subject to restrictions
on transfer or forfeiture issued by the Company during 2012 under the Company
Stock Plan to employees other than the Named Executive Officers, including
those Shares subject to performance-based conditions (" _2012 Double Trigger
Restricted Stock_ "), shall to the extent not then vested be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section
2.1(c)_ hereof, less any amounts required to be withheld under applicable
Laws, subject to the same conditions on vesting as applied to such Share of
2012 Double Trigger Restricted Stock immediately prior the Effective Time,
without any crediting of interest for the period from the Effective Time until
vesting, which amounts shall be paid at the time specified in _Section 2.4(f)_
; provided, that no amount shall be payable in respect of such 2012 Double
Trigger Restricted Stock unless and until it vests in accordance with the
terms of the applicable 2012 Double Trigger Restricted Stock award agreement,
which agreement shall provide for accelerated vesting upon "Involuntary
Termination" (as defined in _Section 2.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule) of such employees employment by the Company or a Company
Subsidiary. All dividend payments with respect to such 2012 Double Trigger
Restricted Stock shall, to the extent held in escrow pending vesting of such
2012 Double Trigger Restricted Stock, be released and paid to the holder of
such 2012 Double Trigger Restricted Stock in accordance with the terms of the
applicable 2012 Double Trigger Restricted Stock award agreement, less any
amounts required to be withheld under applicable Laws, which amounts shall be
paid at the time specified in _Section 2.4(f)_.

 



 

(e) The treatment of the Single Trigger Company Options and Single Trigger
Restricted Stock as set forth in _Section 2.4(a)_ and _Section 2.4(c)_ ,
respectively, for each employee holder of a then unvested Single Trigger
Company Option or then unvested Single Trigger Restricted Stock is conditioned
upon such holder executing on or prior to the Effective Time the Companys
current form Protective Covenant Agreement set forth on _Section 2.4(e)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. If the holder of any then unvested Single
Trigger Company Options or then unvested Single Trigger Restricted Stock does
not execute such a Protective Covenant Agreement prior to the Effective Time,
then such Single Trigger Company Options or Single Trigger Restricted Stock
shall be treated in the same manner as the 2012 Double Trigger Company Options
or 2012 Double Trigger Restricted Stock, respectively, in accordance with
_Section 2.4(b)_ or _Section 2.4(d)_ , as applicable.

 



 

(f) The Surviving Corporation shall pay, in accordance with its regular
payroll practices, to the holders of Single Trigger Company Options the Single
Trigger Option Consideration, without interest and less any amounts required
to be withheld under applicable Laws, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, but in any event not later than the first regular payroll

Time. The Surviving Corporation shall pay, in accordance with its regular
payroll practices, to the holders of 2012 Double Trigger Company Options, the

Trigger Company Options (or portions thereof) are

 



      
 

 



 

vested as of or before the Effective Time, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, but in any event not later than the first regular
payroll that occurs not earlier than five (5) Business Days following the
Effective Time and (ii) if such 2012 Double Trigger Company Options (or
portions thereof) become vested on a date following the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, as soon as reasonably practicable after the vesting
thereof, but in any event not later than the first regular payroll that occurs
not earlier than five (5) Business Days following the date of such vesting.

vests on a date following the date on which the Effective Time occurs, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the vesting thereof, but in any event not

respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) under the Laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the requisite corporate or other
power, as the case may be, and corporate authority to carry on its business as
now being conducted. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification necessary, except for those jurisdictions
where the failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing has not had, or
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is in compliance in all respects
with the terms of the Company Governing Documents, each Company Subsidiary is
in compliance in all respects with the terms of its respective certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or the equivalent organizational documents), and the
Company has made available to Parent correct and complete copies of all such

ownership structure of each Company Subsidiary. All the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each such Company

issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or
indirectly by the Company free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted
Liens, and free of any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise

Section 3.7. _Internal Controls_.

 



 

(a) The Company has designed and maintains a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting including that (a) transactions are
executed in accordance with Company managements general or specific
authorizations; (b) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
Company managements general or specific authorizations; and (c) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. The
Company has designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules
and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. To the
Knowledge of the Company, there is no fraud, whether or not material, that
involves any of the senior financial officers of the Company in relation to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Since January 1, 2010 to the date
hereof, the Company has not identified any material weaknesses in the design
or operation of its internal control over financial reporting except as
disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof. Neither
the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has
arranged any

 



      
 

 



 

outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers of the
Company within the meaning of Section 402 of the SOXA.

 



 

(b) Since January 1, 2009, none of the Company, any officer of the Company,
the independent accountants of the Company, the Company Board of Directors or
the audit committee of the Company Board of Directors has received any oral or
written notification of any (i) "significant deficiency" in the Companys
internal controls over financial reporting, (ii) "material weakness" in the
Companys internal controls over financial reporting or (iii) fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees of the Company
who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting. There is no outstanding "significant deficiency" or "material
weakness" which the Companys independent accountants certify has not been
appropriately and adequately remedied by the Company. For purposes of this
Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency" and "material weakness" shall
have the meaning assigned to them in Auditing Standard No. 5 of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board, as in effect on the date hereof.

 



 

(c) The books and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
been and are being maintained in accordance with GAAP and all other applicable
legal and accounting requirements in all material respects.

(c) No claim of invalidity or conflicting ownership rights has been made or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened by a third party with respect to
any Company-owned Intellectual Property, and no Company-owned Intellectual
Property is the subject of any pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened Legal Proceeding challenging the Companys ownership rights in such
Company-owned Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of the Company, the
conduct of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries does not
infringe or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property or other proprietary
rights of any other Person in any material respect, and no Person has given
written notice to the Company or any Company Subsidiary that the use of any
Company Intellectual Property by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or, in
the case of Company-owned Intellectual Property, by any licensee, is
infringing or violating or has infringed or violated any third partys
domestic or foreign rights in or to any Intellectual Property, or that the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any licensee of Company-owned Intellectual
Property has misappropriated or improperly used or disclosed any trade secret,
confidential or proprietary information or know-how as a result of its use of
the Company-owned Intellectual Property, and there is no Legal Proceeding
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened alleging any of the
foregoing or any existing fact or circumstance that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any such Legal

 



       
 

 



 

Proceeding. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company-owned
Intellectual Property has been or is currently being infringed,
misappropriated or otherwise violated by any third party. To the Knowledge of
the Company, there exists no prior act or current conduct or use by the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any third party that would void or
invalidate any Company-owned Intellectual Property,

 



 

(d) The Company and each Company Subsidiary have taken reasonable measures
consistent with applicable Laws and industry standards to safeguard the
confidentiality and value of all Company-owned Intellectual Property. No third
party has any joint ownership interest in or to any Company-owned Intellectual
Property.

 



 

(e) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and each
ancillary agreement by the Company and the consummation of the Transactions
will not breach, violate, or conflict with any instrument or agreement
concerning the Companys or a Company Subsidiarys use of any Company
Intellectual Property, will not cause the forfeiture or termination or give
rise to a right of forfeiture or termination of any rights in or to the
Company Intellectual Property or impair the right of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to (i) use any Company Intellectual Property and (ii) make, use,
sell, license, or dispose of, or to bring any action for the infringement of,
any Company-owned Intellectual Property, all in the same form and manner as

designed to permit unauthorized access or to disable or otherwise harm any

computer program automatically with the passage of time or under the positive
control of a Person other than an authorized licensee or owner of the
software. No software used in the business of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries contains or requires use of any "open source" code, shareware or
other software that is made generally available to the public without
requiring payment of fees or royalties or that does or may require disclosure
or licensing of any such software or any other Company-owned Intellectual
Property. ** **No rights under the Company-owned Intellectual Property are
obligated to be (x) waived as to or (y) licensed to any Person as a result of
the Companys or the Company Subsidiaries use of "open source" code in its
respective software.

payments of any material amount to any of its employees for any wages,
salaries, commissions, bonuses or other direct compensation for any services

or a Company Subsidiary, as applicable, as being (i) "exempt" from the minimum
wage or overtime requirements (within the meaning of the Fair Labor Standards
Act of 1938) or (ii) an independent contractor rather than an employee, is
properly so characterized in all material respects. The Company and each of
the Company Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with the

States, and to the Knowledge of the Company, there is no basis for any claim
that the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries are not in all material
respects in compliance with the terms thereof.

months. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has incurred
any liability or obligation under WARN or any similar foreign, state or local
Laws that remains unsatisfied. To the extent that, after Closing, Parent
operates the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in the same manner
operated by the Company during the six (6) month period prior to the Closing,
Parent will not incur any liability under WARN or any other similar foreign,
state or local Laws as a result of any layoffs or other employment
terminations made by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries during
such six (6) month period prior to the Closing.

Company Subsidiary has received in the last thirty-six (36) months or in the
period since its last examination, whichever is longer, any

 



      
 

 



 

written or, to the Knowledge of the Company, verbal notice from any
Governmental Authority or any follow-up communication related to a prior
written or verbal notice, regarding (i) any actual, alleged, or potential
material violation of, or material failure to comply with, any Law, or (ii)
any actual, alleged, or potential obligation on the part of such Person to

any Governmental Authority in order for the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to operate the payday lending business of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries in the states set forth on _Section 9.5_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule as of the date hereof. ** **Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has received in the last thirty-six (36) months any
written, or to the Knowledge of the Company, verbal notice from any
Governmental Authority regarding (i) any actual, alleged, or potential
material violation of, or material failure to comply with, any such Permit, or

lapse, or limitation of any such Permit that would have more than a _de
minimis_ economic impact on the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

Subsidiaries, as applicable, have complied in all material respects with the
terms and provisions of such policies. There is no material claim by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary pending under any of such policies or bonds

under applicable

 



      
 

 



 

Laws, (i) make a Company Change in Recommendation in response to either (x)
the Companys receipt of a bona fide written and, following the Solicitation
Period Termination Date (with respect to any Person other than an Excluded
Party) and following the Go-Shop Period Termination Date (with respect to any
Third Party), an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party after the
date hereof and that does not result from a breach of _Section 5.2_ that
would, if this Agreement was not amended, constitute a Superior Proposal or
(y) any event, change, or development occurring or arising after the date
hereof, or any fact or circumstance, which event, change, development, fact,
or circumstance was not actually known, appreciated or understood by the
Company Board of Directors as of the date hereof and not relating to any

enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, and specifying the reasons
therefor, including the identity of the Third Party making such Superior
Proposal and a copy of such Alternative Acquisition Agreement (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other
material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and an
additional three (3) Business Day period and compliance with this _Section
5.3(b)_ with respect to each such new notice), (2) unless during such five (5)
Business Day period (and additional three (3) Business Day period), the
Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, unless waived in
writing by Parent, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the
Company Board of Directors to proceed with making the Company Recommendation
and not make such a Company Change in Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement, and (3) unless, prior to the expiration of such five (5) Business
Day period (and any additional three (3) Business Day period), Parent does not
make a proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement that the
Company Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with
the Company Financial Advisor or another financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) to be at least as favorable
as the Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _further_ , that, in the case of an
Intervening Event, no Company Change in Recommendation pursuant to this
_Section 5.3(b)_ may be made (A) until after the fifth (5th) Business Day
following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent
that the Company Board of Directors intends to take such action and specifying
the facts underlying the Company Board of Directors determination that an
Intervening Event has occurred, and the reason for the Company Change in

material change in such Intervening Event shall require a new written notice
and an additional three (3) Business Day period and compliance with this
_Section 5.3(b)_ with respect to each such new notice), (B) unless during
such five (5) Business Day period (and any additional three (3) Business Day
period), the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, to the
extent requested by Parent, negotiate with Parent in good faith to enable
Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for a
Company Change in Recommendation, and (C) unless, by the expiration of such

Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, taking into consideration
any amendments to this Agreement proposed by Parent (after consultation with

Company Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Laws.

pursuant to, and in accordance with, _Section 8.1_, (i) the obligation of the
Company to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and

position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure to the Company Stockholders, if, the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the

that, in no event shall the Company Board of Directors take any action
prohibited by _Section 5.2_ or this _Section 5.3_ without complying with the
terms of such provision. In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for
purposes of this Agreement, any disclosure that constitutes a stop, look, and
listen communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or similar communication
to the Company Stockholders shall not constitute a Company Change in

Time and (b) any material failure of the Company, on the one hand, or Merger

any investigation or other inquiry by any such Governmental Authority. Each of
the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and

waivers are required to be given or obtained, or should be given or obtained,
from parties to any Company Material Contracts in connection with consummation
of the Transactions and seeking any such actions, notices, consents,
approvals, or waivers.

 



 

(c) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, each of Parent and the
Company shall promptly notify the other in writing of any pending or, to the

insofar as the Company, Parent, and Merger Sub may otherwise agree, any such
action or proceeding, including any action or proceeding that seeks a
temporary

 



      
 

 



 

restraining order or preliminary injunction that would prohibit, prevent, or
restrict consummation of, or impose a materially adverse condition upon, the
Transactions. It is agreed that Parent and the Company shall jointly control
all such actions and proceedings and shall jointly coordinate all activities,
any requests that may be made by, or any actions, consents, undertakings,
approvals, or waivers that may be sought in connection with such actions or
proceedings, including determining the manner in which to contest or otherwise
respond, by litigation or otherwise, to objections to, administrative or
judicial actions or proceedings challenging the consummation of the Merger and
the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the resolution of any
administrative or judicial actions or proceedings challenging the consummation
of the Merger or the Transactions involves, or is reasonably likely to
involve, any (i) payment or (ii) remedy of the type described in clauses (1)
through (6) of _Section 6.5(e)_ and such payment or remedy would reasonably
be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have an adverse impact
(except to the extent immaterial) on any of the businesses or assets or that
may impact (except to the extent immaterial) the current or future business
models, plans, or structures of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, then Parent shall have the sole right to determine whether
or not to agree to such payment or remedy. Notwithstanding the obligations of
the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent, or Merger Sub as set forth in
this _Section 6.5_, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary, on the
one hand, nor Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall be required to,
prior to the Effective Time, make or commit to make any material payment to
any third party or agree to any material amendment, waiver, or modification to
any Company Material Contract or any other agreement, as applicable, or any
limitation on the conduct of its business, in order to obtain any such
consent, approval, or waiver unless the Company or Parent, as applicable,
shall agree to reimburse the other Party for such payment or any such
amendment, waiver, or modification will not be effective if the Effective Time
does not occur.

 



 

(e) It is agreed that Parent and the Company shall jointly control the
obtaining or filing of all Permits (other than those in connection with the
HSR Act) required to be obtained or made by the Company, a Company Subsidiary,
Parent or Merger Sub, including the Company Governmental Filings, in
connection with the authorization, execution, and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions. It is further agreed that the
Company and Parent shall jointly select mutually agreeable lead outside
counsel for the purposes of obtaining the Permits (other than those in
connection with the HSR Act) required to be obtained or made by Parent, Merger
Sub, or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to
_Section 6.5(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that each shall have the right to
hire independent counsel in order to advise such party in addition to such
lead outside counsel. If necessary to obtain from any Governmental Authority
any Permits required to be obtained or made by Parent or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, under the HSR Act or with respect to any
Company Governmental Filing, each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate
with each other, and use its reasonable best efforts, and Parent shall cause
each of Merger Sub, Guarantor, and Guarantors Affiliates to use their
collective reasonable best efforts, to resolve such objections as may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority, including taking all reasonable
actions reasonably necessary to resolve any matters regarding their respective
suitability to make or obtain such Permits. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, in connection with any filing or submission
required or action to be taken by any of Parent, Merger Sub, Guarantor and
Guarantors Affiliates, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, to
consummate the Transactions, in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub, Guarantor

 



      
 

 



 

or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates be
obligated to (1) propose or agree to make any Divestiture, (2) agree to any

effective control or exercise of full rights of ownership of any asset or
business (including the Company and its assets, respectively), (3) accept any
operational restriction, (4) take or commit to take any other action,
undertaking, condition or consent decree, (5) terminate or amend any existing
or contemplated governance structure or contemplated contractual or governance
rights, or (6) enter into any agreement if, in any such case as described in
clauses (1) through (6) above, doing so would reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have an adverse impact (except to the
extent immaterial) on any of their respective businesses or assets or that may
impact (except to the extent immaterial) the current or future business
models, plans, or structures of Guarantor and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except, in the case of the Company, at
the request of Parent, if the effectiveness or consummation thereof is
conditioned on the consummation of the Merger.

 



 

Section 6.6. _Publicity_. Except with respect to any Company Change in
Recommendation or any other action taken by the Company or the Company Board
of Directors (or committee of the Board of Directors) pursuant to, and in
accordance with _Section 5.2_ and _Section 5.3_, so long as this Agreement
is in effect, Company and Parent shall consult with each other and, to the
extent practicable, provide each other reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any press release or other public announcement with respect to the
Merger or this Agreement prior to issuance of such press release or public
announcement, and shall not issue or publish any such press release or other
public announcement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable Laws or by any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a
national securities exchange or trading market, in which case, reasonable best
efforts to consult with the other Party shall be made prior to any such
issuance or publication.

agreements between a Covered Person and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries
(each, an " _Indemnification Agreement_ "), shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect (and shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any adverse respect) for a period of not less than six
(6) years after the Effective Time, or with respect to any such
Indemnification Agreement, in accordance with the terms of such
Indemnification Agreement. If any Covered Person is or becomes involved in

Covered Person would be entitled to be indemnified by the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, then to the extent not provided in the foregoing, the
Company, and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause Surviving Corporation to), pay, as incurred, such Covered
Persons legal fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with such Legal
Proceeding, subject to receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Covered Person to repay such legal fees, costs and expenses if it is
ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (after all rights
to

 



      
 

 



 

appeal shall have expired) that such Covered Person is not entitled to be
indemnified under applicable Laws.

 



 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the respective
certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational or
governing documents of the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of Covered Persons for periods prior
to and including the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the
Company Governing Documents and the certificates of incorporation, bylaws, or
similar organizational and governing documents of the Company Subsidiaries.

Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their
respective terms, the covenants contained in this _Section 6.7. _Parent shall

from facts or events that actually or allegedly occurred on or before the
Effective Time, including in connection with the approval of the Merger and
the adoption of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may
substitute therefor policies of substantially equivalent coverage and amounts
containing terms no less favorable to the Covered Persons than the existing
DandO Insurance, EPL Insurance, and Fiduciary Insurance (so long as such
policies are provided by the Companys current insurance carrier or by a
carrier with a rating no lower than an A.M. Best rating of A); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that (i) if the existing DandO Insurance, EPL Insurance or Fiduciary
Insurance expires or is terminated or cancelled during such period, the Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain and maintain
substantially similar DandO Insurance, EPL Insurance, or Fiduciary Insurance (as
applicable) (with such replacement policies to be provided by the Companys
current insurance carrier or by a carrier with a rating no lower than an A.M.
Best rating of A); (ii) in no event shall Parent be required to pay aggregate
premiums for insurance under this _Section 6.7(c)_ in excess of 250% of the
aggregate premiums paid by the Company in 2011 for such purpose (the " _Base
Premium_ "), the true and correct amount of which is set forth on _Section
6.7(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule; and (iii) if Parent or the
Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the amount of insurance required by
this _Section 6.7(c)_ for such aggregate premium, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain as much insurance as can be
obtained for aggregate premiums not in excess of 250% of the Base Premium. At
the Companys option, it may, after consulting with Parent and considering
Parents views in good faith, elect to obtain prepaid "tail" or "runoff"
policies prior to the Effective Time covering a period of six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time with respect to acts and omissions occurring on
or prior to the Effective Time; provided that the premium therefor does not
exceed 250% of the Base Premium. In the event the Company purchases a "tail"
or "runoff" policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall

 



      
 

 



 

maintain such tail or runoff policy in full force and effect in lieu of all
other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation in the first
sentence of this _Section 6.7(c)_ for so long as any such tail or runoff
policy remains in full force and effect.

 



 

(d) The rights of each Covered Person hereunder shall be in addition to, and
not in limitation of, any other rights such Covered Person may have under the
certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organization or governing
documents of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, any other indemnification
arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise.

Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in each
such case, proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving
corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall
assume all of the applicable obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

 



 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall survive the consummation of
the Merger. The Covered Persons (and their successors and heirs) are intended
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.7_, and this _Section 6.7_
shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons
(including their successors and heirs) or terminated without the consent of
the Covered Persons (including their successors and heirs) affected thereby.

 



 

Section 6.8. _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition," "fair
price," or other anti-takeover Laws or regulations enacted under state or
federal Laws becomes or is deemed to become applicable to the Company, the
Merger or any other Transaction, then the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and the
members of their respective boards of directors shall take all action
reasonably necessary and appropriate to render such statute inapplicable to
the foregoing.

 



 

Section 6.9. _Section 16 of the Exchange Act_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company Board of Directors, or an appropriate committee of non-employee

respect to the status thereof. It is agreed that Parent, after consulting with
the Company and considering the Companys views in good faith, shall make all
decisions, lead all discussions, negotiations and other proceedings, and
coordinate all activities, any requests that may be made by, or any actions,
consents, undertakings, approvals, or waivers that may be sought in connection
with any such stockholder litigation, including determining the

 



      
 

 



 

manner in which to contest or otherwise respond to such stockholder
litigation. Notwithstanding anything else contained in this _Section 6.10_,
the Company may direct Parent to settle or otherwise compromise any
stockholder litigation related to this Agreement if such settlement or
compromise does not involve the imposition of (i) material equitable relief
(which shall include any injunction, specific performance or similar demand or
order) on the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii) criminal liability on
the Company or any Company Subsidiary and (iii) the aggregate amount of all
such settlements or compromises do not exceed the amount set forth on _Section

and wage rates, cash bonus (other than equity based incentive arrangements),
severance practices, and employee benefits that are substantially comparable
in the aggregate to those provided to such Affected Employees under the
Benefit Plans or practices (other than equity-based incentive arrangements)
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
subject to the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the amendment or
termination of any Benefit Plans as necessary to conform with applicable Law
or interfere with the Surviving Corporations obligation to make such changes
as are necessary to conform with applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the foregoing shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries of any obligation to any Affected Employees under an individual
employment agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) With respect to any employee benefit plan or program maintained or
contributed to by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Parent Benefit
Plan_ ") in which an Affected Employee may participate, or may become eligible
to participate, Parent shall: (i) provide or cause to be provided to each
Affected Employee service credit to the extent such service would be
recognized if it had been performed as an employee of Parent or its
Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and levels of
benefits (but not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan,
any retiree medical or other post-retirement welfare plan, benefits under any
frozen employee benefit plan or as would otherwise result in a duplication of
benefits) for all periods of employment with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date; (ii) waive, to the extent within
Parents control and ability under any current Parent Benefit Plan, or use
reasonable best efforts to cause any third-party insurance carriers to waive,
pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility, waiting periods or

 



      
 

 



 

required physical examinations under any Parent Benefit Plan which is a
welfare plan with respect to the Affected Employees and their eligible
dependents, to the extent waived under the corresponding Benefit Plan in which
the applicable Affected Employees participated immediately prior to the
Closing Date and, with respect to life insurance coverage, up to the Affected
Employees current level of insurability; and (iii) provide, to the extent
within Parents control and ability under any current Parent Benefit Plan, or
use reasonable best efforts to cause any third-party insurance carriers to
provide, the Affected Employees and their eligible dependents credit for the
plan year in which the Closing Date occurs towards applicable co-payments,
deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred prior to the
Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, no Affected Employee shall be
retroactively eligible for any Parent Benefit Plan, including any such Parent
Benefit Plan that was frozen prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that no provision of this Agreement
shall be construed to: (i) create any right to any compensation or benefits
whatsoever on the part of any Affected Employee or other future, present or
former employee of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates; (ii) guarantee employment for any period of time
or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to terminate
any employee, independent contractor or Affected Employee for any reason at
any time; require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any Benefit
Plan, Parent Benefit Plan, or other employee compensation or benefit plans or
arrangements, or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof
after the Closing; or (iv) constitute an amendment to any Benefit Plan, Parent
Benefit Plan, or other employee benefit or compensation plans or arrangements.
Nothing in this _Section 6.11_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed
to make any employee, former employee, independent contractor or Affected
Employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) a third party
beneficiary of this _Section 6.11_ or any rights relating hereto.

 



 

Section 6.12. _Stock Exchange De-Listing_. Parent and the Surviving

de-listed from the NYSE and de-registered under the Exchange Act promptly
following the Effective Time.

shall cause each member of the Company Board of Directors to execute and
deliver a letter, which shall not be revoked or amended prior to the Effective
Time, effectuating his or her resignation as a member of the Company Board of
Directors effective immediately prior to, and conditional on, the Effective
Time.

 



 

Section 6.14. _Repayment of Outstanding Indebtedness_. Subject to the receipt
from Parent of the funds necessary to make all necessary payments under this
_Section 6.14_, the Company shall obtain, at or prior to the Closing, a
payoff letter with respect to the Existing Credit Facility in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent (the " _Payoff Letter_ "),
together with such other documents and instruments as may reasonably be
required by Parent to demonstrate that, effective as of the payment of the
amount provided in the Payoff Letter to the party identified therein, which
the Company shall pay on the Closing, (i) the Existing Credit Facility shall
terminate (except for those provisions that customarily survive termination),
(ii) all Indebtedness and other payment obligations of the Company and its
affiliates under the Existing

 



      
 

 



 

Credit Facility shall be repaid in full, (iii) all letters of credit
outstanding thereunder shall either terminate or, if arrangements are made for
any such letter of credit to remain outstanding following the termination of
the Existing Credit Facility, each such letter of credit shall be cash
collateralized pursuant to arrangements described in the Existing Credit
Facility or otherwise reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and (iv) all of the
Companys and its Affiliates assets and properties are free from any and all

Section 9.7. _Interpretation; Disclosure Schedules_.

 



 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, such reference
shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. For
purposes of this Agreement, (i) the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation" or "but not limited to," (ii) the word "or" is not
exclusive and is used in the inclusive sense of "and/or," and (iii) the words
"herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereto," and "hereunder" refer to this
Agreement as a whole. All references to this Agreement shall be deemed to
include references to the "plan of merger" contained herein (as such term is
used in the DGCL). Unless otherwise specified, all references herein to
"dollar" or "$" shall be references to United States dollars. The headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Wherever
used herein, a pronoun in the masculine gender shall be considered as
including the feminine gender unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.
The terms "made available" or "provided," when referring to information,
documents, projections, forecasts or other material made available to Parent
or Merger Sub, mean that such information, documents, projections, forecasts
or other material have been placed in the electronic "data room" in connection
with the Transactions, otherwise provided to Parent or its Representatives or
made available to Parent or its Representatives at the offices of the Company
located at 135 North Church Street, Spartanburg, South Carolina 29306 as
described on _Section 9.7(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. References
herein to any Law shall be deemed to refer to such Law as amended, modified,
codified, reenacted, supplemented or superseded in whole or in part and in
effect from time to time, and also to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, except where the reference to Law speaks as of a date certain or
references the effect of a change in Law. Whenever this Agreement requires a

 



       
 

 



 

Company Subsidiary to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Company
Subsidiary to take such action.

 



 

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) each Disclosure Schedule may
include certain items and information solely for informational purposes for
the convenience of the Party to which such Disclosure Schedule is delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) the disclosure by the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub on the other hand, of any matter in its
Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by the
Company or Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, that the matter is required
to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material.
Each disclosure set forth in the Disclosure Schedules is identified by
reference to, or has been grouped under a heading referring to a specific
section of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company or
Parent and Merger Sub disclose in any section or schedule of its Disclosure
Schedule an item or information in such a way as to make its relevance to the
disclosure required by another section or schedule thereof readily apparent,
then the matter shall be deemed to have been disclosed in such other section
or schedule, notwithstanding the omission of an appropriate cross-reference to
such other section or schedule.

 



 

Section 9.8. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed manually or by
facsimile (or other electronically scanned and transmitted means) by the
Parties, in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be considered one
and the same agreement and shall become effective when a counterpart hereof
shall have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other
Parties. Facsimile or portable document format (PDF) signatures shall be
treated as original signatures for all purposes hereunder.

 



 

Section 9.9. _No Reliance_. The Companys representations and warranties in
_Article III_ are the product of negotiations among the Parties and are
solely for the benefit of Parent and Merger Sub. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties hereto
pursuant to _Section 9.16_ and are qualified by the Confidentiality Agreement
containing non-public information. Consequently, the Companys
representations and warranties in _Article III_ may not be relied upon by
Persons other than the Parties hereto as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date hereof or as of any other date, and such
representations and warranties may not be relied upon by the Companys
stockholders in making the decision to approve and authorize this Agreement
and the transactions expressly contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement
may only be enforced by Parent and Merger Sub.

 



 

Section 9.10. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement, the exhibits to this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule and
any documents delivered by the Parties in connection herewith constitute the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties with respect thereto.

 



 

Section 9.11. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner adverse to

 



      
 

 



 

any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Merger is fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



 

Section 9.12. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) Except as required by the mandatory provisions of the DGCL, this Agreement
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State
of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that would
result in the application of the law of any other state.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware State
court, or, if no such state court has proper jurisdiction, the Federal court
of the United States of America, sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court
from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the
Transactions or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment
relating thereto, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding
except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such Delaware State court
or, if no such state court has proper jurisdiction, in such Federal court,
(iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such action or proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal court, and
(iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such
Delaware State or Federal court. Each of the Parties agrees that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law. Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in _Section 9.4_. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted
by law.

 



 

Section 9.13. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
MERGER CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _Section 9.13_.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.14. _Assignment; Benefit_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by
any of the Parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other Parties. Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the Parties or their
respective heirs, successors, executors, administrators and assigns any
rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this
Agreement, except for (i) the provisions of _Section 6.7_ hereof which shall
inure to the benefit of the Persons or entities benefiting therefrom who are
expressly intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof and who may enforce
the covenants contained therein, (ii) at the Effective Time, the rights of the
holders of Shares to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, (iii) at the Effective Time, the
rights of the holders of the Company Options to receive payments contemplated
by the applicable provisions of _Section 2.4(a)_ in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, (iv) subject to the proviso at the end of
_Section 8.2_, the right of the Company, on behalf of the holders of equity
interests in the Company, to pursue damages in the event of a failure by
Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions, which right is hereby
acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub and (v) _Section 9.12_,
_Section 9.13_, this _Section 9.14_ and the last sentence of _Section 9.15_
(which, in each case, will be for the benefit of the Persons set forth
therein, and any such Person will have the rights provided for therein).

 



 

Section 9.15. _Specific Performance; Remedies_. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, except as expressly provided in the following sentence. It
is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the State of
Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, without proof
of actual damages, and to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity (subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement), other than as limited hereunder. The
Parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in
this _Section 9.15_, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek
any other form of relief that may be available to a Party (including monetary
damages) in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event
that the remedies provided for in this _Section 9.15_ are not available or
otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section 9.15_
shall require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any Partys
right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this
_Section 9.15_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right
under _Article VIII_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall
the commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to this _Section 9.15_ or
anything set forth in this _Section 9.15_ restrict or limit any Partys right
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article VIII_ or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter.

 



 

Section 9.16. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
may, to the extent permitted under applicable Laws, (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations of the other Party, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of

 



      
 

 



 

the other Party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered under
this Agreement or, (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party
to any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed by such Party. The failure of any Party to assert any of
its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
such rights.

 



      
 

 



 

 **IN WITNESS WHEREOF** , Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized
as of the date first written above.
