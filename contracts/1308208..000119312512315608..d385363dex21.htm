cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_) shall be converted into the right to
receive 0.700 of a share (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of Parent Common Stock
(together with any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares with respect thereto
in accordance with _Section 2.13(d)_, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company or Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof.

(c) Each common share, no par value, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common
Stock_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into, and exchanged for, one newly and validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable common share, no par value, of Transitory Surviving
Corporation (" _Transitory Surviving Corporation Common Stock_ "), and each
certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall
evidence ownership of such shares of Transitory Surviving Corporation Common
Stock.

 

Section 2.11 Conversion of Shares in the Subsequent Merger. At the Subsequent
Merger Effective Time and by virtue of the Subsequent Merger and without any
further action on the part of the parties or any shareholder of the Transitory
Surviving Corporation and/or equityholder of Sister Sub, each share of

to the Subsequent Merger Effective Time shall be converted into, and exchanged
for, one newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable limited
liability company interest of Sister Sub, and each certificate
evidencing ownership of shares of Transitory Surviving Corporation Common
Stock shall evidence ownership of such limited liability company interest of
Sister Sub.

Section 2.12 Closing of the Companys Transfer Books. At the Effective Time,
holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights as shareholders of the

 



21  Company, and the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed with
respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common
Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any of
such shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Stock Certificate_ ") is
presented to the Surviving Company or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate
shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in _Section 2.13_.

 

Section 2.13 Exchange of Certificates; Fractional Shares; Closing Payments.

 

(a) At or immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver (or
cause to be delivered) or pay (or cause to be paid) in cash in immediately
available funds, as applicable, the following:

(i) to each Company Shareholder, certificates for Parent Common Stock
representing the Merger Consideration payable to such Company Shareholder in
accordance with _Section 2.10(a)_, free and clear of all Liens;

 

(ii) to each Company Shareholder, the cash payable to such Company Shareholder
in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to  _Section 2.13(d)_;

(iii) to the payees thereof in accordance with the Third Party Payoff
Letters, the cash payoff amounts set forth therein;

(iv) to the lender or lenders thereof, an aggregate amount of cash equal to
the Parent Indebtedness; and

(v) to the payees thereof in accordance with the Company Shareholder Payoff
Letters the cash payoff amounts set forth therein in satisfaction of the
liability thereof assumed from the Company.

 

(b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and
shall cause each of the Company Shareholders to, deliver (or cause to be
delivered) the following:

(i) to Parent, Company Stock Certificates representing all of the shares of
Company Common Stock held by such Company Shareholder, free and clear of all
Liens; and

(ii) to Parent, an IRS Form W-9, validly executed by such Company
Shareholder.

(c) In connection with the Closing, each Company Stock Certificate
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

(d) No certificates representing a fractional share of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock upon the
surrender for exchange of a Company Stock Certificate and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or any rights as a
holder of Parent Common Stock. In lieu of any such fractional share,

 



22  each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise have been
entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock upon surrender of a
Company Stock Certificate for exchange shall be paid upon such surrender cash
(without interest and rounded down to the nearest cent) from Parent in an
amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share
interest of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise have
been entitled by (ii) the Parent Average Closing Price. For purposes of this
_Section 2.13(d)_, all fractional shares to which a single record holder
would be entitled shall be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to
three decimal places.

Section 2.14 Certain Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective
Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class
by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares,
readjustment, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock
distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period,
the Merger Consideration and the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly
dependent items, as the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted, without
duplication, to provide the holders of Parent Common Stock and Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event.

Section 2.15 Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Transitory
Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any payments payable or otherwise deliverable to any holders
or former holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub, the Transitory Surviving
Corporation or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, is required to
deduct or withhold therefrom under the Code, or any other Applicable
Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that such
amounts are so withheld and paid to the applicable Tax Authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made.

Section 2.16 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Company with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub,
Transitory Surviving Corporation and the Company, the officers of the
Surviving Company and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger
Sub, the Transitory Surviving Corporation, the Company and otherwise) to take
such action. 

Section 2.17 Closing Working Capital Adjustment.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than twenty-
five (25) calendar days following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to be
prepared in good faith and in accordance with GAAP and the accounting
principles and policies of the Company as of the Measurement Date consistently
applied with prior periods (the " _Company Accounting Principles
and Procedures_ "), and shall deliver to the Shareholder Representative (the
" _Receiving Party_ ") (i) a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the
Companys calculation of the Closing Working Capital and (ii) reasonable
supporting detail thereof (the calculations and items set forth in the

 



23  foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) are referred to herein as the " _Working
Capital Statement_ "). Following delivery of the Working Capital Statement,
the Company shall permit the Receiving Party (and its Representatives)
reasonable access to the personnel, accountants and properties of the Company,
the Surviving Company (if applicable) and their respective Subsidiaries, and
their respective books, records, contracts and other documents of the
Company, the Surviving Company (if applicable) and their respective
Subsidiaries that are or could reasonably be relevant to the calculation of
Closing Working Capital or preparation of the Working Capital Statement. 

(b) Following the delivery of the Working Capital Statement, the Receiving
Party may dispute all or any portion of the calculation of the Closing
Working Capital set forth in the Working Capital Statement, and may deliver a
written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to Parent prior to the expiration of
the twenty-five (25) day period commencing upon receipt by the Receiving
Party of the Working Capital Statement (the " _Review Period_ "). The Dispute
Notice shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the principal basis for the
dispute of such calculation. If the Receiving Party does not deliver a
Dispute Notice prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the calculation
of the Closing Working Capital set forth in the Working Capital Statement
shall be deemed final and binding on all of the parties for all purposes of
this Agreement.

(c) If the Receiving Party delivers a Dispute Notice to Parent prior to the
expiration of the Review Period, then the Shareholder Representative and
Parent shall use good faith efforts to reach agreement on the calculation of
the Closing Working Capital and all such discussions and communications
related thereto shall be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence and any applicable similar state rule. Any items agreed to by Parent
and the Shareholder Representative in writing, together with any items or
calculations set forth in the Working Capital Statement not disputed
or objected to by the Receiving Party in the Dispute Notice, shall be final
and binding on all parties. If the Shareholder Representative and Parent are
unable to reach agreement on the calculation of the Closing Working Capital
within twenty (20) calendar days after the end of the Review Period, the
Shareholder Representative and Parent shall refer all matters that remain in
dispute (the " _Unresolved Matters_ ") to Plante and Moran PLLC (such firm, or
any successor thereto, being referred to herein as the " _Designated
Accounting Firm_ ") after such twentieth (20th) day. The Designated
Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not an arbitrator to resolve any
remaining disagreements and shall only resolve any Unresolved Matters (and not
any other matter or calculation set forth in the Working Capital Statement).
In connection with the resolution of any such Unresolved Matters by the
Designated Accounting Firm: (A) each of Parent and the Shareholder
Representative shall have one opportunity to initiate a meeting with the
Designated Accounting Firm to provide their respective views as to
any Unresolved Matters with respect to the calculation of the Closing Working
Capital ( _provided_ , that such party shall (x) provide a reasonable advance
notice to the other so that the other may have present its Representatives
and (y) provide in advance of any such meeting copies of all written
materials to be presented to the Designated Accounting Firm by such party);
(B) the Designated Accounting Firm may, at its discretion, conduct one
conference or meeting concerning the disagreement and each of Parent and the
Shareholder Representative shall have the right to have present its
Representatives; (C) the Designated Accounting Firm shall be directed to, and
shall, render its decision on the Unresolved Matters in accordance with the
Company Accounting Principles and Procedures within twenty (20) calendar days
of its engagement and, upon reaching such determination, shall deliver a copy
of its calculations of the

 



24  Unresolved Matters to the Shareholder Representative and Parent; and (D) the
Designated Accounting Firms determination as to each Unresolved Matter shall
be final and binding on all of the parties for all purposes of this
Agreement, absent manifest error. In its determination as to the Unresolved
Matters and its calculations thereof, the Designated Accounting Firm may not
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by any party in the Working Capital Statement or in the Dispute Notice
or less than the lowest value for such item claimed by any party in the
Working Capital Statement or in the Dispute Notice. The fees and expenses of
the Designated Accounting Firm shall be borne 50% by Parent, on the one hand,
and 50%, on a joint and several basis, by MJM and MTM, on the other hand.

Section 2.18 Procedure for Payment of Closing Working Capital Adjustment. If
the Closing Working Capital, as finally determined in accordance with _Section
2.17_, is less than the Working Capital Target (such deficiency, a "
_Shortfall_ "), then the Company Shareholders jointly shall deliver to the
Surviving Company cash in immediately available funds in the amount of such
Shortfall no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day after the determination
of the Closing Working Capital in accordance with _Section 2.17_. If the
Closing Working Capital, as finally determined in accordance with _Section
2.17_, is greater than the Working Capital Target (such excess, an " _Excess_
"), then Parent shall deliver to the Company Shareholders cash in immediately
available funds in the amount of such Excess (allocated among the Company
Shareholders based on their Pro Rata Share) no later than the fifth (5th)
Business Day after the determination of the Closing Working Capital in
accordance with _Section 2.17_.

ARTICLE 3.

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as set forth in the Company Registration Statement (other than forward
looking disclosures set forth in any risk factor sections, any disclosures in
any section relating to forward looking statements and any other disclosures
therein to the extent they are primarily predictive or forward-looking in
nature, in each such case, other than the factual information contained
therein) and subject to _Section 12.05_, except as set forth in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

Section 3.01 Corporate Existence and Power.

(a) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has
all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted.
The Company is, in all material respects, duly licensed and qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation and in good standing in each jurisdiction
in which the ownership or operation of its assets or the character of its
activities is such as to require it to be so licensed or qualified.

 

(b) Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership or other
Person duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and in good standing
(with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing)
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and
has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now
conducted. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is, in all material respects,
duly licensed and qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction 

 



25  in which the ownership or operation of its assets or the character of its
activities is such as to require it to be so licensed or qualified. Section
3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the name of each
Subsidiary of the Company, and with respect to the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries: (i) the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and
(ii) its ownership, including the name of each holder of an Equity Interest
in such Subsidiary and the amount of the Equity Interest in each such
Subsidiary held by such Person.

Section 3.02 Corporate Authorization _._ The Company has all necessary
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and each
Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party, to perform and comply with each
of its obligations under this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which
it is a party and, subject to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval,
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and each
Ancillary Agreement to which it is party, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, subject to the
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval. Assuming this Agreement and each
Ancillary Agreement to which the Company is a party has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by each of the other parties hereto and thereto, this
Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which the Company is a party
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject, as to
enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency and other Applicable Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and remedies and to
general equity principles. The affirmative vote or consent of the holders of
a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock is the only
vote or consent of the holders of the Company Capital Stock necessary to adopt
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which the Company is a party,
and approve the principal terms of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (the " _Company Shareholder Approval_ ").

Section 3.03 Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to
which it is a party and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby require no action by or in respect of, or
Consent of, any Governmental Authority other than (i) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger and the Subsequent Certificate of Merger with the
Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs, Bureau of Commercial Services,
Corporation Division of the State of Michigan and appropriate documents with
the relevant authorities of other states in which the Company is qualified to
do business, (ii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act,
and (iii) any actions or Consents, the absence of which would, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to materially impair the Company or
its Subsidiaries or materially impair or materially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

Section 3.04 Non-contravention _._ The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a
party and the consummation of by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby do not and will not (i) assuming the receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval, contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or
breach of any provisions of the Company Articles of Incorporation, the
Company Bylaws or the Companys other organizational documents or the

 



26  organizational documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries, (ii) assuming
compliance with the matters referred to in _Section 3.03_ and _Section
5.03_, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any
provision of any Applicable Law applicable to the Company or its Subsidiaries,
(iii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in _Section 3.03_
and  _Section 5.03_, and except as set forth on Section 3.04(iii) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, (A) require any Consent by any Person, (B)
constitute a default, or an event that, with or without notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default or (C) cause or permit the
termination, cancellation, acceleration or the loss of any benefit to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled, in each of subclauses (A)
through (C), under any provision of any Contract binding upon the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any Permit relating to the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, or (iv) result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such
contraventions, conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
materially delay the consummation of the Merger Transactions or to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.05 Capitalization.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 50,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 preferred shares, no par value ("
_Company Preferred Stock_ " and, together with Company Common Stock, the "
_Company Capital Stock_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, (i) there were
outstanding 20,753,334 shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) there were no
outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock. All outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid and nonassessable. Other than 500,000 shares of Company Common
Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company Equity Plan, there are no
options, warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of
any character to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound relating to the issued
or unissued Company Capital Stock or other Equity Interests of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to issue or sell any shares of its capital stock or other Equity Interests in
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Section 3.05(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and correct list of each holder of
the Company Common Stock and the number of shares of Company Common Stock held
by each such Person.

of the other transactions contemplated hereby (alone or in combination with
any other event) by any employee, director or shareholder of the Company who

TAX MATTERS

Section 8.01 Tax Returns. The Company Shareholders and the Shareholder
Representative shall prepare, or shall cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns
required to be filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which reflect
items of income, gain, deduction or loss that are reported on the Tax Returns
of the Company Shareholders or any other owner of the Company for any Tax
period ending on or before the Closing Date regardless of when due (such Tax
Returns, the " _Flow-Through Returns_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, the
Company Shareholders (or such other owner of the Company) shall pay all Taxes
due with respect to any items of income or gain of the Company reflected on
such Flow-Through Returns. Such Flow-Through Returns shall be prepared by
treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent

 



56  with the past practices of the Company with respect to such items, except as
required by Applicable Law (the " _Past Practice Requirement_ "). At least ten
Business Days prior to the due date (taking into account any extensions) for
filing any such Flow-Through Return, the Shareholder Representative shall
submit a copy of such Flow-Through Return to Parent for review and comment
(such comments being limited to ensuring that such Flow-Through Return is
prepared in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Past
Practice Requirement and Applicable Law) and shall consider comments in good
faith, and such Flow-Through Return shall not be filed without the consent of
Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld) in the event such Flow-Through Return
would reasonably be expected to cause a material adverse Tax consequence to
Parent or its Affiliates in a period beginning on or after the Closing Date.
For the avoidance of doubt, from and after the Closing, Parent and the
Company shall be responsible for the timely preparation of any Tax Returns of
the Company and its Subsidiaries other than Flow-Through Returns and the
payment of any Taxes with respect to such Tax Returns; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company Shareholders shall pay the portion of any such Taxes on
such Tax Returns that are payable by the Company Shareholders under (and in
satisfaction of) the indemnification provisions in _Article 11_. After the
Closing, without the consent of the Shareholder Representative not to be
unreasonably withheld, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall amend
any Flow-Through Returns or any other Tax Return of the Company or its
Subsidiaries relating to a period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to
the Closing Date. The Company Shareholders and the Shareholder Representative
shall have the right, at their sole cost and expense, to control any
audit, examination or other proceeding with respect to Flow-Through Returns
and may make all decisions taken in connection with such control; _provided_ ,
that the Company Shareholders and the Shareholder Representative shall not
settle any such audit, examination or other proceeding without the consent of
Parent not to be unreasonably withheld.

Section 8.02 Cooperation. The Shareholder Representative, the Company
Shareholders and Parent shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and
Representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax
Returns filed with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, including
maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary in
connection with Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods
relating to such Taxes. The Shareholder Representative, the Company
Shareholders and Parent shall agree (i) to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company or its Subsidiaries relating
to any Tax period beginning before the Closing Date until the applicable
statute of limitations (as may be extended) has expired and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Tax Authority; (ii) to
allow the other party and its Representatives at times and dates mutually
acceptable to the parties, to inspect, review and make copies of such records
as such party may deem necessary or appropriate from time to time, such
activities to be conducted during normal business hours at such partys
expense; and (iii) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if
the other party so requests, to allow the other party to take possession of
such books and records.

Section 8.03 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other substantially similar Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the Merger or the
Subsequent Merger (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be

 



57  paid 50% by the Company Shareholders on the one hand, and 50% by Parent, on
the other hand, and Parent and the Company Shareholders will cooperate, at
their own expense, in filing all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes and in preparing,
executing and filing any Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

Section 8.04 Refunds. Except to the extent a Tax refund or credit is taken
into account in the determination of Closing Working Capital, the amount of
any Tax refunds or credits relating to Taxes paid prior to the Closing Date
by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries for taxable periods (or
portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date or with respect to
which indemnification payments have been made by the Company Shareholders
that are actually received after the Closing Date or applied to offset any
Taxes of Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates shall be for the
account of the Company Shareholders. Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid,
to the Company Shareholders (allocated based on their respective Pro Rata
Share) the amount of such refund or credit, within ten (10) days after such
refund is received or after such credit or refund is used to offset another
Tax liability, as the case may be.

Section 8.05 Adjustment to Merger Consideration. Any payments made pursuant
to  _Section 2.18_, _Section 8.04_ or _Article 11_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by Applicable Law.

 

Section 8.06 Other Tax Matters.

(a) The Company Shareholders, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Sister Sub
intend that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) the payment of the
Company Shareholder Notes (other than the dividend payable to CenTra, Inc. in
the amount of $24,500,000, the payment of which shall be treated as in
satisfaction of the remaining balance of the dividend payable to CenTra, Inc.
declared on December 29, 2006) shall be treated as the repayment of
promissory notes previously distributed by the Company to the holder thereof
(or its assignor if applicable) and (ii) the Merger and the Subsequent Merger,
taken together as a single integrated transaction shall be treated as
a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code (to which each of Parent
and the Company are to be parties under Section 368(b) of the Code) in which
the Company is treated as merging directly with and into Parent, with
the Company Common Stock converted in such merger into the Merger
Consideration. Each party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, treat the
Merger and Subsequent Merger for all Tax purposes consistent with this
_Section 8.06_ unless required to do otherwise by Applicable Law.

(b) The Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Sister Sub hereby adopt this Agreement
as a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a).

(c) Parent and the Company will (i) use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Merger and the Subsequent Merger to constitute a reorganization under Section
368(a) of the Code and (ii) not take any action after the date hereof that
could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Merger and the
Subsequent Merger from qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of

65 Section 11.04 Claims and Procedures.

 

(a) In order for any Person to be entitled to seek indemnification under this
_Article 11_ (an " _Indemnitee_ "), such Indemnitee shall deliver a written
certificate signed by any officer or director of the Indemnitee (or if the
Indemnitee is an individual Person, signed by the Indemnitee) (any certificate
delivered in accordance with the provisions of this  _Section 11.04(a)_, a "
_Claim Certificate_ ") to the party from whom such indemnification is sought
(the " _Indemnitor_ "), as promptly as reasonably practicable after it
acquires knowledge of the fact, event or circumstance giving rise to the
claim for Damages (and in any event, no later than twenty (20) Business Days
after written notice of such claim is delivered to the Indemnitee if such
claim is a Third Party Claim (as defined below)), specifying in reasonable
detail (to the extent known) the nature of, the facts and legal basis for, the
amount (if known) of, such claim asserted, and the provisions of this
Agreement upon which such claim for indemnification is made. Failure to
deliver a Claim Certificate in compliance with this _Section 11.04_ in a
timely manner as specified in the immediately preceding sentence shall not be
deemed a waiver of the Indemnitees right to indemnification hereunder for
Damages in connection with such claim except to the extent the Indemnitor
shall have been prejudiced as a result of such failure. The Claim Certificate
shall:

(i) state that the applicable Indemnitee has a claim for indemnification
pursuant to this _Article 11_ and expressly identify the provisions of this
Agreement upon which such claim for indemnification is made in reasonable
detail (including the specific representations, warranties and/or covenants
that are alleged to be inaccurate or alleged to have been breached);

 

(ii) to the extent possible, contain a good faith non-binding, preliminary
estimate of the amount to which such Indemnitee claims to be entitled to
receive, which shall be the amount of Damages such Indemnitee claims to have
incurred or suffered or could reasonably be expected to incur or suffer; and

 

(iii) specify in reasonable detail (based upon the information then possessed
by Indemnitee) the facts known to the Indemnitee giving rise to such claim.

(b) As promptly as practicable after delivery of a Claim Certificate to an
Indemnitor, the Indemnitee which has provided such Claim Certificate shall
supply and make available to the Indemnitor all relevant information in its or
its Affiliates possession relating to the claim identified in such Claim
Certificate (except to the extent that such action would result in a loss of
attorney-client privilege or protections of the work product doctrine;
_provided_ , that such Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide such information in such format to the Indemnitor, or on an outside
counsel only basis, in a manner which would not result in the loss of such
attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine) and shall cooperate with
the Indemnitor. Without limiting the foregoing, such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the Indemnitors request) the provision to the
Indemnitor of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such
claim, and making employees and other representatives and advisors available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder.

 



66 Section 11.05 No Contribution. No Controlling Shareholder shall have, or
be entitled to exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), and

of indemnity against Transitory Surviving Corporation, Sister Sub, or the
Surviving Company in connection with any indemnification obligation under
_Article 11_ of this Agreement.

Section 11.06 Defense of Third-Party Claims.

(a) Indemnitor shall have the right, but not the obligation, upon written
notice to the Indemnitee within twenty (20) Business Days following receipt
of notice thereof, to investigate, contest, assume the defense of (with
counsel reasonably selected by the Indemnitor) or settle any claim or demand
made, or any action, Proceeding or investigation instituted, by any Person
not a party to this Agreement for which the Indemnitee has sought
indemnification pursuant to this _Article 11_ (a " _Third Party Claim_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitee may, at its option and at its
own expense, participate in the investigation, contesting, defense or
settlement of any such Third Party Claim through Representatives and counsel
of its own choosing; and, _provided_ _further_ ,  _however_ , that the
Indemnitor shall not settle any Third Party Claim unless (i) such settlement
is on exclusively monetary terms and the Indemnitor shall pay or cause to be
paid all amounts arising out of such settlement either concurrently or with
the effectiveness thereof, (ii) such settlement includes a complete and
irrevocable release executed by all Persons who brought such Third Party
Claim, which release shall release the Indemnitee from liability or (iii) the
Indemnitor obtains the written consent of the Indemnitee. Indemnitor shall not
be liable to the Indemnitee for legal or other fees and expenses incurred by
the Indemnitee in connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim; 
_provided_ that the Indemnitor shall be liable for the reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of one national counsel and one
reasonable local counsel employed by the Indemnitee for (x) any period
commencing ten (10) Business Days following Indemnitors receipt of a Claim
Certificate with respect to the matter for which indemnification is being
sought by the Indemnitee, during which the Indemnitor has failed to assume the
defense thereof pursuant to this _Section 11.06(a)_ and (y) for any period
during which there exists an actual conflict of interest (based on written
advice of counsel) by the representation of the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee
by the same counsel (it being understood, however, that for purposes of
clause (y), the Indemnitor shall control such defense). Whether or not the
Indemnitor shall have assumed the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnitee shall not settle, compromise, discharge or pay any Third Party
Claim for which it seeks indemnification hereunder without the prior written
consent of the Indemnitor.

(b) The Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in (but not to control)
the defense of any Third Party Claim which it has not elected to assume the
defense of with its own counsel and at its own expense.

 

(c) Parent and the Company Shareholders, as applicable, shall make available
to each other all relevant information in their possession relating to any
Third Party Claim (except to the extent that such action would result in a
loss of attorney-client privilege; _provided_ , that they shall each use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide such information in such format to
the 

 



67  other, or on an outside counsel only basis, in a manner which would not
result in the loss of such attorney-client privilege) and shall cooperate with
each other in the defense thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnitors request)
the provision to the Indemnitor of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees and other
Representatives and advisors available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
of any Third Party Claim in respect of Taxes or a Tax Return with respect to
which the Company Shareholders and/or MJM may have an indemnification
obligation pursuant to this Article 11 (a " _Tax Claim_ "), the Company
Shareholders and MJM shall be entitled at their sole cost and expense to
control any such Tax Claim and may make all decisions taken in connection
with such control; _provided_ , that the Company Shareholders and MJM shall
not settle or otherwise resolve any such Tax Claim without the consent of
Parent not to be unreasonably withheld. Furthermore, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, this _Section 11.06_ shall not apply to
any audit, examination or other proceeding with respect to any Flow-Through
Returns, control of which shall be governed exclusively by _Section 8.01_. 

Section 11.07 Exercise of Remedies by Indemnitees Other Than Parent or
Shareholder Representative. No Indemnitee (other than Parent, Shareholder
Representative or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall be permitted
to assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this
Agreement unless Parent or Shareholder Representative, respectively (or any
successor thereto or assign thereof) shall have consented to the assertion of
such indemnification claim or the exercise of such other remedy.

Section 11.08 Mitigation. Each Indemnitee shall take commercially reasonable
steps to mitigate all Damages after becoming aware of any event which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Damages that are indemnifiable
hereunder. In the event that an Indemnitor makes any payment to any Indemnitee
for indemnification for which such Indemnitee could have collected on a claim
against a third party (including under any contract and any insurance
claims), the Indemnitor shall (at its own sole cost and expense) be entitled
to pursue claims and conduct litigation on behalf of such Indemnitee and any
of its successors, to pursue and collect on any indemnification or other
remedy available to such Indemnitee thereunder with respect to such claim and
generally to be subrogated to the rights of such Indemnitee. The Indemnitee
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) to, cooperate with the Indemnitor, at the Indemnitors sole
cost and expense, with respect to any such effort to pursue and collect with
respect thereto.

Section 11.09 Net of Tax Benefits. The amount of Damages for which
indemnification is provided under this Article 11 shall be reduced to take
into account any net Tax benefit actually realized (determined on a with and
without basis) by the Indemnitee arising from the incurrence or payment of any
such Damages or the circumstances related thereto, in each case, in the tax
year that includes the incurrence or payment. If any such net Tax benefits
are actually realized after the applicable indemnity payment has been made,
the Indemnitee shall make a payment to the Indemnitor in an amount equal to
such net Tax benefit within 10 Business Days after such net Tax benefit is
actually realized.

 



68 Section 11.10 Sole Remedy. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and
agrees that, from and after the Closing, absent fraud, its sole and exclusive
remedy with respect to any and all claims relating (directly or indirectly) to
the subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
regardless of the legal theory under which such liability or obligation may
be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at
law or in equity, or otherwise, shall be the indemnification provisions
contained in this _Article 11_ , which are intended to provide the sole and
exclusive remedy of the parties following the Closing as to all Damages any
Indemnitee may incur arising from or relating to this Agreement, the Merger or
Merger Transactions, and absent fraud, the parties shall have no other remedy
or recourse with respect to any of the foregoing, other than pursuant to this
_Article 11_ (it being understood that nothing in this _Article 11_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall affect the parties rights to specific
performance or other equitable remedies to enforce the covenants referred to
in this Agreement that are to be performed after the Closing).

Section 12.03 Amendments, Extensions and Waivers.

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended, extended with respect to
the time for performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
parties, or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such
amendment, extension or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an
amendment or extension, by each party hereto, which in the case of Parent
shall require the written approval of the Special Committee (in the case of
an amendment, extension or waiver prior to the Effective Time) or the Audit
Committee (in the case of an amendment, extension or waiver following the
Effective Time).

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power, remedy or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power, remedy or privilege. The rights and
remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights
or remedies provided by Applicable Law.

 

Section 12.04 Expenses _._ Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, including all third-party legal, accounting, financial advisory,
consulting or other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger
Transactions and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall
be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

Section 12.05 Disclosure Schedule References _._ The parties hereto agree
that any matter or reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be an exception to
(or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are
contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (ii) any other
representations and warranties of such party that is contained in this
Agreement if the relevance of that matter or reference as an exception to (or
a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties would be
reasonably apparent to a person who has read that matter or reference and
such representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable).

Section 12.06 Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment; Parent Actions.

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns. Except with respect to

 



74   _Section 7.07_, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any
rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any
Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer, in whole or in
part, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, and any such
purported assignment, delegation or transfer shall be null and void and
without any force or effect, in each such case, without the prior written

(c) The parties acknowledge that the charter of the Audit Committee requires
the Audit Committee to review the material facts of any proposed related

Section 12.07 Arbitration; Governing Law.

 

(a) Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereunder or a breach thereof (each, a
"Dispute") shall be resolved by binding and confidential arbitration. Parent,
on the one hand, and the Company Shareholders and MJM, on the other hand, may
initiate arbitration under this _Section 12.07_ by filing a written
arbitration demand with the regional office of the American Arbitration
Association (" _AAA_ ") closest to Warren, Michigan and contemporaneously
providing a copy of such demand to the other party at the applicable
address(es) provided in _Section 12.02_. The arbitration shall be governed
by and conducted pursuant to the AAAs Commercial Arbitration Rules, including
the Procedures for Large, Complex Commercial Disputes and the Optional Rules
for Emergency Measures of Protection; _provided_ __, _however_ , there shall
be three arbitrators. One arbitrator will be selected by each of Parent, on
the one hand, and the Company Stockholders, on the other hand, promptly (and
in any event, within fifteen (15) Business Days of the receipt of a notice of
arbitration demand) (which arbitrator must be an Eligible Arbitrator) and the
two Eligible Arbitrators selected by such parties shall promptly (and in any
event, within five (5) Business Days after the initial two Eligible
Arbitrators have been selected) select a third Eligible Arbitrator from the
American Arbitration Associations Large, Complex Commercial Case Panel. Any
arbitrator not timely appointed by the parties or otherwise under this
_Section 12.07_ shall be appointed by the AAA in accordance with the listing,
ranking and striking method in the Rules, and in any such procedure, each of
Parent, on the one hand, and the Company Shareholders and MJM, on the other
hand, shall be given up to three (3) peremptory strikes and an unlimited
number of strikes for cause. Any controversy concerning whether a Dispute is
arbitrable, whether arbitration has been waived, whether a party to or
assignee of this Agreement is bound to arbitrate, or as to the interpretation,
applicability or enforceability of this _Section 12.07_ shall be determined
by the arbitrators. The place of the arbitration shall be Warren, Michigan,
or at a location mutually agreed upon by the parties. Except as may be
required by Applicable Law and for communications among the parties and their
respective counsel (and persons retained by counsel for the purpose of
assisting in any proceeding, who shall agree to be bound by a reasonable
confidentiality agreement), all arbitration proceedings commenced hereunder
shall be confidential.

 



75 (b) This Agreement will be governed by, and in the event of any arbitration,
the arbitrators will apply, the substantive law (and the law of remedies, if
applicable) of the State of Michigan without giving effect to the principles
of conflicts of law that would require the application of the laws of any
other jurisdiction.

 

(c) In the event the Dispute involves (i) valuation of a liability under this
Agreement, (ii) an amount in controversy in a Dispute, or (iii) an amount of
Damages following a determination of liability, the arbitration shall proceed
in the following manner: Each of Parent, on the one hand, and the Company
Shareholders and MJM, on the other hand, shall submit to the arbitration
panel constituted in accordance with this _Section 12.07_, and exchange with
each other, on a schedule to be determined by the arbitrators, a proposed
valuation, amount or calculation of Damages (each, a " _Proposal_ "), as the
case may be, together with a statement setting forth such partys explanation
as to why its Proposal is accurate, along with all supporting documents or
other evidence upon which such statement relies. The arbitration panel,
within thirty (30) Business Days of receiving such Proposals, statements and
supporting documents or other evidence, shall choose between the Proposals and
shall be limited to awarding only one of the Proposals submitted.
The arbitration panel shall supply a reasoned written opinion supporting its
determination. Such determination shall be final and binding on the parties to
such arbitration and there shall be no right of appeal therefrom.

 

(d) Each party shall pay its own fees and expenses for the arbitration and the
fees and expenses of the arbitrators shall be equally shared by the parties.

(e) Any arbitration proceeding shall be concluded in a maximum of three (3)
months from the commencement of the arbitration. The parties involved in the
proceeding may agree in writing (at each partys discretion) to extend the
arbitration period if necessary to appropriately resolve the controversy,
claim or alleged breach. 

(f) Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the parties will continue to honor all
other commitments under this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement during
the course of arbitration pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 12.07_
with respect to all matters not subject to such arbitration.

 

(g) The arbitrators may consolidate an arbitration under this Agreement with
any arbitration arising under or relating to the Ancillary Agreements (other
than the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement) or any other
agreement between the parties entered into pursuant hereto, as the case may
be, if the subject of the controversy, claim or alleged breach arises out of
or relates essentially to the same set of facts or transactions. Such
consolidated arbitration shall be determined by the arbitrator appointed for
the arbitration proceeding that was commenced first in time and shall be
subject to the provisions of  _Section 12.07(a)_.

(h) In the event that preliminary or permanent injunctive relief is necessary
or desirable in order to prevent a party from acting contrary to this
Agreement or to prevent irreparable harm while an arbitration proceeding is
pending or an award is subject to confirmation or enforcement, then each of
Parent, Sister Sub and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company and the
Company Shareholders and MJM, on the other hand, is authorized and entitled to
commence a lawsuit solely to obtain equitable relief against the other pending
the 

 



76  completion of the arbitration in a court having jurisdiction over the
parties. Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) submits, for
itself and its property, to, and (ii) hereby consents to, the jurisdiction of
the federal and state courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts) for the
State of Michigan, Macomb County, for such purpose. Process in any action or
proceeding referred to in the preceding sentence may be served on any party
anywhere in the world, and each of the parties hereto agrees that service of
process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at the
applicable address set forth in _Section 12.02_ above shall be effective
service of process for any such action or proceeding. Each party agrees that
(x) it will not attempt to deny or defeat personal jurisdiction or venue in
any such court by motion or otherwise, and (y) it will not bring any action
relating to this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than any such court.

Section 12.08 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION,
PROCEEDING, ARBITRATION, CLAIM OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE ACTIONS OF
PARENT, SISTER SUB, MERGER SUB, THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY SHAREHOLDERS, MJM
AND/OR THE SHAREHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE IN THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 12.09 Shareholder Representative.

 

(a) Each of the Company Shareholders hereby appoints (and by his execution of
this Agreement as Shareholder Representative, Matthew T. Moroun hereby
accepts his appointment) as the true, exclusive and lawful agent and attorney-
in-fact, of the Company Shareholders to act in the name, place and stead of
the Company Shareholders in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, and to act on behalf of the Company Shareholders in any Proceeding
or Dispute involving this Agreement, to do or refrain from doing all such
further acts and things, and to execute all such documents on behalf of the
Company Shareholders as the Shareholder Representative shall deem necessary or
appropriate in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the power:

 

(i) to act for the Company Shareholders with regard to matters pertaining to
indemnification referred to in this Agreement, including the power to
compromise any indemnity claim on behalf of the Company Shareholders and to
transact matters of arbitration or other Proceedings;

 

(ii) to execute and deliver all amendments, waivers, Ancillary Agreements,
stock powers, certificates and documents that the Shareholder Representative
deems necessary or appropriate in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



77 (iii) to execute and deliver all amendments and waivers to this
Agreement that the Shareholder Representative deems necessary or appropriate,
whether prior to, at or after the Closing;

 

(iv) to receive funds for the payment of expenses of the Company Shareholders
and apply such funds in payment for such expenses; and

(v) to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of the
Company Shareholders that the Shareholder Representative deems necessary or
appropriate in his sole discretion relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement as fully and completely as the Company Shareholders could do if
personally present.

 

(b) The Shareholder Representative may be removed or replaced only upon
delivery of written notice to Parent by each of the Company Shareholders.
Parent, the Surviving Company and any other Person may conclusively and
absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any written instrument delivered by the
Shareholder Representative in all matters referred to herein. No bond shall
be required of the Shareholder Representative, and the Shareholder
Representative shall not receive compensation for its, his or her services;
provided, that the Shareholder Representative shall be entitled to
reimbursements of expenses pursuant to  _Section 12.09(d)_. The Shareholder
Representative shall act for the Company Shareholders on all of the matters
set forth in this Agreement in the manner the Shareholder Representative
believes to be in the best interest of the Company Shareholders and
consistent with the obligations under this Agreement, but the Shareholder
Representative shall not be responsible or liable to the Company Shareholders
for any Damages the Company Shareholders may suffer by the performance of
its duties under this Agreement, other than Damage arising from willful
misconduct in the performance of his, her or its duties under this Agreement.
The Shareholder Representative shall incur no liability to the Company
Shareholders with respect to any action taken, omitted to be taken or
suffered by them in reliance upon any notice, direction, instruction, consent,
statement or other documents believed by him, her or it to be genuinely and
duly authorized, nor for any other action or inaction except its own willful
misconduct. The Shareholder Representative may, in all questions arising under
this Agreement, or any other agreement, rely on the advice of counsel and the
Shareholder Representative shall not be liable to the Company Shareholders
for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the Shareholder
Representative based on such advice. The Shareholder Representative is
authorized by the Company Shareholders to incur expenses on behalf of the
Company Shareholders in acting hereunder. The parties hereto understand and
agree that the Shareholder Representative is acting solely on behalf of and as
agent for the Company Shareholders and not in his or her personal capacity.

 

(c) Each Company Shareholder agrees to indemnify the Shareholder
Representative for its respective Pro Rata Share of any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel
retained by the Shareholder Representative) or disbursements of any kind or
nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on or incurred by the
Shareholder Representative in any way relating to or arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Shareholder
Representatives duties hereunder or this Agreement or any documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof
or thereof; provided, however, that no Company Shareholder shall be liable
for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the Shareholder
Representatives willful misconduct.

 



78 (d) All reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses, including legal fees
and expenses and fees, in each such case, incurred by the Shareholder
Representative in fulfilling the duties of the Shareholder Representative as
agent for the Company Shareholders hereunder shall be paid or reimbursed by
the Company Shareholders based on their Pro Rata Share. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Shareholder Representative is authorized to
deduct from any payment due to the Company Shareholders pursuant to this
Agreement the amount of any reimbursement.

 

Section 12.10 Counterparts _._ This Agreement may be executed by the parties
by facsimile or electronic mail transmission in Portable Document Format
(.pdf) and in any number of separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall
together constitute one and the same instrument.

 

Section 12.11 Entire Agreement _._ This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. 

Section 12.12 Severability _._ If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction, or under
Applicable Law, to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon
such a determination that any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is invalid, void or unenforceable, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 12.13 Specific Performance.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that any breach of this
Agreement would not be adequately compensated by monetary damages. Except as
otherwise set forth in this  _Section 12.13_, including the limitations set
forth herein, the parties acknowledge and agree that, prior to the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01_, the parties shall in the event
of any breach or threatened breach by the Company or Company Shareholders, on
the one hand, or Parent, Merger Sub or Sister Sub, on the other hand, of any
of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the
Company and the Company Shareholders, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub
and Sister Sub, on the other hand, shall to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law, be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other, as
applicable, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to

 



79  enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other under
this Agreement, without proof of actual damage or inadequacy of legal remedy.
The pursuit of specific enforcement by any party hereto shall not be deemed
to be an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right
or remedy to which such party may be entitled.

(b) Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

(c) Each of the Company and the Company Shareholders, on the one hand, and
Parent, Sister Sub and Merger Sub, on the other hand, hereby agrees not to
raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement by the other party(ies), as applicable, and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
such party under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 12.13_. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with such order or injunction in accordance with
the terms of this _Section 12.13_. Each party further agrees that (i) by
seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section 12.13_, a party shall not
in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be
available to such party under this Agreement in the event that this Agreement
has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this
_Section 12.13_ are not available or otherwise are not granted and (ii)
nothing set forth in this _Section 12.13_ shall require any party hereto to
institute any proceeding for (or limit any partys right to institute any
proceeding for) specific performance hereunder prior to, or as a condition to,
exercising any termination right under _Article 10_ (and pursuing damages
after such termination in accordance with this Agreement), nor shall the
commencement of any arbitration or legal proceeding pursuant to _Section
12.07_ or this _Section 12.13_ or anything set forth in _Section 12.07_ or
this  _Section 12.13_ restrict or limit any partys right thereafter to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article 10_ or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter. 

Section 12.14 Provision Respecting Legal Representation. It is acknowledged by
each of the parties hereto that (a) each of the Company, the Company
Shareholders, MJM and the Shareholder Representative has retained Simpson
Thacher and Bartlett LLP (" _STB_ ") and Mitchell, Williams, Selig, Gates and
Woodyard, P.L.L.C. (" _Mitchell, Williams_ ") to act as its counsel in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) Parent has
retained STB to act as its antitrust counsel in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, including in connection with making an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form or Forms pursuant to the
HSR Act. Parent, Sister Sub, Merger Sub, the Company, the Company
Shareholders, MJM and the Shareholder Representative (i) have each waived any
conflict inherent in the representations set forth in the preceding sentence,
and (ii) hereby agree that, in the event that a dispute arises after the
Closing between Parent, the Transitory Surviving Corporation and/or
the Surviving Company, on the one hand, and the Company Shareholders, MJM
and/or the Shareholder Representative, on the other hand, each of STB and
Mitchell,

 



80  Williams may represent any or all of the Company Shareholders, MJM and/or
the Shareholder Representative in such dispute even though the interests of
the Company Shareholders, MJM and/or the Shareholder Representative may be
directly adverse to Parent, the Transitory Surviving Corporation and the
Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and even though (x)
STB represents Parent in connection with antitrust matters related to the
transactions contemplated and (y) STB and Mitchell, Williams formerly may have
represented the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially
related to such dispute. Parent further agrees that, in connection with any
future dispute between Parent, the Transitory Surviving Corporation and the
Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and
any of the Company Shareholders, MJM the Shareholder Representative or their
respective Affiliates, on the other hand, with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as to all communications among STB, Mitchell,
Williams, the Company, any of its or Subsidiaries and any Company
Shareholders, MJM or the Shareholder Representative that relate in any way to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege
and the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Company Shareholder,
MJM or Shareholder Representative, as the case may be, and may be controlled
by the Company Shareholder, MJM or Shareholder Representative, as the case may
be, and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent, the Transitory Surviving
Corporation and the Surviving Company or any of its or their Subsidiaries.
