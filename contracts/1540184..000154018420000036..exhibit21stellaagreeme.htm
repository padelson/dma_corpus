("Parent"), Steely Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), StellaService Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a

of the Holders (the "Representative"). All capitalized terms that are used but
not defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have each unanimously determined that it is advisable and in the best
interests of each corporation and their respective stockholders that Parent

subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger") upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements, and in furtherance thereof, have approved this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Related Agreements (the "Transactions").

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, as more fully set forth
herein, in connection with the Transactions.

WHEREAS, a portion of the Total Consideration otherwise payable by Parent to
the Holders in connection with the Transactions shall be held back by Parent
as partial security for the indemnification obligations set forth in this
Agreement which holdback shall be governed by the terms and conditions hereof.

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
material inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement, each
Stockholder listed on Annex B (each, a "Major Stockholder") has executed and
delivered to Parent a Joinder Agreement in the form set forth in Exhibit A (a
"Joinder Agreement") which is to become effective at the Effective Time.

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
material inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement, each
Key Employee is accepting an offer letter from Parent, which includes a non-
competition and a non-solicitation provision (collectively, the "Key Employee
Offer Letters"), and each of which is to become effective at the Effective
Time.

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent is entering into an agreement with respect to a RandW Insurance Policy to
be obtained in connection with the Transactions contemplated hereby.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and other
promises set forth herein, the mutual benefits to be gained by the performance
thereof, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and

hereby agree as follows: THE MERGER

respect thereto in accordance with Section 1.6(b), as and when such deliveries
are required to be made; provided that each outstanding share of Company
Restricted Stock will be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration
(for the avoidance of doubt, Company Restricted Stock that accelerates and
vests immediately prior to the Effective Time will be treated as Company
Common Stock for purposes of this Agreement);

(E)with respect to each unexpired, unexercised and outstanding Vested Company
Option (which shall not be assumed by Parent and will, by virtue of the Merger
and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the Optionholder thereof, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, be
cancelled in exchange for the right to receive): (1) the Closing Per Option
Amount, (2) the portion of the Holdback Amount, if any, required to be
delivered to the Holder of such Vested Company Option with respect thereto in
accordance with Section 7.4(f), as and Representative Expense Fund, if any, required to be delivered to the Holder of
such Vested Company Option with respect thereto in accordance with Section
1.6(b), as and when such deliveries are required to be made; and

(F)with respect to each unexpired, unexercised and outstanding in-the-money
Company Warrant (which shall not be assumed by Parent and will, by virtue of

Effective Time, be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive): (1) the
Closing Per Warrant Amount, (2) the portion of the Holdback Amount, if any,

any, required to be delivered to the Holder of such Company Warrant with
respect thereto in accordance with Section 1.6(b), as and when such deliveries
are required to be made.

"Merger Consideration" shall mean all of the amounts payable pursuant to
Sections 1.6(b)(i)(A) through 1.6(b)(i)(F). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the portion of the consideration that constitutes the
Holdback Amount and the Representative Expense Fund and otherwise would be
payable at the Closing to each holder of Company Capital Stock, each holder of
Vested Company Options and each holder of Company Warrants, if any, pursuant
to Sections 1.6(b)(i)(A) through 1.6(b)(i)(F) shall be withheld at the Closing
and (1) held back by Parent pursuant to Section 1.8(b)(iii) and (2) deemed
deposited into the Representative Expense Fund pursuant to Section 1.8(b)(iv),
which amounts will be distributed to the Holders in accordance with, and
subject to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Paying Agent
Agreement, as applicable.

(ii)Cancelled Shares; Company Options; Company Warrants.

(A)Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the respective stockholders
thereof, each share of Company Capital Stock that is issued and outstanding
and held by the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
("Cancelled Shares") shall be cancelled without any consideration paid
therefor. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will assume any Company
Options or Company Warrants.

(B)At the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any Vested Company Options, each
Vested Company Option that is outstanding, unexpired and unexercised as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled in exchange for the
right to receive the consideration set forth in Section 1.6(b)(i)(E). The
Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to cause each Vested
Company Option and the Plan to be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective
Time such that immediately following the Closing, they shall no longer
represent any equity or other interest in the Company other than the right to
receive payment of any amounts due in accordance with this Agreement following
the Effective Time. The Company and the Company Board (and any applicable
committee thereof) shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all actions as are
reasonably necessary in order to effectuate the terms of this Section
1.6(b)(ii)(B) and to ensure that no holder of Company Options shall have any
rights from and after the Effective Time with respect to any such Company
Options except as expressly provided in this Section 1.6(b)(ii)(B); provided,
that such actions shall expressly be conditioned upon the consummation of the
Merger and shall be of no force or effect if this Agreement is terminated
prior to the Closing. Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any Unvested Company Options, each
Unvested Company Option that is outstanding, unexpired and unexercised as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled without the payment
of any consideration in respect of such cancelled Unvested Company Option.

(D)At the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any Company Warrants, each in the
money Company Warrant that is outstanding, unexpired and unexercised as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled in exchange for the
right to receive the consideration set forth in Section 1.6(b)(i)(F). The
Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to cause each Company
Warrant to be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time pursuant to
its terms or an agreement with the holder thereof such that immediately
following the Closing, they shall no longer represent any equity or other
interest in the Company other than the right to receive payment of any amounts
due, if any, in accordance with this Agreement following the Effective Time.
The Company and the Company Board (and any applicable committee thereof)
shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all actions as are reasonably
necessary in order to effectuate the terms of this Section 1.6(b)(ii)(D) and
to ensure that no holder of Company Warrants shall have any rights from and
after the Effective Time with respect to any such Company Warrants except as
expressly provided in this Section 1.6(b)(ii)(D); provided, that such actions
shall expressly be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and shall
be of no force or effect if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing.

(iii)Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement
to the contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and with respect to which the holder thereof has
properly demanded appraisal rights in accordance with Delaware Law, and who
has not effectively withdrawn or lost such holder's appraisal rights under
Delaware Law (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted
into or represent a right to receive the applicable consideration for Company
Capital Stock set forth in Section 1.6(b)(i) but the holder thereof shall only
be entitled to such rights as are provided by Delaware Law. Notwithstanding
the provisions of this Section 1.6(b)(iii), if any holder of Dissenting Shares
shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise)
such holder's appraisal rights under Delaware Law, then, as of the later of
the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder's shares
shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive,
upon delivery of a properly executed Letter of Transmittal and surrender of
such holder's Company Stock Certificate, if applicable, representing such
shares, upon the terms set forth in this Section 1.6 and throughout this
Agreement (including the indemnification and holdback provisions set forth in
this Agreement), the consideration for Company Capital Stock set forth in
Section 1.6(b)(i) without interest thereon. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall give Parent prompt notice and a copy of any written demand for appraisal
received by the Company and/or any of its Affiliates pursuant to the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law. After the Closing, Parent shall give
the Representative prompt notice of any written demand for appraisal received
by Parent and/or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation)
pursuant to the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Neither Parent nor any
of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation), on the one hand, nor
the Representative, on the other hand, shall make or cause to be made any
payment with respect to any such demands or offer to settle or settle any such
demands without the prior written consent of the other party, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. After the Closing, any
communication to be made by Parent and/or any of its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation), on the one hand, and the Representative, on the other
hand, to any such demanding Stockholder with respect to such demands shall be
submitted to the other party in advance and shall not be presented to any such
demanding Stockholder prior to such Person unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
from and after such time that the Indemnifying Parties no longer have
indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(iv), none of Parent or
its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) shall have any obligation
to notify, communicate with or otherwise seek the approval of the
Representative, and no approval of the Representative shall be required,
pursuant to this Section 1.6(b)(iii).

1.7Calculation. For purposes of calculating the amount of cash payable to each
Holder pursuant to this Agreement, including for purposes of calculating each
Holder's respective portions of the Holdback Amount and for the amounts placed
into the Representative Expense Fund, (i) the consideration payable in respect
of all shares of Company Capital Stock (excluding Dissenting Shares) held by
each Stockholder shall be calculated on a certificate-by-certificate basis and
(ii) the consideration payable in respect of Company Options shall be
calculated on a grant-by-grant basis; provided, however, that in no event
shall the maximum amount of cash payable to all Holders pursuant to this
Agreement exceed the Total Consideration; provided, further, that any
Transaction Payroll Taxes owing by the Company with respect to amounts payable
in respect of Company Common Stock and/or Company Options pursuant to Section
1.6 shall reduce the amounts payable on a certificate-by certificate basis or
a grant-by-grant basis, as applicable.

1.8Payment of Merger Consideration for Company Capital Stock.

(a)Paying Agent. Wilmington Trust, National Association, a national
association, or any financial institution selected by Parent in its sole
discretion (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), shall serve as the Paying Agent (the "Paying Agent") for the
Merger pursuant to the terms of the Paying Agent Agreement. Parent and the
Company shall cooperate and shall deliver all materials to the Paying Agent as
required under the Paying Agent Agreement or otherwise reasonably requested by
the Paying Agent in connection with the performance of its duties under the
Paying Agent Agreement.

(b)Parent Closing Payments.

(i)At the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time) to, pay to the
Paying Agent the amount of cash payable to the Holders at the Closing pursuant
to Section 1.6(b)(i) and as set forth on the Payment Spreadsheet in respect of
all shares of Company Capital Stock and Company Warrants held by such Holder
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(ii)At the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time)
to, pay to the Surviving Corporation in respect of all Vested Company Options
the amount of cash payable to the Holders at the Closing pursuant to Section
1.6(b)(i) and as set forth on the Payment Spreadsheet in respect of all Vested
Company Options held by such Holders outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time. For purposes of clarity, the Closing Per Option Amount
with respect to each Vested Company Option shall be paid through the Surviving
Corporation's payroll system on the first (1st) or the second (2nd) normal
payroll date of the Company following the Effective Time, and the portion of
the Holdback Amount and Representative Expense Fund entitled to be distributed
to holders of Vested Company Options shall be paid to the Company for the
benefit of the holders of Vested Company Options and shall be paid to such
holders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions with respect to
Vested Company Options through the Surviving Corporation's payroll system on
the first (1st) or the second (2nd) normal payroll receipt of such funds to be distributed to such holders of Vested Company
Options.

(iii)At the Closing, Parent shall be entitled to retain the Holdback Amount in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and each Holder shall be deemed to
have contributed such Holder's Aggregate Pro Rata Portion of the Holdback
Amount. The Holdback Amount shall constitute partial security for the
indemnification obligations of such Stockholder pursuant to Article VII and
shall be held and distributed in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement.

(iv)On the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time) to, pay the
Representative Expense Amount to the Representative to hold (the
"Representative Expense Fund") under the terms of this Agreement. The
Representative Expense Fund will be used for the purposes of paying directly,
or reimbursing the Representative for, any Representative Expenses pursuant to
this Agreement and the Related Agreements. The Holders will not receive any
interest or earnings on the Representative Expense Fund and irrevocably
transfer and assign to the Representative any ownership right that they may
otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The Representative will
not be liable for any loss of principal of the Representative Expense Fund
other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Representative will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will
not use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes
and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the
event of bankruptcy. Upon deposit of the Representative Expense Amount with
the Representative in accordance with this Section 1.8(b)(iv), for all
purposes Parent shall be deemed to have paid each Holder's Aggregate Pro Rata
Portion of the Representative Expense Fund (and Parent shall have no further
liability with respect thereto) and then each such Holder shall be deemed to
have voluntarily contributed such amount to the Representative Expense Fund.
Any withholding in respect of such deemed contribution shall be satisfied from
the Merger Consideration owing to the Holder on the Closing Date and, for the
avoidance of doubt, the amount of the Representative Expense Fund (if any)
that is returned to the Holders shall not again be subject to information
reporting or withholding.

(c)Payment Spreadsheet. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing,
the Company shall deliver to Parent a payment spreadsheet file (the "Payment

avoidance of doubt, may be specified on one or multiple tabs):

(d)Payment Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing,
and in any event within two (2) Business Days thereafter, the Paying Agent
shall mail a letter of transmittal in the form set forth in Exhibit C (a
"Letter of Transmittal") and any applicable Tax forms that the Paying Agent
may reasonably require in connection therewith (collectively, the "Exchange
Documents") to the record address of each holder of Company Capital Stock and
Company Warrants; provided, that, (i) any electronic mailing shall satisfy the
delivery requirement herein and (ii) the Exchange Documents shall be provided
to any Major Stockholder at least three (3) calendar days prior to the Closing
Date and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay on the Closing Date any
amount owed to a Major Stockholder that completes and returns the Exchange
Documents at least two (2) days prior to the Closing Date. Each holder of
Company Capital Stock or Company Warrants shall deliver to the Paying Agent
properly executed Exchange Documents, and, with respect to each Stockholder,
if such shares of Company Capital Stock are held in certificated form, a
certificate representing the relevant shares of Company Capital Stock (the
"Company Stock Certificates"). After receipt of duly executed and properly
completed Exchange Documents, the Paying Agent shall promptly (but in no event
more than two (2) Business Days after receipt of the properly completed
Exchange Documents) pay to each such Holder that has delivered to the Paying
Agent duly executed and completed Exchange Documents, together with the
corresponding Company Stock Certificates, if applicable, an amount equal to
the amount of cash to which such holder is entitled under Section 1.6 to the
accounts designated by such Holder in such Holder's Letter of Transmittal and
the Company Stock Certificates, if any, so surrendered shall be cancelled.
Until so surrendered, each Company Stock Certificate outstanding after the
Effective Time will be deemed, for all corporate purposes thereafter, to
evidence only the right to receive the cash amounts payable hereunder in
exchange for shares of Company Capital Stock (without interest). Subject to
Section 1.8(e), no portion of the Merger Consideration will be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to shares
of Company Capital Stock formerly represented thereby until the holder of
record of such Company Stock Certificate shall surrender such Company Stock
Certificate and validly executed Exchange Documents pursuant hereto. Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent or
Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time) to, pay, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, the Merger Consideration, if any, payable in
respect thereto pursuant to Section 1.6(b) upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the holder thereof in the form included in the Letter of
Transmittal.

(f)Transfers of Ownership. If any cash amounts are to be disbursed pursuant to
Section 1.6 and this Section 1.8 to a Person other than the Person whose name
is reflected on the Company Stock Certificate or in Book Entry, as applicable,
surrendered in exchange therefor, it will be a condition of the payment
thereof that the Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry, as applicable, so
surrendered will be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting
such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of any portion of
the Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the registered holder
of the Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry, as applicable, surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(g)Paying Agent to Return Merger Consideration. At any time following the last
day of the sixth (6th) month following the Closing Date, the Paying Agent
shall deliver to Parent or its designated successor or assign all cash amounts
that have been deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 1.8(b)(i),
not disbursed to the holders of shares represented by Company Stock
Certificates or Book Entry, as applicable, or Company Warrants pursuant to
Section 1.8(d), and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to
Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation (subject to the terms of Section
1.8(i)) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any and all cash
amounts that may be payable to such holders pursuant to Section 1.8(d) upon
the due surrender of such Company Stock Certificates, if applicable, and duly
executed Exchange Documents, if applicable, in the manner set forth in Section
1.8(d). No interest shall be payable for the cash amounts delivered to Parent
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 1.8(g) and which are subsequently
delivered to the holders of shares represented by Company Stock Certificates
or Book Entry, as applicable, or Company Warrants.

(h)No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. Following the
consummation of the Merger, the cash amounts paid in respect of the surrender
for exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

(i)No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
none of Parent, the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation, or any party
hereto shall be liable to a Stockholder for any amount paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Legal Requirement.

(j)Statement of Specified Liabilities; Payoff Letters; Invoices; Transaction
Bonuses.

(i)Without limitation to any other provision of this Agreement, in making any
payment in respect of any Specified Liabilities at the Closing and in
calculating the Total Consideration, Parent shall be entitled to rely on a
statement (the "Statement of Specified Liabilities") Expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries and
unpaid as of the Closing, (ii) the SVB Indebtedness and (iii) all Change in
Control Payments. The Company shall deliver the Statement of Specified
Liabilities no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.
The Statement of Specified Liabilities shall include wire instructions for
each payment of Third Party Expenses, each Change in Control Payment, and the
SVB Indebtedness (the "Repaid Indebtedness"). At the Closing, Parent shall
pay, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time) to pay, the Third Party Expenses, the
Change in Control Payments, the Repaid Indebtedness, the First Contingent
Purchase Price Payment (as defined in the Charter Documents) and the Second
Contingent Purchase Price Payment (as defined in the Charter Documents).

(ii)No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall obtain from each holder of Repaid Indebtedness, and deliver to
Parent, an executed payoff letter, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Parent, setting forth: (i) the amounts required to pay off in full on the
Closing Date, the Repaid Indebtedness owing to such creditor (including the
outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest and prepayment and other
penalties) and wire transfer information for such payment; (ii) upon payment
of such amounts, a release of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries; and
(iii) the commitment of the creditor to release all Liens, if any, that the
creditor may hold on any of the assets of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date, and attaching an IRS Form W-9 or the
appropriate series of IRS Form W-8, as applicable, or any other necessary Tax
forms or any similar information requested by or on behalf of Parent in
writing (each, a "Payoff Letter").

(iii)Prior to, or at the Closing, the Company shall file (or arranged to be
filed) all agreements, instruments, certificates and other documents, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, that are necessary or
appropriate to effect the release of all Liens set forth in Schedule
1.8(j)(iii). No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall deliver invoices to Parent in respect of all Third Party
Expenses set forth on the Statement of Specified Liabilities. The Company
shall take all necessary action to ensure that Third Party Expenses shall not
be incurred by the Company after the Closing Date without the express prior
written consent of Parent. The Company's Subsidiaries shall not incur any
Third Party Expenses.

(iv)At the Closing, Parent shall pay the Transaction Bonuses to the
individuals and in the respective amounts set forth on Schedule 1.8(j)(iv).

1.9Withholding Taxes. The Company, the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of U.S.
federal, state, local or non-U.S. Legal Requirements and shall be provided any
necessary Tax forms, including IRS Form W-9 or the appropriate series of IRS
Form W-8, as applicable. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. To the extent
that such amounts are not so deducted and withheld, any such amounts imposed
by a Governmental Entity shall be treated as Indemnified Taxes for purposes of
this Agreement.

1.10Company Loans. In the event that any Holder as a borrower has outstanding
loans from the Company as of the Effective Time, the cash portion of any
amounts payable to such holder or pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof, if any,
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the outstanding principal Time, plus any other amounts owed by such Holder to the Company (collectively,
such Holder's "Loan Repayment Amount"). Such loans shall be satisfied as to
the amount by which the cash consideration is reduced pursuant to this Section
1.10. To the extent the consideration payable to such Holder is so reduced,
such amount shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to such Holder.

1.1Taking of Further Action. If at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company, or to vest Parent with full right, title and possession to all
of the Company Capital Stock, then each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent
and the officers and directors of each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent
are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise
to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.

bonuses, commissions or amounts under other compensation plans, that were
previously earned, vested or accrued under Company Employee Plans prior to the

other than those disclosed in Section 2.15(a). Since January 1, 2017, neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary has implemented any plant closing or mass
layoff as defined in, and that has required advance notice pursuant to, the

bound by, any collective bargaining agreement, or other Contracts or
agreements with any union, works council, employee representative or other
labor organization or group of employees with respect to Employees and no such
agreement is being negotiated by the Company or any Subsidiary.

(c)No Interference. To the Knowledge of the Company, no Stockholder, director,
officer, Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated under
any, subject to any Order of any Governmental Entity that would interfere with
such person's efforts to carry out his/her functions to promote the interests
of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries or that would interfere with the
Company's and each of its Subsidiaries' business.

2.18Governmental Authorizations. Each material notification, consent, license,
permit, grant or other authorization (a) pursuant to which the Company or any
Subsidiary currently operates or holds any interest in any of their respective

required to permit the Company and the Subsidiaries to operate or conduct

Subsidiary has commenced any Action (including any Action relating to any
Intellectual Property Rights) or otherwise entered into any settlement,

the assets, business, equipment, properties, and operations of the Company or
any Subsidiary, including with respect to each such policy, the policy number,

sufficient for all Material Contracts to which the Company or any Subsidiary
is a party and, to the Knowledge of the Company, all applicable Legal
Requirements. There is no material claim by the Company or any Subsidiary
pending under any such policies or bonds as to which coverage has been
questioned, denied or disputed, and the Company and each Subsidiary, as
applicable, has given timely notice to applicable insurers of all material
claims that may be insured or covered by any such policies or bonds. In

notice pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall not be considered in determining
whether the condition set forth in Section 1.2(b)(i)(B) or Section
1.2(b)(i)(C) has been satisfied. No disclosure by the Company pursuant to this

such Tax Return that is an income Tax Return and at least ten (10) calendar
days prior to filing of any such Tax Return that is a material non-income Tax
Return, and shall consider in good faith the Representative's reasonable
comments.

in full force and effect following the Merger. Such consents, modifications,
waivers and approvals shall be in a form acceptable to Parent. The Company

payments" (which determination shall be made by the Company and shall be
subject to review and approval by Parent) (within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) (the "Section 280G
Payments"), such that such 280G Payments shall not be deemed to be "parachute
payments" under Section 280G of the Code. Prior to the Closing, the Company vote was solicited in conformance with Section 280G and the regulations
promulgated thereunder and that (i) the requisite Stockholder approval was
obtained with respect to any payments and/or benefits that were subject to the

(c)Compensation and Benefits. For the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on December 31, 2020, Parent or an affiliate of Parent shall
provide employees of the Company who continue to be employed by the Company or

benefits as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Nothing contained

provide Parent with evidence that any such 401(k) Plan has been terminated
(effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date)
pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board (or similar body) of the Company
or its ERISA Affiliates, as the case may be. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be provided to Parent for review and approval no later than
three (3) Business Days before the Closing Date. The furtherance of terminating any such Company Employee Plan as Parent may
require. In the event that termination of a 401(k) Plan would reasonably be

shall be the responsibility of the Company, and the Company shall take such
actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges
and/or fees and provide such estimate in the Statement of Specified
Liabilities. The Company also shall have taken and shall take such other
actions in furtherance of terminating any other Company Employee Plans as
Parent may require.

is intended, or shall be interpreted, to provide nor create any third party

effect and (ii) shall not, and shall not permit the Surviving Corporation to,
(A) amend, repeal or modify any provision of the RandW Insurance Policy without
Representative's prior written express consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, it being understood that it shall not be
unreasonable for Representative to withhold consent in the event that any such
amendment, repeal or modification would adversely affect the Indemnifying
Parties), (B) take any action or omit to take any action that would result in
the cancellation, termination, amendment or modification of the RandW Insurance
Policy or coverage thereunder other than by payment of claims thereunder and
(C) permit the assignment, substitution or transfer of the rights or
obligations of the insurer under the RandW Insurance Policy other than as
allowed by the terms of the RandW Insurance Policy.

5.13Preservation of Records. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, preserve and keep the records held by them relating to the
business of the Surviving Corporation for a period of one (1) year from the
Closing Date and shall make such records (or copies) and reasonably
appropriate personnel available, at reasonable times and upon reasonable
advance notice, to the Representative as may be reasonably required by the
Representative in connection with any insurance claims by, Actions against or
affecting, or compliance with Legal Requirements by, the Representative,
Stockholders or any of their respective Affiliates. At and after the
expiration of such period, if the Representative has previously requested in
writing that such books and records be preserved, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, either preserve such books and records for
such reasonable period as may be requested by the Representative or transfer
such books and records to Representative at the Indemnifying Parties' sole [RESERVED]

ARTICLE VII



POST-CLOSING INDEMNIFICATION

7.1Survival of Representations, Warranties and Related Indemnification Claims.
The representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement,
and the right to make indemnification claims in respect thereof under this
Agreement, shall survive until 11:59 p.m. California time on the eighteenth
(18th) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the date of expiration of such
period, the "Expiration Date"); provided, however, that (x) in the event of
Fraud or willful breach with respect to a representation or warranty, such
representation or warranty shall survive indefinitely, and (y) each
Fundamental Representation, IP Representation and each Tax Representation, and
the right to make indemnification claims in respect of such Fundamental
Representation, IP Representation or Tax Representation, shall survive until
the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, further, that with
respect to those representations and warranties of the Company which are the
subject of a claim for indemnification that has been delivered in accordance
with Section 7.4 prior to their applicable expiration date as provided herein,
such representations and warranties and the right to make indemnification
claims in respect thereof under this Agreement, shall survive as to such claim
until such claim has been finally resolved; provided further, that where any
survival period that extends beyond the Expiration Date would otherwise be
limited by 10 Del. C. § 8106(a) the parties intend that 10 Del. C. § 8106(c)
shall apply (but shall not exceed the survival period contemplated hereby).
The Indemnifying Parties' obligations in Sections 7.2(a)(ii) - (vii) and the
covenants and agreements of the Company shall survive until the expiration of
the relevant statute of limitations. The representations and warranties of
Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, the Related Agreements or
in any certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement
shall terminate at the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, it is the
intention of the parties hereto that the foregoing respective survival periods
and termination dates supersede any applicable statutes of limitations that
would otherwise apply to such representations and warranties and the right to
make indemnification claims in respect thereof under this Agreement.

7.2Indemnification.

(a)From and after the consummation of the Merger, subject to the terms and
limitations of this Article VII, the Holders (each, an "Indemnifying Party"
and collectively, the "Indemnifying Parties") shall severally, but not
jointly, indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) and their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents, consultants, advisors and Advisers (each, an
"Indemnified Party" and collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"), from and
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages (whether direct, indirect,
incidental or, subject to the terms of Section 7.3(d) below, consequential),
diminution in value (for clarity, excluding diminution calculations premised
solely on multiples of revenues, profits or other financial metrics and non-
cash goodwill impairment charges), royalties, deficiencies, Taxes, costs,
interest, awards, judgments, settlements, penalties and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' and consultants' fees and expenses and including any
such reasonable expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending
(including expenses of offensive actions taken in connection with any
defensive strategy) against or settling any of the foregoing (hereinafter
individually a "Loss" and collectively "Losses") paid, incurred, suffered or
sustained by the Indemnified Parties, or any of them (including the Surviving
Corporation and third party claims), directly or indirectly, resulting from, arising out of,
or relating to any of the following:

(i)any breach of or inaccuracy in a representation or warranty of the Company
set forth in this Agreement or in any certificates or instruments delivered by
or on behalf of the Company in connection herewith, without giving effect to
any update of or modification to the Disclosure Schedule made or purported to
have been made on or after the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that
in the event of any such breach or inaccuracy, solely for purposes of
determining the amount of any Loss relating thereto, no effect will be given
to any qualifications based on the word "material" or similar phrases
(including "Company Material Adverse Effect") contained in such representation
or warranty (or any disclosure schedule related thereto) (i.e., as if such
words or phrases were deleted from such representation and warranty);

(ii)any inaccuracy in any information required to be set forth in the Payment
Spreadsheet or Statement of Specified Liabilities, including any failure to
properly calculate any item required to be contained therein;

(iii)any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any covenant or
agreement of the Company set forth in this Agreement which is required to be
performed prior to the Closing;

(iv)any payment (x) in respect of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the
consideration that otherwise would have been payable in respect of such shares
in accordance with this Agreement and (y) any other Losses paid, incurred,
suffered or sustained in respect of the foregoing, including all reasonable
attorneys' and consultants' fees, costs and expenses and including any such
fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending
against or settling any Action in respect of the foregoing;

(v)any Indemnified Taxes;

(vi)third party Actions against Parent or any Subsidiary (including the
Company) following the Closing, including the costs of defending against and
settling any such third party claims, if the facts and circumstances alleged
in any such third party Action would give the Indemnified Parties a right to
indemnification under Section 7.2(a)(i) if such facts and circumstances were
factually accurate; or

(vii)any Fraud or willful breach by or on behalf of the Company or any
Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Disclosure Schedule) or the Transactions.

(b)Each Indemnifying Party waives, and acknowledges and agrees that such
Indemnifying Party shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt
to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity, right
to advancement of expenses or other right or remedy against the Surviving
Corporation or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with any
indemnification obligation or any other liability to which such Indemnifying
Party may become subject under or in connection with this Agreement or any
other Related Agreement. Effective as of the Closing, the Representative, on
behalf of itself and each Indemnifying Party, expressly waives and releases
any right of subrogation, contribution, advancement or indemnification and any
other claim that the Representative or such Indemnifying Party may have,
against Parent, any Affiliate of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
the Subsidiary of the Company. obligations under this Article VII will, to the extent permissible under
applicable Legal Requirement, be treated as adjustments to the Total
Consideration for Tax purposes and such agreed treatment will govern for
purposes of this Agreement.

(d)Except in connection with claims based on Fraud or willful breach, the
indemnification rights set forth in this Article VII shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties from and after the Effective Time
for any claims arising under this Agreement, including claims of any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in this
Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered in connection
herewith; provided, however, that this Section 7.2(d) shall not be deemed a
waiver by any party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief
or other non-monetary equitable remedies.

(e)Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or any other
Indemnified Party to pursue remedies under any Related Agreement against the
parties thereto, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the limitations on indemnification set
forth in this Article VII).

(f)The rights of the Indemnified Parties to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement, payment of Losses or any other remedy under this Agreement
shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date,
with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company or any
other matter. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any such
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
such covenant or agreement, will not affect the right to indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement, payment of Losses, or any other remedy based on
any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. No Indemnified Party
shall be required to show reliance on any representation, warranty,
certificate or other agreement in order for such Indemnified Party to be
entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement hereunder.

(g)If an Indemnified Party's claim under Section 7.2(a) may be brought under
different sections of Section 7.2(a), then such Indemnified Party shall have
the right to bring such claim under any applicable section it chooses in
accordance with Section 7.2(a), provided, however, that in no event shall any
Indemnified Party be entitled to double recovery with respect to any
particular incident, fact or event which resulted in Losses subject to
indemnification under Section 7.2(a) regardless of whether there were breaches
of more than one representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or otherwise

7.3Limitations on Indemnification.

(a)Basket. Except for claims based on Fraud or willful breach, the Indemnified
Parties, as a group, may not recover any Losses pursuant to an indemnification
claim under Section 7.2(a)(i) unless and until the Indemnified Parties, as a
group, shall have paid, incurred, suffered or sustained $50,000 in Losses in
the aggregate in respect of indemnification claims under Section 7.2(a), in
which case the Indemnified Parties may recover all such Losses in excess of
$50,000.

(b)Recourse to Holdback and Policy. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, subject to Section 7.3(a), if an Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification for Losses claimed pursuant to the indemnity set
forth in Section 7.2(a) (other than claims for Fraud or willful breach), fifty
percent (50%) of such amount shall be paid and satisfied from the Holdback and fifty percent (50%) of such amount shall be borne, paid and/or satisfied,
as applicable, by the Indemnified Parties (which for the avoidance of doubt
means until the aggregate amount of all Losses the Indemnifying Party is
required to pay or is liable for exceeds the Holdback Amount, in which event
the applicable Indemnified Party may seek recovery for any portion of a Loss
for which an indemnification claim has been made but not paid due to the
limitation on liability set forth in this Section 7.3(b) solely and directly
from the RandW Insurance Policy).

(c)Maximum Liability.

(i)Except as specifically set forth in this Article VII, (x) the maximum
amount that an Indemnified Party may recover for Losses pursuant to the
indemnity set forth in Section 7.2(a) (other than claims for Fraud or willful
breach) shall be limited to an amount equal to the Holdback Amount and the
policy limit under the RandW Insurance Policy and (y) the sole and exclusive
sources of recovery for an Indemnified Party to recover Losses pursuant to the
indemnity set forth in Section 7.2(a) (other than claims for Fraud or willful
breach) shall be the Holdback Amount and the RandW Insurance Policy.

(ii)Subject to Section 7.3(b), the Indemnified Parties' first source of
recovery for claims under Section 7.2(a) shall be recourse against the
Holdback Amount, but if the Holdback Amount (or the remaining portion thereof)
is insufficient to satisfy any portion of a Loss for which an indemnification
claim has been made, the Indemnified Parties shall next be entitled to recover
such portion of such Losses in respect of such claims directly from the RandW
Insurance Policy until it has been exhausted; provided, that no Indemnified
Party shall be required to seek recovery from the RandW Insurance Policy for a
matter that is expressly excluded from coverage under the RandW Insurance
Policy; provided, further that, such exclusions from the RandW Insurance Policy
shall in no way affect the indemnification limits set forth in this Agreement.
Parent acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Section 7.3(c)
shall apply regardless of whether (i) Parent obtains or maintains the RandW
Insurance Policy, (ii) the RandW Insurance Policy is revoked, cancelled or
modified in any manner after issuance or (iii) an Indemnified Party makes a
claim under the RandW Insurance Policy and such claim is denied in whole or in
part; provided, however, that, subject to Section 7.3(c)(iii), nothing in this
Article VII shall limit the liability of an Indemnifying Party in connection
with a claim based on Fraud or willful breach.

(iii)The liability of each Indemnifying Party for indemnification claims based
on Fraud or willful breach under this Agreement shall be limited, in the
aggregate, to a dollar amount equal to the portion of the Total Consideration
actually received by such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement,
including any amounts withheld by Parent in accordance with this Agreement in
respect of Taxes, the Holdback Amount, the Representative Expense Amount or
otherwise; provided, however, that nothing in this Article VII shall limit the
liability of an Indemnifying Party in connection with a claim based on such
Indemnifying Party's own Fraud or willful breach. No Indemnifying Party shall
be liable for any Fraud or willful breach committed by any other Holder,
except the Fraud or willful breach of such other Holder that also constitutes
Fraud or willful breach by the Company or any Subsidiary, and for each other
claim, an Indemnifying Party shall only be liable for its Aggregate Pro Rata
Portion of any Losses related to such claim.

(iv)For the avoidance of doubt, (A) nothing herein is intended to, nor shall
it have the effect of, limiting or diminishing the right of an Indemnified
Party to seek or obtain recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy, and (B) as
between Parent, on the one hand, and the insurer(s) under the RandW Insurance
Policy, on the other hand, none of the limitations and restrictions (including the rights of the Indemnified Party under the RandW Insurance Policy, which
rights shall be governed solely thereby.

(d)The amount of any Losses that are subject to indemnification under this
Article VII shall be calculated net of the amount of any insurance proceeds
(excluding the RandW Insurance Policy) actually received by the Indemnified
Parties in respect of such Losses or any of the events or circumstances giving
rise or otherwise related to such Losses (net of any costs or expenses
incurred in obtaining such insurance, including any increases in insurance
premiums resulting from any insurance recovery) and the Indemnified Parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek full recovery under any
applicable insurance policies that might be applicable to such Losses. In the
event that any insurance (excluding the RandW Insurance Policy) is actually
received by any Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses for which such
Indemnified Party has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the
net aggregate amount of the recovery (after taking into account of any costs
or expenses incurred in obtaining such insurance (other than the RandW Insurance
Policy), including any increases in insurance premiums resulting from any
insurance recovery) shall be made promptly to the Indemnifying Parties (in an
amount equal to the Aggregate Pro Rata Portion of the Loss paid by or on
behalf of each Indemnifying Party in respect of which such recovery is made).

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no
Indemnifying Party shall, in any event, be liable to any other Indemnified
Party for any exemplary or punitive damages except to the extent such
exemplary or punitive damages are paid to a third party.

(f)No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover Losses relating to any
matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the extent that such
Indemnified Party has recovered Losses in respect of the same such matter
under another provision of this Agreement. Upon discovery of any matter for
which an Indemnified Party is, or may be, entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate its Losses in connection with such matter.

(g)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to recover Losses (i) relating to the existence,
amount, expiration date or limitation on (or the availability of) any net
operating loss carryforward, Tax credit carryforward, Tax basis or other
similar Tax attribute of the Company in any taxable period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date or (ii) resulting from any election
under Section 338 or Section 336(e) of the Code or any state, local or foreign
law equivalent in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

7.4Indemnification Claim Procedures.

(a)Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.1, if an Indemnified
Party wishes to make an indemnification claim under this Article VII, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver a written notice (an "Indemnification
Claim Notice") to the Representative (or in the event an Indemnified Party
elects to pursue such indemnification claim directly against an Indemnifying
Party, to such Indemnifying Party directly) (i) stating that an Indemnified
Party has paid, incurred, suffered or sustained, or reasonably anticipates
that it may pay, incur, suffer or sustain Losses, and (ii) to the extent
known, specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such Losses or the basis
for such anticipated liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation,
breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is related. Parent may
update an Indemnification Claim Notice from time to time to reflect any new
information discovered with respect to the claim set forth in such
Indemnification Claim Notice. The Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnifying Party and its Advisers to investigate the matter or circumstance
alleged to give rise to the respect of the indemnification claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist
the Indemnifying Party's investigation by giving such information and
assistance (including access to the Company's premises and personnel and the
right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or records during normal
business hours) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its Advisers may
reasonably request.

(b)If the Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties or the
Indemnifying Party, as applicable, shall not object in writing within the
thirty (30) day period after receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice by
delivery of a written notice of objection containing a reasonably detailed
description of the facts and circumstances supporting an objection to the
applicable indemnification claim (an "Indemnification Claim Objection
Notice"), such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by
the Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties or the applicable
Indemnifying Party that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount
of the claim for Losses set forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice. In
such event, Parent shall be entitled to retain from the Holdback Amount the
amount of Losses set forth in the Indemnification Claim Notice. Should the
Holdback Amount (or the remaining portion thereof), if any, be insufficient to
satisfy in whole the amount to be paid to an Indemnified Party by the
Indemnifying Parties in accordance with such Indemnification Claim Notice
(subject to the limitations on indemnification set forth in this Article VII),
then each Indemnifying Party shall, within ten (10) Business Days following
the expiration date of the right of the Representative to make an
Indemnification Claim Objection Notice, pay to the Indemnified Party, such
Indemnifying Parties' Aggregate Pro Rata Portion of such shortfall.

(c)In the event that the Representative or the Indemnifying Party, as
applicable, shall deliver an Indemnification Claim Objection Notice in
accordance with Section 7.4(b) within thirty (30) calendar days after delivery
of such Indemnification Claim Notice, the Representative (on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties) or the Indemnifying Party, as applicable, and Parent may
attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with
respect to each of such claims. If the Representative or Indemnifying Party,
as applicable, and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of an
indemnification claim to be recovered from the Holdback Amount, Parent shall
be entitled to conclusively rely on any such memorandum and shall retain
amounts from the Holdback Amount (or the remaining portion thereof) in
accordance with the terms hereof.

(d)If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and prior
to thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of an Indemnification Claim
Objection Notice, either Parent or the Representative or Indemnifying Party,
as applicable, may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the
Loss that is at issue is the subject of a pending litigation with a third
party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is
ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration, and in either such event the
matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by one arbitrator mutually
agreeable to Parent and the Representative or Indemnifying Party, as
applicable. In the event that, within thirty (30) calendar days after
submission of any dispute to arbitration, Parent and the Representative or
Indemnifying Party, as applicable, cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator,
then, within fifteen (15) calendar days after the end of such thirty (30)
calendar day period, Parent and the Representative or Indemnifying Party, as
applicable, shall each select one independent arbitrator. The two arbitrators
so selected shall select a third independent arbitrator.

(e)Any such arbitration shall be held in New York City, New York, under the
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS ("JAMS"). The
arbitrator(s) shall determine how all expenses relating to the arbitration
shall be paid, including the respective expenses of each party, or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a limited time period and
establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while
allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the
arbitrator or majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, to
discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject
matter of the dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the three arbitrators,
as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and
shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys' fees and
costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or equity, should the
arbitrators or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be,
determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that
discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification. The
decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case
may be, as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Indemnification
Claim Notice shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties to this
Agreement and the Indemnifying Parties. Such decision shall be written and
shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set
forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s), and
in the case of an indemnification claim to be recovered from the Holdback
Amount, Parent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on, and retain such
amounts from the Holdback Amount in accordance with, the terms of such award,
judgment, decree or order as applicable. Within thirty (30) calendar days of a
decision of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by Parent to the Indemnifying
Parties or by the Indemnifying Parties to Parent, such Person(s) shall make
the payment to such other Person(s), including any retention from the Holdback
Amount, as applicable. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s)
may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The forgoing arbitration
provision shall apply to any dispute among the Indemnifying Parties or any
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties under this Article VII, whether
or not relating to claims to recover funds from the Holdback Amount.

(f)On the fifth (5th) Business Day following the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, Parent shall (i) retain an amount, if any, equal to the amount
of any claims for indemnification asserted in good faith by an Indemnified
Party in an Indemnification Claim Notice delivered in accordance with Section
7.4 prior to the termination of the Expiration Date but which are not yet
resolved or for which payment has not yet been made (each such claim, an
"Unresolved Claim") and (ii) subject to reimbursement claims of the
Representative as contemplated in Section 7.6(b), release any remaining
Holdback Amount net of such Unresolved Claims to the Paying Agent and the
Surviving Corporation for further distribution to the Holders in accordance
with this Agreement. The Holdback Amount retained for each Unresolved Claim
shall be released (to the extent such funds are not utilized to indemnify any
Indemnified Party for such Unresolved Claim in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement) by Parent to the Paying Agent and Surviving Corporation,
respectively, for further distribution to the Holders in accordance with their
respective Aggregate Pro Rata Portion as set forth in this Agreement upon the
resolution of such Unresolved Claim in accordance with this Article VII.

7.6Third Party Claims. In the event an Indemnified Party becomes aware of a
third party claim which, if the allegations contained therein were true, would
result in a claim under Section 7.2(a) (a "Third-Party Claim"), the
Indemnified Party shall notify the Representative thereof; provided, however,
that any failure on the part of the Indemnified Party to so notify the
Representative shall not limit any of the obligations of the Indemnifying
Parties under this Article VII. Such Indemnified Party shall have the right in
its sole discretion to conduct the defense of and to settle or resolve any
such claim (and the costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with such defense, settlement or resolution (including reasonable
attorneys' fees, other professionals' and experts' fees and court or
arbitration costs) shall be included in the amount for which the Indemnified
Party may seek indemnification pursuant to a claim made hereunder); provided,
however, that except with the consent of the Representative (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), no such settlement or
resolution shall circumstances relating to such claim; provided, further, however, that the
consent of the Representative with respect to any such settlement or
resolution shall be deemed to have been given unless the Representative shall
have objected within thirty (30) calendar days after a written request for
such consent. In the event that the Representative consents to any such
settlement or resolution, the Indemnifying Parties shall have no power or
authority to object under any provision of this Article VII to the amount of
such settlement or resolution. To the extent it does not affect any privilege
relating to any Indemnified Party, the Representative shall be entitled, at
the Indemnifying Parties' expense, to participate in, but not to determine or
conduct, any defense of such Third-Party Claim or settlement negotiations with
respect thereto and the Indemnified Party shall consider in good faith
recommendations made by the Representative with respect thereto. For the
avoidance of doubt and subject to the other terms of this Agreement, the
Representative and the Indemnifying Parties shall keep any information
obtained in connection with such Third-Party Claim confidential in accordance
with Section 8.6 hereof as though such information was subject to the terms of
the Confidential Disclosure Agreement, and in no event shall the
Representative or any Indemnifying Party disclose such information to any
third party unless and until such party has executed a confidentiality
agreement with respect to such information, or is otherwise subject to
applicable confidentiality obligations, containing confidentiality terms no
less favorable to the parties than those contained in the Confidential
Disclosure Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the
Confidential Disclosure Agreement to the contrary, the Representative will not
be required to return or destroy any information prior to such time as its
responsibilities in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are complete. The Indemnified Parties will have the right in their
sole discretion to settle or otherwise consent to the resolution of any Third-
Party Claim.

7.6Representative.

(a)By virtue of the execution and delivery of a Joinder Agreement and/or a
Stockholder Written Consent, and the adoption of this Agreement and approval
of the Merger by the Stockholders, each of the Indemnifying Parties shall be
deemed to have agreed to appoint, and hereby designates, Shareholder
Representative Services LLC as its agent and attorney-in-fact, as the
Representative for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties for all purposes
in connection with this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto,
including to give and receive notices and communications in respect of
indemnification claims under this Agreement, to authorize payment to any
Indemnified Party from the Holdback Amount in satisfaction of any
indemnification claims hereunder by any Indemnified Party, to object to such
payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of,
and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to any such indemnification claims, to assert,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration
and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to,
any such indemnification claim by any Indemnified Party hereunder against any
Indemnifying Party or by any such Indemnifying Party against any Indemnified
Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party and any such Indemnifying
Party, in each case relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, and to
take all other actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the
judgment of the Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii)
mandated or permitted by the terms of this Agreement or the agreements
ancillary hereto. Such agency may be changed by the Indemnifying Parties from
time to time upon not less than thirty (30) calendar days prior written notice
to Parent; provided, however, that the Representative may not be removed
unless holders of a two-thirds interest of the Holdback Amount agree to such
removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. The Representative may
resign at any time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a
resignation of the Representative or other vacancy in the position of
Representative, such vacancy may be filled by the holders of a majority in
interest of the Closing, notices or communications to or from the Representative shall
constitute notice to or from the Indemnifying Parties.

(b)The Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted in
connection with the Representative's services pursuant to this Agreement and
any agreements ancillary hereto except in the event of liability directly
resulting from the Representative's bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Representative shall not be liable for any action or omission
pursuant to the advice of counsel. The Indemnifying Parties shall severally,
and not jointly, solely for its, his or her Aggregate Pro Rata Portion,
indemnify and defend the Representative and hold the Representative harmless
from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties,
fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Representative's
duties hereunder or under any agreements ancillary hereto, including the
reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the
Representative ("Representative Expenses"), in each case, as such
Representative Expense is incurred or suffered; provided, that in the event
that any such Representative Expense is finally adjudicated to have been
directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Representative, the Representative will reimburse the Indemnifying Parties the
amount of such indemnified Representative Expense to the extent attributable
to such gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided, further, that the
liability of each Indemnifying Party for indemnification claims by the
Representative under this Agreement shall be limited, in the aggregate, to a
dollar amount equal to the portion of the Total Consideration actually
received by such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement (without regard
to any withholding applicable to such payments). If not paid directly to the
Representative by the Indemnifying Parties, any such Representative Expenses
may be recovered by the Representative from (i) the Representative Expense
Amount and (ii) the amounts of the Holdback Amount at such time as remaining
amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Indemnifying Parties in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Representative Expense Amount
shall be available to pay directly, or reimburse the Representative for, any
Representative Expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, while this Section 7.6(b)
allows the Representative to be paid from the Representative Expense Fund and
the Holdback Amount, this Section 7.6(b) shall not limit the obligation of any
Indemnifying Party to promptly pay such Representative Expenses as they are
incurred, nor does it prevent the Representative from seeking any remedies
available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Representative be
required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties or
otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of, or
provisions limiting the recourse against non-parties otherwise applicable to,
the Indemnifying Parties set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not
intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Representative
under this Section 7.6. The Indemnifying Parties acknowledge and agree that
the foregoing indemnities in this Section 7.6(b) will survive the resignation
or removal of the Representative or the termination of this Agreement.
Following the completion of the Representative's duties, the Representative
shall distribute such portion of the Representative Expense Amount that has
not been used to reimburse the Representative for Representative Expenses, if
any, to the Paying Agent and the Surviving Corporation (in respect of amounts
held in the Representative Expense Fund on behalf of holders of Vested Company
Options), who will each promptly distribute such funds to the Indemnifying
Parties in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions. A decision,
act, consent or instruction of the Representative, including an amendment,
extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2 or Section 8.3,
shall constitute a decision of the Indemnifying Parties and shall be final,
conclusive and binding upon the Indemnifying Parties; and Parent and their
respective Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) may rely upon any
such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Representative as being the
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Indemnifying Parties. Parent and
its respective Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) are any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Representative.

by Goodwin Procter, LLP (the "Firm") prior to the date hereof, including,
without limitation, in connection with the preparation, negotiation and

"Transaction Agreements"), each of Parent and the Company agrees, on their own
behalf and on behalf of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time,
that after the Closing the Firm may represent the Representative, the
Indemnifying Parties and/or their Affiliates in all matters related to the
Transaction Agreements, including without limitation in respect of any

Parties may be directly adverse to Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the

Annex, or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Annex or Exhibit to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to an Article or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or
a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The words "include,"
"includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be
followed by the words "without limitation." All references in this Agreement
to "$" or dollars shall mean U.S. denominated dollars (and to the extent any

calculated on an as-converted basis to U.S. denominated dollars using the spot
exchange rate as of the close of business on the Business Day prior to
Closing). The phrases "ordinary course," "ordinary course of business,"

parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel during the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the
application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing
that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against
the party drafting such agreement or document. No prior draft of this
Agreement, any Related Agreement nor any course of performance or course of
dealing shall be used in the interpretation or construction of this Agreement.

Time); provided, that no amendment after the receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval and which requires Stockholder approval under applicable
Legal Requirements shall be effective until the receipt of the Requisite

representations and warranties made to such party set forth herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the

herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party that is granting such extension and/or waiver. For
purposes of this Section 8.3, the Holders are deemed to have agreed that any
extension or waiver signed by the Company shall be binding upon and effective
against all Stockholders whether or not they have signed such extension or
waiver. No extension or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any
breach or default thereof shall extend to or affect in any way any other
provision or other prior or subsequent breach or default.

Agreement, whether by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written

economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.
