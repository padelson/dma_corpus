ARTICLE I

THE OFFER AND THE MERGERS

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Parent shall cause Purchaser to, and Purchaser shall, commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than the
fifteenth (15th) Business Day after the date of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be required to commence
the Offer if the Company shall not be prepared to file with the SEC
immediately following commencement of the Offer, and to disseminate to holders
of shares of Company Common Stock, the Schedule 14D-9. The date on which
Purchaser commences the Offer, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act, is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Commencement
Date_." The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "
_Offer to Purchase_ ") that is disseminated to any and all of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock and contains the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement and in Annex A. In the Offer, each share of Company
Common Stock accepted by Purchaser in accordance with the terms of the Offer
shall, subject to the adjustments set forth in Section 2.1(d) and Section
2.1(g), be exchanged for the right to receive the Transaction Consideration.
Subject to the prior satisfaction of the Minimum Tender Condition and the
satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Purchaser, of the other Offer Conditions
(to the extent such waiver is permitted by Section 1.1(c)), after the
expiration of the Offer (as it may extended in accordance with Section
1.1(d)), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) accept for
payment all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not
withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer (excluding shares of Company Common Stock
tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been
delivered for settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee) as soon as
practicable after Purchaser is permitted to do so under applicable Law (the "
_Acceptance Time_ "), and promptly (within the meaning of Section 14e-1(c)
promulgated under the Exchange Act) pay for all shares of Company Common Stock
that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Offer.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall provide or
cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely basis the funds and shares of
Parent QVC Series A Stock necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common
Stock that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer;
_provided_ , _however_ , that without the prior written consent of the
Company, Purchaser shall not accept for payment or pay for any shares of
Company Common Stock if, as a result, Purchaser would acquire less than the
number of shares of Company Common Stock necessary to satisfy the Minimum
Tender Condition. The consideration in the Offer payable in respect of each
share of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer
shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash and shares of Parent QVC
Series A Stock, subject to reduction for any applicable withholding taxes
payable in respect thereof. The Company shall register (and shall instruct its
transfer agent to register) the transfer of the shares of Company Common
Stock accepted for payment by Purchaser effective immediately after the
Acceptance Time.

 



3 (b) The obligation of Purchaser to accept for exchange (and the obligation of
Parent to cause Purchaser to accept for exchange) shares of Company Common
Stock validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer shall be
subject only to:

 

(i) the condition (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ ") that there shall have
been validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) prior to the expiration of
the Offer that number of shares of Company Common Stock which, upon the
consummation of the Offer (for the avoidance of doubt, assuming that the
shares of Class B Common Stock validly tendered (and not validly
withdrawn) will convert to shares of Class A Common Stock at the time of the
consummation of the Offer), when added to any shares of Company Common Stock
owned by Purchaser, would represent at least a majority of the voting power of
the sum of (x) the aggregate voting power of the shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately after the consummation of the Offer, plus (y)
the aggregate voting power of the shares of Company Common Stock issuable to
holders of Company Options from which the Company has received notices of
exercise prior to the consummation of the Offer (and as to which shares of
Company Common Stock have not yet been issued to such exercising holders of
Company Options) (excluding, for purposes of determining whether a sufficient
number of shares have been tendered in the Offer to satisfy the Minimum Tender
Condition, shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed
delivery procedures that have not yet been "received," as such term is
defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL, by the depositary for the Offer
pursuant to such procedures); and

 

(ii) the other conditions set forth in Annex A (such other conditions,
together with the Minimum Tender Condition, the " _Offer Conditions_ ").

(c) Purchaser expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to waive
or make any other changes to the terms and conditions of the Offer;
_provided_ _,_ _however_ , that without the prior written consent of the
Company, neither Parent nor Purchaser shall: (i) amend, waive or modify any of
the conditions set forth in clauses (a), (h)(i), (h)(ii), (i) or (j) of Annex
A ( _provided_ , that Parent shall (and shall cause Purchaser to) waive the
conditions set forth in clause (h)(i) and (h)(ii) of Annex A upon the written
request of the Company); or (ii) change the Offer to (A) change the form or
amount of consideration to be delivered by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or Purchaser may increase the amount of
such consideration (irrespective of form) in good faith so long as such
increase is not for the purpose of delaying the Acceptance Time, provided that
in no event shall such increase reduce the Initial Exchange Ratio, (B) change
the number of shares of Company Common Stock to be purchased in the Offer,
(C) impose conditions to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions or
amend or modify any of the existing Offer Conditions, (D) except as provided
in Section 1.1(d), extend the expiration time of the Offer beyond the initial
expiration time of the Offer or (E) otherwise amend the Offer in a manner that
is adverse (other than in an immaterial or de minimis way) to the holders of
Company Common Stock.

 

(d) The Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire at 12:00 midnight, New
York City time, on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days following the
Offer Commencement Date (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule
14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) (such initial expiration time and date, or
such subsequent time and date to which the expiration of the Offer is
extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, the

 



4  " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, but subject to the Parties respective termination rights
under Section 7.1, (i) if, at the time as of which the Offer is scheduled to
expire, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, then
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) extend the Offer on one
or, if necessary, more occasions, for additional successive periods of up to
ten (10) Business Days per extension (with the length of such periods to be
determined by Parent), until all Offer Conditions are satisfied or validly
waived in order to permit the Acceptance Time to occur; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Purchaser or Parent be required or
permitted to extend the Offer to a date later than the Outside Date, other
than (A) any such extension requested by Parent or Purchaser and consented to
by the Company, (B) any such extension requested by the Company, to the extent
Parent or Purchaser would be prohibited from terminating this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii) or (C) any such extension requested by Parent
or Purchaser, to the extent the Company would be prohibited from terminating
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii); and (ii) Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to) extend the Offer from time to time for
any period required by any applicable Laws or any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff of the SEC or the Nasdaq
applicable to the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
Purchaser or Parent be required, or permitted, to extend the Offer to a date
later than the Outside Date, other than (A) any such extension requested by
Parent or Purchaser and consented to by the Company, (B) any such extension
requested by the Company, to the extent Parent or Purchaser would be
prohibited from terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii) or
(C) any such extension requested by Parent or Purchaser, to the extent the
Company would be prohibited from terminating this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(b)(iii). For the avoidance of doubt, if, at the Expiration Date of
the Offer, all of the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived in
writing by Parent or Purchaser and this Agreement has not otherwise been
terminated in accordance with its terms, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to) promptly accept for exchange, and deliver the Transaction
Consideration for, all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer in accordance with this Agreement.

income tax purposes, (a) the Offer and the Mergers, taken together, shall
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
and (b) this Agreement, including any amendments thereto, be, and is hereby
adopted as, the "plan of reorganization" involving the Offer and the Mergers
for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

 



10 ARTICLE II

 

TREATMENT OF SECURITIES

 

Section 2.1 _Treatment of Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Purchaser Shares_. At the First Effective Time, each issued
and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Shares_ ") shall be automatically converted into
and become one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock
of the First Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the First Surviving Corporation. From and after the
First Effective Time, all certificates representing Purchaser Shares shall be
deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of Class A Common
Stock of the First Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

(b)  _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. Any outstanding or issued shares
of Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent, the Merger Subs or the
Company, immediately prior to the First Effective Time (collectively, the "
_Excluded Shares_ "), shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and no cash, stock or other consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Treatment of Company Common Stock_. At the First Effective Time, by
virtue of the First Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties
or holders of any securities of the Company or of Purchaser, each share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First
Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall
automatically be converted into (i) the right to receive cash in an amount,
without interest, equal to the Cash Consideration, subject to adjustment in
accordance with and pursuant to Section 2.1(d), and (ii) the right to receive
0.3098 (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.1(g), the " _Initial
Exchange Ratio_ " and as it may be further adjusted in accordance with and
pursuant to Section 2.1(d), the " _Adjusted Exchange Ratio_ ") validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent QVC Series A Stock (the
" _Stock Consideration_ ") (it being understood that if Purchaser or Parent
changes the Offer pursuant to, and in compliance with, Section 1.1(c), then
the Stock Consideration and Cash Consideration that holders of shares of
Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section
2.1(c) by virtue of the First Merger as a result of such change shall be
adjusted accordingly). As of the First Effective Time and upon the conversion
thereof in accordance with this Section 2.1(c), all such shares of Company
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") or
shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_
") shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company
Common Stock, except, in all cases, the right to receive the Transaction
Consideration without any interest. The right of any holder of any share of
Company Common Stock to receive the Cash Consideration shall be subject
to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under
applicable Tax Law.

 



11 (d) _Appraisal Adjustment_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, to preserve the qualification of the Offer and the Mergers, taken
together, as a "reorganization" under the Code, if, as of the Acceptance Time,
the Total Stock Consideration (as defined below), determined without regard to
any shares of Parent QVC Series A Stock issued pursuant to clause (x), would
be less than 43% of the Aggregate Consideration (as defined below), determined
without regard to any shares of Parent QVC Series A Stock issued pursuant to
clause (x), then (x) the Initial Exchange Ratio shall be increased by that
number of shares (or fraction of a share) of Parent QVC Series A Stock such
that, after such adjustment and the adjustment contemplated by clause (y), the
Total Stock Consideration will be equal to 43% of the Aggregate
Consideration, and (y) the Cash Consideration shall be correspondingly
decreased by an amount equal to the increased number of shares (or fraction of
a share) of Parent QVC Series A Stock determined in clause (x) multiplied by
the Parent Share Signing Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Aggregate
Consideration prior to the adjustments set forth in this sentence shall be
equal to the Aggregate Consideration following the adjustments set forth in
this sentence. For purposes of this Section 2.1(d), (i) " _Total Stock
Consideration_ " means the product of the Parent Share Signing Price
multiplied by the aggregate number of shares of Parent QVC Series A Stock
to be issued pursuant to the Offer and the First Merger in respect of shares
of Company Common Stock (including for this purpose any fractional shares of
Parent QVC Series A Stock without regard to Section 2.2(j), (ii) " _Total
Cash Consideration_ " means the aggregate cash consideration to be paid
pursuant to the Offer and the First Merger in respect of shares of Company
Common Stock, plus the Appraisal Cash Amount, and (iii) "
_Aggregate Consideration_ " means the sum of the Total Cash Consideration and
the Total Stock Consideration.

(e) _Effect of Second Merger_. At the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the
Second Merger and without any action on the part of any of the Parties or
holders of any securities of the First Surviving Corporation or of Merger Sub
2, (i) each member interest of Merger Sub 2 issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall remain outstanding as a
member interest of the Surviving Company and (ii) all shares of common stock
of the First Surviving Corporation shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist without any consideration
being payable therefor.

(f) _Company Stock Awards_. The Company shall take all requisite action so
that:

(i) _Company Stock Options_. At the First Effective Time, each option to
acquire shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") granted
under the Companys 2009 Equity Incentive Plan or the Companys 2013 Equity
Plan (the " _Company Stock Plans_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to
the First Effective Time (after giving effect to any vesting that is
contingent upon the completion of the Mergers) shall be converted into and
become an option to purchase Parent QVC Series A Stock, and Parent
shall assume such Company Stock Option converted as provided below in
accordance with substantially the same terms as those of the applicable
Company Stock Plan and the stock option notice and agreement by which such
Company Stock Option is evidenced, as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement (all such Company Stock Options are hereafter referred to as "
_Assumed Options_ "). All rights to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
under Assumed Options shall thereupon be converted into rights to purchase
Parent QVC Series A Stock as set forth herein. Accordingly,

 



12  from and after the First Effective Time: (A) each Assumed Option may be
exercised solely for shares of Parent QVC Series A Stock; (B) the number of
shares of Parent QVC Series A Stock subject to each Assumed Option shall be
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock that
were subject to such Assumed Option immediately prior to the First Effective
Time by the Conversion Ratio (as defined below), and rounding the resulting
number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent QVC Series A
Stock; (C) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent QVC Series A
Stock issuable upon exercise of each Assumed Option shall be determined by
dividing the per share exercise price of share of Company Common Stock subject
to such Assumed Option, as in effect immediately prior to the First Effective
Time, by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up
to the nearest whole cent; and (D) any restrictions on the exercise of any
Assumed Option shall continue in full force and effect and the term,
exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Assumed Option
shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption of such
Assumed Option; _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that: (1) each Assumed Option
shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as
appropriate to reflect any stock split, division or subdivision of shares,
stock dividend, issuance of bonus shares, reverse stock split, consolidation
of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction
with respect to Parent QVC Series A Stock subsequent to the First Effective
Time; (2) the compensation committee of the Parent Board shall succeed to the
authority and responsibility of the Company Board or any committee thereof
with respect to each Assumed Option; and (3) each Assumed Option shall be
subject to administrative procedures consistent with those in effect under
Parents equity compensation plan. For the purpose of this Section 2.1(f), the
" _Conversion Ratio_ " means an amount equal to (aa) the Initial Exchange
Ratio (or, if adjusted (x) pursuant to, and in compliance with, Section
1.1(c), the Initial Exchange Ratio, as so adjusted, or (y) pursuant to Section
2.1(d) (including at any time following an adjustment pursuant to Section
1.1(c)), the Adjusted Exchange Ratio) _plus_ (bb) a fraction having a
numerator equal to the Cash Consideration payable in respect of a share of
Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and having a denominator
equal to the volume weighted average closing sale price of one (1) share of
Parent QVC Series A Stock as reported on the Nasdaq over the ten (10)
consecutive trading day period ending on and including the second (2nd)
trading day prior to the First Effective Time (as adjusted as appropriate to
reflect any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, reorganizations,
reclassifications or similar events). The Parties hereto acknowledge that the
assumption of the Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.1(f)(i) is
intended to comply with the requirements of Treasury Regulations section
1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) for not treating such Assumed Option as the grant of a
new stock right or a change in the form of payment for purposes of Section
409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

 

(ii) _Restricted Stock Units_. At the First Effective Time, each restricted
stock unit granted under the Company Stock Plans (a " _Company RSU_ ") that
is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the First Effective Time
(after giving effect to any vesting that is contingent upon the completion of
the Mergers) shall be converted into and become a right to receive a
restricted stock unit with respect to Parent QVC Series A Stock, and Parent
shall assume such Company RSU award converted as provided below in accordance
with substantially the same terms as those of the applicable Company RSU award
and the agreement by which such Company RSU award is evidenced, as in effect
as of the date of this Agreement (all outstanding Company RSUs that are
assumed pursuant to this Section 2.1(f)(ii) are hereafter referred to as 

 



13  " _Assumed RSUs_ "). All rights to receive shares of Company Common Stock
under Assumed RSUs shall thereupon be converted into rights to receive
restricted stock units with respect to Parent QVC Series A Stock.
Accordingly, from and after the First Effective Time: (A) each Assumed RSU
award may be settled solely in shares of Parent QVC Series A Stock; (B) the
number of shares of Parent QVC Series A Stock subject to each Assumed RSU
award shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were subject to such Assumed RSU award immediately prior to
the First Effective Time by the Conversion Ratio (as defined in Section
2.1(f)(i)), and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number
of shares of Parent QVC Series A Stock; and (C) any performance and employment
conditions and restrictions on the receipt of any Assumed RSUs shall continue
in full force and effect and the term, vesting schedule and other provisions
of such Assumed RSUs shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the
assumption of such Assumed RSUs; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (1)
each Assumed RSU award shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to
further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, issuance of bonus shares, reverse stock
split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other
similar transaction with respect to Parent QVC Series A Stock subsequent to
the First Effective Time; (2) the compensation committee of the Parent Board
shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Company Board or any
committee thereof with respect to each Assumed RSU award; and (3) each Assumed
RSU award shall be subject to administrative procedures consistent with those
in effect under Parents equity compensation plan.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the
date of this Agreement until the earlier of (i) the First Effective Time or
(ii) any termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VII, the
outstanding shares of Parent QVC Series A Stock or Company Common Stock shall
have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by
reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment, or
other similar transaction, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with
a record date within said period, then the Initial Exchange Ratio (or, if
adjusted (x) pursuant to, and in compliance with, Section 1.1(c), the Initial
Exchange Ratio, as so adjusted, or (y) pursuant to Section 2.1(d) (including
at any time following an adjustment pursuant to Section 1.1(c)) the Adjusted
Exchange Ratio) and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be,
shall be appropriately adjusted to provide Parent and the holders of Company
Common Stock (including Company Stock Options exercisable for Company Common
Stock and Company RSUs) the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this Section 2.1 shall be construed
to permit any Party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or
restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

(h) Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary
action to (i) determine that none of the Company Stock Options or Company RSUs
that, in each case, is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the First
Effective Time, will accelerate and become vested in connection with the
Offer or the Mergers and (ii) effect the adjustment, assumption or, if
applicable, cancellation of the Company Stock Options or Company RSUs under
this Section 2.1. Parent shall reserve for future issuance a number of shares
of Parent QVC Series A Stock at least equal to the number of shares of Parent
QVC Series A Stock that will be subject to Assumed Options and Assumed RSUs as
a result of the actions contemplated by this

 



14  Section 2.1. As soon as practicable after the First Effective Time (but in
no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the First Effective
Time), Parent shall cause to be filed with the SEC a registration statement
on Form S-8 (or any successor form or other applicable form if a Form S-8 is
for any reason unavailable for use by Parent at such time), relating to the
shares of Parent QVC Series A Stock issuable with respect to such Assumed
Options and Assumed RSUs eligible for registration on Form S-8.

Section 2.2 _Disposition of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall mutually agree on a bank or trust company to act as Exchange
Agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") in connection with the First Merger for the
payment of the Cash Consideration and exchange of shares of Company Common
Stock for shares of Parent QVC Series A Stock. The Exchange Agent shall also
act as the agent for the Companys stockholders for the purpose of receiving
and holding their Certificates and Book Entry Shares and shall obtain no
rights or interests in the shares represented thereby. Parent will enter into
an exchange agent agreement with the Exchange Agent (the " _Exchange Agent
Agreement_ ") on terms reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company prior
to the First Effective Time and Parent shall pay all costs, fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the retention and engagement of the Exchange
Agent. Prior to or concurrently with the First Effective Time, Parent or
Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent
for payment in accordance with Section 2.1 and in exchange for outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (i) the aggregate Cash Consideration in
immediately available funds payable pursuant to Section 2.1, (ii) shares of
Parent QVC Series A Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 and (iii) cash in
immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to make all requisite
payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to Section
2.2(j). Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for payment in
accordance with Section 2.1 any dividends or other distributions which holders
of shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(k)
immediately following any such dividend or other distribution. All shares of
Parent QVC Series A Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant
hereto shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to make payments of the Cash Consideration,
and exchange shares of Company Common Stock for shares of Parent QVC Series A
Stock, out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement and the
Exchange Agent Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose.

(b) _Stock Transfer Books_. At the First Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of
the Company. From and after the First Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing ownership of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time
shall cease to have rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock
except as otherwise provided for herein. From and after the First Effective
Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Exchange Agent,
Parent or the Surviving Company for any reason (other than Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares representing Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE II.

 



15 (c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the First Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares that immediately prior to the First Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares and
Dissenting Shares) (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form prepared by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall pass to the Exchange Agent, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to
the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and as may be reasonably
acceptable to the Company) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to which the holder thereof
is entitled. Upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (1) the number of
whole shares of Parent QVC Series A Stock (after taking into account all
Certificates surrendered, and Book-Entry Shares held, by such holder of
record) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1 in book entry
form, (2) the Cash Consideration such holder is entitled to receive pursuant
to Section 2.1, (3) the cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
QVC Series A Stock such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
2.2(j), and (4) any dividends or distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(k), and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No
interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable pursuant to this Section
2.2.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed for twelve (12) months after the First Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent, and any holders of shares of Company Common
Stock prior to the First Effective Time who have not theretofore complied
with this ARTICLE II and the instructions in the letter of transmittal mailed
to such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(c) shall thereafter look only to Parent
and only as general creditors thereof for payment of the Transaction
Consideration issuable and payable in respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.1
and issuance and payment of any dividends or other distributions payable or
issuable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.2(k) (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws), and Parent or the Surviving Company (as
applicable) shall be responsible for the payment of such amounts.

 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Merger Subs, the Surviving Company,
the Company or the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent,
representative or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect
of the Transaction Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



16 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by the Surviving Company or Parent.
Any interest, gains and other income resulting from such investments shall be
the sole and exclusive property of Parent payable to Parent upon its request,
and no part of such interest, gains and other income shall accrue to the
benefit of holders of Company Common Stock. To the extent that there are
losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for
other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the Cash
Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore
the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through investments or other events so
as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level
sufficient to make such payments.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable and customary amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made with respect to such Certificate,
the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Transaction Consideration payable in respect thereof,
pursuant to this Agreement.

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Company, the Merger Subs, the First
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company and/or the Exchange Agent, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
applicable provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

 

(i) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
First Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) and held by a holder who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Transaction Consideration. Such holders shall be
entitled to receive such consideration as is determined to be due with
respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under the Appraisal Rights, then the right of such holder to be
paid such consideration as is determined to be due pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the First Effective Time into the right to receive, and to
have become exchangeable solely for, the Transaction Consideration, without
interest and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under
applicable Tax Law. The Company shall promptly deliver to Parent notice of
any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any

 



17  shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. The Company shall not without the prior written consent of
Parent make any payment with respect to, or offer to make any such payment or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

 

(j) _No Fractional Shares_.

 

(i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent QVC
Series A Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of
Parent QVC Series A Stock. For purposes of this Section 2.2(j), all
fractional shares to which a single record holder would be entitled shall be
aggregated and calculated to three (3) decimal places. In lieu of any such
fractional shares, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares shall be entitled to an
amount in cash, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law, rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the product
of (A) the amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Parent QVC
Series A Stock to which such holder is entitled under Section 2.1(c) (or would
be entitled but for this Section 2.2(j)) and (B) the volume weighted average
closing sale price of one (1) share of Parent QVC Series A Stock as reported
on the Nasdaq over the ten (10) consecutive trading day period ending on and
including the second (2nd) trading day prior to the Acceptance Time
(as adjusted as appropriate to reflect any stock splits, stock dividends,
combinations, reorganizations, reclassifications or similar events). As soon
as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be
paid to holders of shares of Company Common Stock in lieu of any fractional
share interests in Parent QVC Series A Stock, the Exchange Agent shall pay
such amounts, without interest, to the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock entitled to receive such cash.

 

(ii) The amount of cash each holder of Company Common Stock is entitled to
receive pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, for the
shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder, shall be rounded to the
nearest cent.

(k) _No Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent QVC Series A Stock with a record date after the First Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock with respect
to the shares of Parent QVC Series A Stock issuable upon surrender thereof,
and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such
holder pursuant to Section 2.2(j), and all such dividends and other
distributions shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall
be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with this ARTICLE II. Subject to applicable Law,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such
holder, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent QVC Series A Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(j) and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the First Effective
Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent QVC Series A
Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the First Effective Time but
prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender
payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent QVC Series A Stock.

  



18 Section 2.3 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time (x) after the First
Effective Time, the First Surviving Corporation or (y) after the Second
Effective Time, the Surviving Company, shall determine that any actions are
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the First Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company, as applicable, its
right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or
assets of either of the Company or Purchaser acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Company as a result of, or in connection with, the Mergers or
otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the sole member, officers and
directors, as applicable, of the First Surviving Corporation or the Surviving
Company, as applicable, shall be authorized to take all such actions as may
be necessary or desirable to vest all right, title or interest in, to and
under such rights, properties or assets in the First Surviving Corporation or
the Surviving Company, as applicable, or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement. 

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as (a) otherwise disclosed in a letter (the " _Company Disclosure
Letter_ ") delivered to Parent by the Company prior to the execution of this
Agreement (which Company Disclosure Letter shall in each case specifically
identify by reference to sections of this Agreement any exceptions to each of
the representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement,
with the understanding, however, that any disclosure in the Company Disclosure
Letter with respect to any particular representation, warranty or covenant
shall also qualify other representations, warranties and covenants if it
is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such information
is relevant to such representation, warranty or covenant) or (b) disclosed in
the Company SEC Documents (excluding exhibits and other information
incorporated therein) filed with, or furnished to, the SEC and publicly
available on the SECs EDGAR website not less than four (4) Business Days
prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding any risk factor disclosures
contained in the "Risk Factors" section thereof, any disclosure of risks
contained in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other
disclosure of risks or any other statements that are predictive or forward-
looking in nature); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any such disclosures in
such Company SEC Documents shall be deemed to qualify a representation or
warranty only if it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that
such information is relevant to such representation or warranty; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the disclosures in the Company SEC Documents shall not be
deemed to qualify any representations or warranties made in Section 3.3, 3.22
or 3.25, the Company represents and warrants to Parent and each Merger Sub as
follows:

Section 3.1 _Organization and Corporate Power_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted. The Company is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing as a
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business
or the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct
of its business requires such qualification or licensing necessary, except for
those jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or, where
relevant, licensed or to be in good standing, or to have such power or
authority, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



19 (b) The Company has made available to Parent correct and complete copies of
its Constituent Documents, as in effect on the date of this Agreement. The
Company is not in violation of any of its Constituent Documents.

(c) Section 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the

may be, and has all requisite corporate or other entity power and authority,
as the case may be, to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and
to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the failure to

individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Subsidiary is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing, if
applicable, in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions in which the failure to be

aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent correct and
complete copies of the Constituent Documents of each Company Subsidiary, as
in effect on the date of this Agreement. No Company Subsidiary is a
"significant subsidiary" (as such term is defined in Section 1-02 of
Regulation S-X of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "
_Exchange Act_ ")).

(c) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each grant

(e) There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other Indebtedness of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries having the right to vote (or
convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on
any matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote. There are no
stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or understandings
to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or of which the
Company has Knowledge with respect to the holding, voting, registration,
redemption, repurchase or disposition of, or that restricts the transfer of,
any Securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

or Section 412 of the Code, (ii) is a multiemployer plan within the meaning
of Section 3(37) of ERISA or (iii) a multiple employer welfare arrangement as
defined in Section 3(40) or ERISA.

 

(d) Each Qualified Plan has received from the Internal Revenue Service a
favorable determination letter (or in the case of a master or prototype plan,
a favorable opinion letter or in the case of a volume submitter plan, a
favorable advisory letter) as to its qualification under Section 401(a) of the
Code, and to the Knowledge of the Sellers and the Company, no event
of condition exists, whether by action or by failure to act, that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such
Qualified Plan. Each Company Benefit Plan has been maintained in compliance
with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes,
orders, rules and regulations, including ERISA and the Code, which are
applicable to such Company Benefit Plan. There are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened Proceedings against any Company Benefit
Plan, any fiduciary thereof, the Company or any Company Subsidiary other than
routine claims for benefits. With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, all
contributions, reimbursements and premium payments that are due have
been made, and all contributions, reimbursements and premium payments for any

fiduciary responsibility that could subject the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any officer of the Company or of any Company Subsidiary to any
material Tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by such Section
4975 of the Code or to any material liability under Section 502(i) or 502(1)

provisions of ERISA, the applicable requirements of the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations thereunder and
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended (" _PPACA_
"), and neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates have incurred any
liability under Section 4980 of the Code or the excise tax or penalty
provisions of PPACA. Except with respect to coverage through the end of the
month of termination of employment and to the extent required pursuant to
Section 4980B(f) of the Code and the corresponding provisions of ERISA, no
Company Benefit Plan provides retiree medical or retiree life insurance
benefits to any Person, and the Company is not contractually or otherwise
obligated (whether or not in writing) to provide any Person with life
insurance or medical benefits upon retirement or termination of employment.

(f) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any liability, including
any direct or indirect contingent liability, in connection with any Company
Benefit Plan that has been terminated prior to the date of Closing that could
subject Parent to any material liability. Each Company Benefit Plan may at any
time be unilaterally amended or terminated in its entirety, in accordance
with the terms thereof, without liability except as to benefits accrued
thereunder prior to such amendment or termination.

 

(g) Neither the execution nor delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby shall, whether alone or in
combination with any other event (i) result in the accelerated vesting or
payment of, or any increase in, or in the funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of, any compensation or benefits to any present or former employee,
officer, consultant, independent contractor or director of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries; (ii) result in the entitlement of any present or
former employee, officer, consultant, independent contractor or director of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to severance or termination
pay or benefits; or (iii) limit or restrict the right of the Company to merge,
amend or terminate any of the Company Benefit Plans; or (iv) result in any
payment under any of the Company Benefit Plans or any other arrangement that
would not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code or would be subject to
an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code.

 

(h) No current or former director, officer, employee, independent contractor
or consultant of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is entitled to receive
or will receive any gross-up or additional payment by reason of the
"additional tax" or "excise tax" required by Section 409A or 4999 of the Code
being imposed on such Person. Since January 1, 2005, each Company Benefit
Plan that is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan or arrangement has been
maintained in good faith operational compliance and, for all periods after
December 31, 2008, in documentary compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

(i) All Company Stock Options were duly authorized by the Company Board or an
appropriate committee thereof, including approval of the option exercise
price or the

 



30  methodology for determining the option exercise price and the substantive
option terms. No Company Stock Options were retroactively granted, and no
exercise price of any Company Stock Option was determined or reduced
retroactively. Any Company Stock Options that were designated as incentive
stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code met all
requirements for such designation, and the Company complied with all
reporting and withholding requirements with respect to the exercise of
Company Stock Options. The exercise price of all Company Stock Options was at

do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or other entity
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business
requires such qualification or licensing necessary, except for those
jurisdictions in which the failure to be so organized (other than Parent),
validly existing (other than Parent), qualified or, where relevant, licensed
or to be in good standing, or to have such power or authority, individually
or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

its Constituent Documents, as in effect on the date of this Agreement. Parent

and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Each Parent Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing, if applicable, in each jurisdiction in which the nature of

order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading (and no Parent SEC Document or
Subsidiary SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended or

(c) The consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC
Documents (including, in each case, any notes or schedules thereto) and all
related reports issued by Parents accountants with respect thereto (the "
_Parent SEC Financial Statements_ "), and the consolidated financial
statements of any Reporting Subsidiary included in the Subsidiary
SEC Documents (including, in each case, any notes or schedules thereto) and
all related compilations, reviews and other reports issued by such Reporting
Subsidiarys accountants with respect thereto (the " _Subsidiary SEC

their respective dates of filing with the SEC complied as to form in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) were prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved

financial statements of any Person other than Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries are required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial
statements of Parent. Except as required by GAAP and disclosed in the Parent
SEC Documents and the Subsidiary SEC Documents, between January 1, 2014 and
the date of this Agreement, none of Parent nor any Reporting Subsidiary has
made or adopted any material change in its accounting methods, practices or
policies.

provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of the Nasdaq.

and maintained disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15
under the Exchange Act) as required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act. Each of Parents and the Reporting Subsidiarys disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that all information (both
financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by Parent or such
Reporting Subsidiary in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to Parents or the Reporting
Subsidiarys, as applicable, management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parents
management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Parents
disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent required by applicable
Law, presented in any applicable Parent SEC Document that is a report on
Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by such report or amendment based on such evaluation. Based on
Parents managements most recently completed evaluation of Parents internal
control over financial reporting and the Reporting Subsidiarys managements
most recently completed evaluation of the Reporting Subsidiarys
internal control over financial reporting, (i) Parent and the Reporting
Subsidiary had no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the
design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect their ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) Parent does not
have Knowledge of any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in Parents or

 



44  the Reporting Subsidiarys internal control over financial reporting. Since
January 1, 2014, to the Knowledge of Parent, no executive officer or director
of Parent or any Reporting Subsidiary has received or otherwise had or
obtained knowledge of, and to the Knowledge of Parent, no auditor, accountant,
or representative of Parent or any Reporting Subsidiary has provided written
notice to Parent or such Reporting Subsidiary or any executive officer or
director of, any substantive complaint or allegation that Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in improper accounting practices. Since January 1,
2014, to the Knowledge of Parent, no attorney representing Parent or any of
the Parent Subsidiaries has reported to the Parent Board or any committee
thereof or to any current director or executive officer of Parent evidence of
a material violation of United States or other securities Laws or breach of
fiduciary duty by Parent or any Reporting Subsidiary or any of their
respective executive officers or directors.

(g) Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether absolute or contingent, asserted or
unasserted, known or unknown, primary or secondary, direct or indirect, and
whether or not accrued) of the type required to be set forth in the
"liabilities" column of a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP or in
the notes thereto, except (i) those that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, (ii) as reflected or reserved against in the most recent
audited balance sheet included in the Parent SEC Financial Statements or the
notes thereto, (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices since the date of the most
recent balance sheet included in the Parent SEC Financial Statements and (iv)
for liabilities and obligations arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement, the Offer or the Mergers. Neither Parent nor any of the
Parent Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to,
any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract or
arrangement (including any Contract or arrangement relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among Parent and any of the Parent
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand, or any material "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in
Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose
or intended effect of such Contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of
any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any
of the Parent Subsidiaries in the Parent SEC Financial Statements or other
Parent SEC Documents.

Except as expressly contemplated or permitted by this Agreement, as required
by Law or as set forth in Section 5.2 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, during
the period from the date of this Agreement to the First Effective Time, unless
the Company otherwise agrees in writing (which agreement shall not be

its Subsidiaries to, conduct its business in all material respects in the

an Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) request the prompt return or destruction of
all confidential information previously made available by it or on its behalf
to any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates) who executed a Company

Company Subsidiary or any of their respective controlled Affiliates is a party
with any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates) with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or any proposal, inquiry or offer that would reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the
provisions of any such agreement, including seeking injunctions to prevent
any breaches of any such agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall
be entitled to waive any standstill provision included in any
such confidentiality agreement or any standstill provision contained in any
standstill agreement to which the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of
their respective controlled Affiliates is a party

 



52  with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any proposal, inquiry or offer
that is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal if the Company
Board determines that failure to waive such standstill would constitute a
breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(b) Subject to the other terms of this Section 5.3, the Company shall not,
and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective
directors and officers not to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the making, submission
or announcement of any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer
constituting or that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) furnish any non-public information regarding any of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary to any Person (other than Parent, its Affiliates and

connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal,
inquiry or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition

inquiry or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, (v) make or authorize any public statement, recommendation or
solicitation in support of any Acquisition Proposal or any proposal, inquiry

Person (other than the Companys Representatives) in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, discussion, offer or request that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time, (i) the Company receives, after the date of
this Agreement, a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal that was not
solicited after the date of this Agreement, (ii) such Acquisition Proposal did
not result from a breach of Section 5.3(a) or Section 5.3(b) of this
Agreement, (iii) the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor, each of nationally
recognized reputation) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (iv) the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that
the failure to take the actions referred to in clause (x) or (y) of this
Section 5.3(c) would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, then, prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company may (x) make
available information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
to the Person (and its or their directors, officers and Representatives and
potential financing sources) making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that any nonpublic
information provided or made available to any Person given such access shall
have been previously provided or made available to Parent or shall be provided
or made available to Parent prior to or concurrently with the time it is
provided or made available to such Person, and (y) participate in discussions
or negotiations with the Person (and its or their directors, officers and
Representatives and potential financing sources) making such

 



53  Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause its
and their respective directors and officers to, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, cease any activities
described in clause (x) or (y) of this Section 5.3(c) immediately following
the time that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel and a financial advisor, each of nationally recognized
reputation) that the applicable Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal. The Company
shall promptly (and in any event within thirty-six (36) hours) advise Parent
of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (including the
identity of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal,
proposal or offer, and the material terms and conditions thereof) that is made
or submitted by any Person prior to the Acceptance Time; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Company shall not be required to provide Parent or
Purchaser with the identity of the Person submitting such Acquisition
Proposal, proposal or offer or the details of any such Acquisition Proposal,
proposal or offer made or submitted pursuant to any Company NDA so long as
the only communications between the Company or any of its directors, officers
or Representatives and such Person relate to (A) such Person being informed of
the Companys obligations under Section 5.3 and (B) requests that such Person
waive any provision of such Company NDA that prohibits the Company from
complying with the terms of this Section 5.3(c). The Company shall keep Parent
informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status of, and any financial
or other material changes in, any such Acquisition Proposal, proposal or
offer, including furnishing copies of all offer letters, term sheets, written
proposals or similar documents, in each case, offering or proposing to effect
an Acquisition Proposal, and any draft agreements to effect the applicable
Acquisition Proposal, proposal or offer exchanged between the Company and the
other party making the Acquisition Proposal, proposal or offer.

 

(d) Subject to the other terms of this Section 5.3, neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) fail to make, withhold, withdraw or
qualify (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent) the Company Recommendation,
the Company Determination or the approval of this Agreement, the Offer or any
of the other transactions contemplated hereby or (B) adopt, approve or
recommend or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,

Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with Section 5.3, (iii)
take any action to make the provisions of any Takeover Laws or any
restrictive provision of any applicable antitakeover provision in the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, inapplicable to any
transactions contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal (including approving any
transaction under the DGCL) or (iv) resolve, agree or propose to take any such
actions (each such action set forth in Section 5.3(d)(i) and Section
5.3(d)(ii) being referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_
"), it being understood that the following shall not constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change: (A) any "stop, look and listen" disclosure in
compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act and (B) any communication
by the Company that expressly continues to recommend the Offer.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject
to Section 5.3(f) and Section 5.3(g), at any time prior to the Acceptance
Time, if the Company

 



54  Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel of
nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would constitute a
breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then, prior to the
Acceptance Time, the Company Board may (i) make an Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to an Intervening Event (other than for an Acquisition
Proposal) or (ii) (solely in response to a Superior Proposal received on or
after the date hereof that has not been withdrawn or abandoned and that did
not result from a breach of Section 5.3(a) or Section 5.3(b) of this
Agreement), make an Adverse Recommendation Change and, on or after the Cut-
Off Date, terminate this Agreement in order to enter into a definitive
agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(d)(iii). Neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall make an Adverse Recommendation Change or
(solely in response to a Superior Proposal received on or after the date
hereof that has not been withdrawn or abandoned and that did not result from a
breach of Section 5.3(a) or Section 5.3(b) of this Agreement) terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(d)(iii) unless the Company has first
complied with the provisions of Section 5.3(f) and, after so complying, the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel of nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and, in the
case of an Adverse Recommendation Change or termination pursuant to Section
5.3(e)(ii), such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal.

(f) The Company Board shall not take any action set forth in (i) Section
5.3(e)(i) unless the Company has first (A) provided Parent four (4) Business
Days prior written notice advising Parent it intends to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change which notice specifies, in reasonable detail, the
reasons therefor (it being understood that the delivery of such notice shall
not itself constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), and (B) during such
four (4) Business Day period, negotiated, and has caused its Representatives
to negotiate, in good faith any written proposal by Parent to amend the terms
and conditions of this Agreement in a manner that would obviate the need to
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and (C) after complying with clauses
(A) and (B) of this Section 5.3(f)(i), at the end of such four (4) Business
Day period, the Company Board has again reaffirmed the determination described
in Section 5.3(e) in light of the revisions to the terms of this Agreement to
which Parent has committed in a binding written document or (ii) Section
5.3(e)(ii) unless (A) the Company has first provided written notice to Parent
(a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") advising Parent that the Company has
received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal, identifying the Person making such Superior Proposal
and providing copies of any proposed agreements which are intended to effect
such Superior Proposal, and the Company Board has made the determination
required under Section 5.3(e) (it being understood that the delivery of such
notice shall not itself constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), (B) the
Company has negotiated, and caused the Company and its Representatives to
negotiate, during the four (4) Business Day period following Parents receipt
of the Notice of Superior Proposal (the " _Notice Period_ "), in good faith
with Parent any written proposal to amend the terms of this Agreement (to the
extent Parent wishes to do so) so that such Acquisition Proposal no longer
constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (C) after complying with clauses (A) and
(B) of this Section 5.3(f)(ii), the Company Board has again reaffirmed the
determination described in Section 5.3(e) in light of the revisions to the
terms of this Agreement to which Parent has committed in a binding written
document; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any revisions are made to an
Acquisition Proposal and such revisions are material (it being understood and
agreed that any change to consideration with respect to such proposal is
material), the Company shall deliver a new Notice 

 



55  of Superior Proposal to Parent and shall again comply with the requirements
of this Section 5.3(f)(ii) with respect to such new Notice of Superior
Proposal, except that in such a situation, the Notice Period shall be two (2)
Business Days (it being understood that if any subsequent material revisions
are made to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall deliver a new Notice
of Superior Proposal to Parent and shall again comply with the requirements
of this Section 5.3(f)(ii) with respect to such new Notice of Superior
Proposal, except that the Notice Period with respect thereto shall be two (2)
Business Days).

 

(g) The Company agrees that it shall take all actions necessary so that any
Adverse Recommendation Change shall not change the approval of this Agreement
or any other approval of the Company Board or any committee thereof in any
respect that would have the effect of causing any of the Takeover Laws of any
state (including Delaware) to be applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Mergers.

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Company Board
from taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A, Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act or making any disclosure to its stockholders required pursuant to
applicable Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure (other
than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to
be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly
reaffirms the Company Recommendation and rejects any Acquisition Proposal that
has not then been withdrawn within three (3) Business Days after such
disclosure; _provided_ ,  _further_ that neither the Company nor the Company
Board (or any committee thereof) shall be permitted to recommend that the
stockholders of the Company tender any securities in connection with any
tender or exchange offer other than the Offer (or otherwise approve, endorse
or recommend any Acquisition Proposal), unless in each case, in connection
therewith, the Company Board effects an Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with Section 5.3(e).

(i) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a customary
confidentiality agreement containing terms substantially similar to, and

56  Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (C) issuance, sale
or other disposition, directly or indirectly, to any Person (or the

transaction in which the holders of the voting power of the Company
immediately prior to such transaction own 85% or less of the voting power of
the Company immediately following the transaction, (E) transaction in which

clauses (A) through (F), other than the Offer and the Mergers).

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any binding _bona fide_ written offer
made by a third party or group pursuant to which such third party or group
would own, directly or indirectly, 66% or more of the combined voting power of

of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (A) on terms which the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be more favorable
from a financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company than the
Transactions, taking into account any factors that the Company Board deems
appropriate, including (to the extent deemed by the Company Board to be
appropriate for consideration) the terms and conditions of such proposal and
this Agreement (including the Termination Fee, any changes proposed by Parent
to the terms of this Agreement and the potential time delay and all
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such offer), and (B) that is
reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such offer, including the likelihood of
any necessary financing (including with respect to any indebtedness that

(j) Any action taken or not taken by any officer or director of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any financial advisor of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that if taken or not taken by the Company would constitute a
breach of this Section 5.3, shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement by the
Company; _provided_ , _however,_ that, without limiting in any way the terms
of this Section 5.3, if the Company has instructed in writing promptly, after
the date of this Agreement, its and the Company Subsidiaries financial

or not taken by any such financial advisors shall be considered for purposes
of Section 7.1(c)(i) or Section 7.1(c)(iii) unless one or more of the officers
or directors of the Company or of any of the Company Subsidiaries
has directly or indirectly authorized or directed such financial advisors to
take such action or any similar action; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall remain liable for the actions of such financial
advisors. If the Company becomes aware of any action taken or not taken by
any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that if taken or
not taken by the Company would constitute a breach of this Section 5.3, the

of any written notice to the receiving Party from any third Person alleging
that the consent or approval of such third Person is or may be required in
connection with the Offer, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated

delay the consummation of the Offer, the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) receipt of any notice or
other communication from any Governmental Entity or the Nasdaq (or any other
securities market) regarding the Offer, the Mergers and the other transactions

transition planning with management-level employees) to its and its
Subsidiaries properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and to
its and its Subsidiaries officers, management-level employees, accountants,
counsel and other representatives and, during such period, each Party shall
promptly make available to the other Party, subject, in the case of

registration statement and other document filed by it during such period

information concerning its business, properties and personnel, in the case of
each of clauses (i) and (ii), as the other Party may reasonably request. All
access and investigation pursuant to this Section 5.7(a) shall be conducted at
the requesting Partys expense and in such a manner as not to unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of the other Party and its

that in the reasonable, good faith judgment of such Party (i) is competitively
sensitive, (ii) would reasonably be expected to result in any violation of
any material Contract or Law to which such Party is a party or is subject,

negotiations that the Company or any of its directors, officers or
Representatives is having, consistent with the terms of this Agreement, with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any other proposals or offers that
could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,
that the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in
seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of the information otherwise
withheld under clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Section 5.7(c) to the
extent doing so (A) would not (in the good faith belief of the disclosing
Party) reasonably be expected to result in the violation of any such material
Contract or Law or reasonably be expected to cause such privilege to be
undermined with respect to such information or (B) could reasonably (in the
good faith belief of the disclosing party) be managed through the use of
any "clean-room" arrangements agreed between the Parties pursuant to which
non-employee Representatives of the non-disclosing Party shall be provided
access to such information; _provided_ , _further_ , that (x) the
disclosing Party shall notify the other Party that such disclosures would
reasonably be expected to violate the disclosing Partys or its Subsidiaries

Section 5.7 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to require the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective directors, officers

other information.

Section 5.8 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including Section
5.16), each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal
requirements which may be imposed on such Party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Offer and the Mergers and, subject to the conditions set forth
in Article VI hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Offer and the Mergers, as promptly as practicable and
(ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other Party to obtain) any consent,

Entity which is required to be obtained by Parent or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Offer and the Mergers
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to comply with the
terms and conditions of any such consent, authorization, order or approval. To
the extent necessary in order to accomplish the foregoing, Parent and the
Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to jointly propose,
negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or disposition of, or prohibition
or limitation on the ownership or operation by Parent and the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries of, any portion of the business, properties
or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor the Company shall be required
to propose, commit to or effect any action that is not conditioned upon the
consummation of the Offer or the Mergers.

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, as soon as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, including
using reasonable best efforts to lift or rescind any injunction or
restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the
Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and using
reasonable best efforts to defend any litigation seeking to enjoin, prevent
or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeking
material damages.

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in Section 5.8(a) to obtain all waiting period expirations or
terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations,
approvals, permits, and authorizations for the

 



60  Transactions under the HSR Act, use reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate
and consult with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including by allowing the
other Party to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and comment
on drafts of filings and submissions; (ii) promptly inform the other Party of
any material communication received by such Party from, or given by such
Party to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "),
the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or any other Governmental Entity,
by promptly providing copies to the other Party of any such written
communications, in each case regarding any of the Transactions; and (iii)
permit the other Party to review in advance any material communication that it
gives to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting, substantive
telephone call or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental
Entity and, to the extent permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or any other
applicable Governmental Entity, give the other Party the opportunity to
attend and participate in any in-person meetings with the DOJ, the FTC or any
other Governmental Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials required to
be provided pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) may be redacted (A) to
remove references concerning the valuation of Parent, the Company or any of
their Subsidiaries, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements,
and (C) as necessary to address privilege or confidentiality concerns.

 

Section 5.9 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect
of, acts or omissions occurring prior to the First Effective Time now existing
in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries and any person who becomes a director or officer of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries prior to the First Effective Time
(collectively, together with their respective heirs, executors and
administrators, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in their respective
Constituent Documents or any indemnification or similar agreements shall
survive the Mergers and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to comply
therewith. From and after the First Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Company to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the Indemnified Parties against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
claim or Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or related to the fact that such person is or was a director
or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and pertaining to matters
existing or occurring or actions or omissions taken prior to the First
Effective Time, including (A) the Transactions, and (B) actions to enforce
this Section 5.9 or any other indemnification or advancement right of any
Indemnified Party. In addition, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Company to, advance expenses to the Indemnified Parties as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law; _provided_ that the Indemnified
Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined by a final and nonappealable judicial
determination that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.
For a period of no less than six (6) years from the First Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to maintain in effect the
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the
Companys Constituent Documents or any indemnification or similar agreements
in effect as of the date of this Agreement between any Indemnified Party and
the Company or any Company 

 



61  Subsidiary that are set forth in Section 5.9(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such
Indemnified Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any Proceeding
pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until
the final disposition of such Proceeding.

(b) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Company or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties, rights and other assets to any Person, then, and in each
such case, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, cause
proper provision to be made so that such successor or assign shall expressly
assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.

(c) Prior to the First Effective Time the Company may, and if the Company does
not, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company as of immediately following the
Second Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay for, at no expense to the
beneficiaries, non-cancellable "tail" insurance policies with a claims period
of at least six (6) years from and after the First Effective Time from
insurance carriers with the same or better credit ratings as the Companys
current insurance carriers with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively,
" _D andO Insurance_"), for the persons who are covered by the Companys
existing DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of
coverage at least as favorable to the insured individuals as the Companys
existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the First Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the Company pay, or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, be
required to pay, for such "tail" insurance policies a one-time premium in
excess of 300% of the Companys current annual premium for DandO Insurance (the
" _Premium Cap_ "). If the Company and the Surviving Company for any reason
fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the First Effective Time,
the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to,
continue to maintain in effect, at no expense to the beneficiaries, DandO
Insurance for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the First
Effective Time for the persons who are covered by the Companys existing DandO
Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least
as favorable as provided in such existing DandO Insurance, from insurance
carriers with the same or better credit ratings as the Companys current DandO
Insurance carriers; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Company shall
not be required to pay for such DandO Insurance an annual premium in excess of
Premium Cap, in which case the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Surviving Company to maintain in
effect, at no expense to the beneficiaries, for a period of at least six (6)
years from the First Effective Time for the persons who are covered by the
Companys existing DandO Insurance, DandO Insurance with the best overall terms,
conditions, retentions and levels of coverage reasonably available for an
annual premium equal to the Premium Cap.

 

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive consummation of the Offer
and the Mergers, are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each

 



62  Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and are
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have under the
Constituent Documents of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, by Contract,
by Law or otherwise.

Section 5.10  _Termination of Certain Agreements_. The Company shall use
reasonable efforts to cause to be terminated, effective as of immediately
prior to the First Effective Time, that certain Third Amended and Restated

No. 1, dated October 17, 2013, among the Company and the other parties
thereto.

 

Section 5.11 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) For a period commencing on the First Effective Time, and ending on the
first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, each employee of the Company and
its Subsidiaries who remains in the active employment of the Surviving Company
and its Subsidiaries (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") shall receive an annual
rate of salary or wages and annual incentive opportunities, and employee
benefits (other than equity-based awards) that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than the annual rate of salary or wages and annual incentive
opportunities, and employee benefits (other than equity-based awards) provided
by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement.

 

(b) For a period commencing on the First Effective Time, and ending on the
first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent or the Surviving Company,
as applicable, shall provide or cause to be provided, to each Continuing
Employee whose employment is terminated by the Company for reasons other than
cause, death or disability, severance benefits that are no less favorable than
severance benefits set forth in Section 5.11(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

 

(c) As of the First Effective Time, Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its and any of its Subsidiaries third party
insurance providers or third party administrators to waive all limitations as
to any pre-existing condition or waiting periods in its applicable welfare
plans with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
each Continuing Employee under any welfare plans that such employees may be
eligible to participate in after the First Effective Time, other than
limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such
employees and that have not been satisfied as of the First Effective Time
under any comparable employee benefit plan. In addition, as of the First
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company and any
applicable Company Subsidiary to, give Continuing Employees full credit for
purposes of eligibility and vesting (but, not for benefit accrual purposes
under any defined benefit pension plan) under any employee benefit and
compensation plans or arrangements maintained by Parent or an
applicable Parent Subsidiary that such employees may be eligible to
participate in after the First Effective Time for such Continuing Employees
service with the Company or any Company Subsidiaries to the same extent that
such service was credited for purposes of any comparable employee benefit
plan immediately prior to the First Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.11(c) shall be construed to require
crediting of service that would result in (i) duplication of benefits, (ii)
service credit for benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan, or
(iii) service credit under a newly established plan for which prior service is
not taken into account for employees of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
generally.

(d) No provision of this Section 5.11 shall be construed as a limitation on
the right of Parent, or to cause any Parent Subsidiary, to amend or terminate
any specific employee benefit plan that Parent or a Parent Subsidiary would
otherwise have under the terms of such employee benefit plan, nor shall any
provision of this Section 5.11 be construed to require the continuation of
the employment of any particular Continuing Employee. The provisions of this
Section 5.11 are solely for the benefit of the Parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former director, officer, employee, consultant or other
independent contractor or any other Person shall be a third-party beneficiary
of this Section 5.11, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to
any employee benefit plan of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or other
compensation or benefit plan or arrangement for any purpose.

listing of additional shares (or such other form as may be required) with

connection with the Offer and the First Merger (including the Parent QVC
Series A Stock to be issued upon the exercise of Assumed Options and upon the
settlement of Assumed RSUs) and such other shares of Parent QVC Series A Stock
to be reserved for issuance in connection with the Offer and the First Merger,

(including derivative securities with respect to Parent QVC Series A Stock)
resulting from the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 5.14 _Security Holder Litigation_. In the event that any litigation
related to this Agreement, the Mergers, the Offer or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is brought against the Company and/or its
directors by security holders of the Company, the Company shall promptly
notify Parent of such litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably informed on
a current basis with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate, subject to a customary joint defense
agreement, in, but not control, the defense and settlement of any such
litigation against the Company and/or its directors by security holders of
the Company and no such settlement shall be agreed to by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary without Parents prior written consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 5.15 _Antitakeover Statute_. If any Takeover Law is or may become
applicable to this Agreement (including the Mergers, the Offer and the other
Transactions contemplated

 



64  hereby), each of the Company, Parent and each Merger Sub and their
respective boards of directors or member, as applicable, shall grant all such
approvals and take all such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the

terms contemplated hereby, and otherwise act reasonably to eliminate or

contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall
survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms (and

would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails
promptly to pay the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3, and, in order
to obtain such payment, Parent or its designee commences a suit that results
in a judgment against the Company for all or a portion of the Termination Fee,
the Company shall pay to Parent or its designees interest on the amount of the
Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the
date of payment at a rate equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date such overdue
amount was originally required to be paid.

Section 7.4 _Amendment or Supplement_. This Agreement may be amended, modified
or supplemented by the Parties hereto by action taken or authorized by
written agreement of the Parties hereto (by action taken by their respective
boards of directors, if required) at any time prior to the First Effective
Time, whether before or after the Acceptance Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after the Acceptance Time, no amendment shall be made that pursuant to
applicable Law requires further approval or adoption by the stockholders of
the Company without such further approval or adoption. This Agreement may not
be amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of
conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically
designated as an amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each of the Parties

respective boards of directors, if required), to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or acts of the other Party or Parties hereto, as applicable, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
Party or Parties set forth in this Agreement or any document delivered

be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires further approval or adoption
by the stockholders of the Company without such further approval or adoption.
Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly
authorized officer on behalf of such Party or Parties, as applicable. No
failure or delay of any Party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
enforce such right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. Except
as otherwise provided herein, the rights and remedies of the Parties
hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which
they would otherwise have hereunder.

enforceable by each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and his or her

74 Section 8.5 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy,
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon such determination that any term,
provision, covenant or restriction is invalid, void, unenforceable or against

modify this Agreement so as to effect the agreement of the Parties as closely
as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are

Annexes attached hereto or referred to herein, and the Company Disclosure
Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, are hereby incorporated in and made a

interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
hereto in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any such assignment

that the Merger Subs may assign in their sole discretion and without the
consent of any other party, any or all of their rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or the
Merger Subs of their obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

in the federal courts, any federal court located in the State of Delaware
without proof of actual damages or otherwise (and each Party hereby waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally (a) submits to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Court of Chancery (or if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware) in respect of the interpretation and enforcement
of the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) agrees
