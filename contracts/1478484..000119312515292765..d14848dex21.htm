Stock accepted by Purchaser in accordance with the terms of the Offer shall, subject to the adjustments set forth in Section&nbsp;2.1(d) and Section&nbsp;2.1(g), be exchanged for the right to receive the Transaction Consideration. Subject to the

Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered for settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee) as soon as practicable after Purchaser is permitted to do so under applicable Law (the

Offer shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash and shares of Parent QVC Series A Stock, subject to reduction for any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect thereof. The Company shall register (and shall instruct its transfer agent to
register) the transfer of the shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment by Purchaser effective immediately after the Acceptance Time. </P>
