geographical area and scope) and necessary to protect the legitimate
interests of Sellers and the Companies, including the preservation of the
business of the Companies, and that violation or breach of this _Section 7.6_
will cause substantial and irreparable harm to Sellers and the Companies that
would not be quantifiable and for which no adequate remedy would exist at Law.

unenforceability will have the power to reduce the scope, duration or area of
the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace any
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is
valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention
of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement will be
enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the
judgment may be appealed.

the preceding sentence are given in a timely manner. Any written notice will
state in reasonable detail the basis for such Sellers Losses to the extent
then known by Sellers and the nature of Sellers Loss for which
indemnification is sought, and it may state the amount of Sellers Loss
claimed. If such written notice (or an amended notice) states the amount of

(20) Business Days after delivery of such notice by Sellers whether Buyer
disputes the claim described in such notice, Sellers Loss in the amount
specified in Sellers' notice will be admitted by Buyer, and Buyer will pay the
amount of such Sellers Loss. If Buyer has timely disputed its liability with
respect to such claim, Buyer and Sellers will proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute. If a written notice does not state the
amount of Sellers Loss claimed, such omission will not preclude Sellers from
recovering from Buyer the amount of Sellers Loss with respect to the claim
described in such notice if any such amount is promptly provided once
determined. In order to assert its right to indemnification under this 
_Article XI_, Sellers will not be required to provide any notice except as
provided in this _Section 11.2(d)_.

  



  

11.3 _Third-Party Action._

  



  

(a) Sellers agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Buyer and each Company and their officers and directors
(collectively, the " _ _Buyer Indemnified Parties__ ") against any Loss
arising from, relating to or constituting any Litigation instituted by any
third party arising out of the actions or inactions of Sellers or the
Companies (or allegations thereof) with respect to which the Seller is
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, (any such third-
party action or proceeding being referred to as a " _ _Third-Party Action__
"). A Buyer Indemnified Party will give Sellers prompt written notice of the
commencement of a Third-Party Action. The complaint or other papers pursuant
to which the third party commenced such Third-Party Action will be attached
to such written notice. The failure to give prompt written notice will not
affect any Buyer Indemnified Party's right to indemnification unless such
failure has materially and adversely affected Sellers' ability to defend
successfully such Third-Party Action.

  



  

(b) Sellers will contest and defend such Third-Party Action on
behalf of any Buyer Indemnified Party that requests that they do so.
Notice of the intention to so contest and defend will be given by Sellers to
the requesting Buyer Indemnified Party within twenty (20) Business Days after
the Buyer Indemnified Party's notice of such Third-Party Action (but, in all
events, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date that a response to
such Third-Party Action is due to be filed). Such contest and defense will
be conducted by reputable attorneys retained by Sellers. A Buyer Indemnified
Party will be entitled at any time, at its own cost and expense, to
participate in such contest and defense and to be represented by attorneys of
its own choosing. If the Buyer Indemnified Party elects to participate in
such defense, the Buyer Indemnified Party will cooperate with Sellers in the
conduct of such defense. A Buyer Indemnified Party will cooperate with
Sellers to the extent reasonably requested by Sellers in the contest and
defense of such Third-Party Action, including providing reasonable access
(upon reasonable notice) to the books, records and employees of the Buyer
Indemnified Party if relevant to the defense of such Third-Party Action;
_provided_ , that such cooperation will not unduly disrupt the operations of
the business of the Buyer Indemnified Party or cause the Buyer Indemnified
Party to waive any statutory or common law privileges, breach any
confidentiality obligations owed to third parties or otherwise cause any
Confidential Information of such Buyer Indemnified Party to become public.

  



    

 | 46| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) If any Buyer Indemnified Party does not request that Sellers
contest and defend a Third-Party Action or if a Buyer Indemnified
Party reasonably determines that Sellers are not adequately representing or,
because of a conflict of interest, may not adequately represent any interests
of the Buyer Indemnified Party at any time after requesting Sellers to do so,
a Buyer Indemnified Party will be entitled to conduct its own defense and to
be represented by attorneys of its own choosing all at Sellers' cost and
expense. Sellers will pay in as incurred (no later than twenty-five (25) days
after presentation) the fees and expenses of the counsel retained by such
Buyer Indemnified Party.

  



  

(d) Neither a Buyer Indemnified Party nor Sellers may concede,
settle or compromise any Third-Party Action without the consent of the
other party, which consents will not be unreasonably withheld.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if a Third-Party Action seeks the issuance
of an injunction, the specific election of an obligation or similar remedy or
(ii) if the subject matter of a Third-Party Action relates to the ongoing
business of any Buyer Indemnified Party, which Third-Party Action, if decided
against any Buyer Indemnified Party, would materially adversely affect the
ongoing business or reputation of any Buyer Indemnified Party, the Buyer
Indemnified Party alone will be entitled to settle such Third-Party Action in
the first instance and, if the Buyer Indemnified Party does not settle such
Third-Party Action, Sellers will then have the right to contest and defend
(but not settle) such Third-Party Action.

  



  

11.4 _Survival_. (a) All Sellers representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or in any certificate or
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement will survive the Closing, for
a period of 24 months after the Closing Date and (b) all
Buyer representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, any
Ancillary Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered pursuant to
this Agreement will survive the Closing, for a period of 24 months after the
Closing Date.

  



  

11.5 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Prior to or in connection with the
Closing, the parties will have available to them all remedies available under
Law, including specific performance. After the Closing, the rights set forth
in _Sections 11.1_, _11.2_ and, to the extent applicable, _11.2(d)_ will be
the exclusive remedy for breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations
and warranties contained in _Article III_ through Article V of this
Agreement occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, but the parties
otherwise will have available to them all other remedies available under Law,
including specific performance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this Agreement will prevent any party from bringing an action based upon
allegations of fraud or intentional misrepresentation by the other party in
connection with this Agreement. In the event such action is brought, the
prevailing party's attorneys' fees and costs will be paid by the non-
prevailing party.

  



  

Article XII General

  



  

12.1 _Press Releases and Announcements_. Any public announcement,
including any announcement to employees, customers or suppliers and
others having dealings with the Companies, or similar publicity with respect
to this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, will be issued, if at all, at such time and in such manner as both
Buyer and Sellers determine and approve. Both Buyer and Sellers will have the
right to be present for any in-person announcement. Unless consented by both
Buyer and Sellers or required by Law, Buyer and Sellers will keep, and
Sellers will cause each of the Companies to keep, this Agreement, the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement confidential.

  



    

 | 47| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

12.2 _Expenses_. Except as set forth in Section 5.5 or otherwise
expressly provided for in this Agreement, Sellers, on the one hand, and
Buyer, on the other hand, will each pay all expenses incurred by each of them
(and, in the case of Sellers, the expenses incurred by any of the Companies
and Sellers) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including legal, accounting, investment banking and consulting
fees and expenses incurred in negotiating, executing and delivering this
Agreement and the other agreements, exhibits, documents and instruments
contemplated by this Agreement (whether the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated or not).

  



  

12.3 _Further Assurances_. On and after the Closing Date, Sellers
will take all appropriate action and execute any documents, instruments or
conveyances of any kind that may be reasonably requested by Buyer to carry out
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

12.4 _Amendment and Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended, nor
may any provision of this Agreement or any default, misrepresentation,
or breach of warranty or agreement under this Agreement be waived, except in
a writing executed by the party against which such amendment or waiver is
sought to be enforced. Neither the failure nor any delay by any Person in
exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will operate as
a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise
of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further
exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege. In addition, no course of dealing between or among
any persons having any interest in this Agreement will be deemed effective to
modify or amend any part of this Agreement or any rights or obligations of any
person under or by reason of this Agreement. The rights and remedies of the
parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative.

  



  

12.5 _Notices_. All notices, demands and other communications to be
given or delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement
will be in writing and will be deemed to have been given (i) when delivered
if personally delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (ii)
when received if sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier service
(receipt requested), (iii) five (5) Business Days after being mailed, if sent
by first class mail, return receipt requested, or (iv) when receipt is
acknowledged by an affirmative act of the party receiving notice, if sent by
facsimile, telecopy or other electronic transmission device (provided that
such an acknowledgement does not include an acknowledgment generated
automatically by a facsimile or telecopy machine or other electronic
transmission device). Notices, demands and communications to Buyer and Sellers
will, unless another address is specified in writing, be sent to the address
indicated below:

12.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any party to this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties to this
Agreement, except that Buyer may assign any of its rights under this
Agreement to any Subsidiary of Buyer, so long as it remains responsible for
the performance of all of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to
the foregoing, this Agreement and all of the provisions of this Agreement will
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  



  

12.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing expressed or referred to
in this Agreement confers any rights or remedies upon any Person that is not
a party or permitted assign of a party to this Agreement.

  



    

 | 49| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

12.8 _Severability_. In addition to the severability provisions of
_Section 12.8_, whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law,
but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid
under applicable Law, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent of
such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such
provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

12.9 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement and when executed and delivered the Ancillary Agreements,
contain the complete agreement between the parties and supersede any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or between the parties,
written or oral.

  



  

12.10 _Schedules_. The Disclosure Schedule contains a series of
schedules corresponding to the sections contained in _Article III_ and
_Article IV_. Nothing in the Disclosure Schedule is deemed adequate to
disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made in this
Agreement unless the Disclosure Schedule identifies the exception with
particularity and describes the relevant facts in detail. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the mere listing (or inclusion of a copy) of
a document or other item is not deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a
representation or warranty unless the representation or warranty relates
solely to the existence of the document or other item itself. The schedules
in the Disclosure Schedule relate only to the representations and
warranties in the section and subsection of this Agreement to which they
correspond and not to any other representation or warranty in this Agreement.
In the event of any inconsistency between the statements in this Agreement and
statements in the Disclosure Schedule, the statements in this Agreement will
control and the statements in the Disclosure Schedule will be disregarded.

  



  

12.11 _Signatures; Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of
more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute
one and the same instrument. A facsimile signature will be considered an
original signature.

  



  

12.12 _GOVERNING LAW_. This Agreement shall be governed and interpreted
in accordance with the Federal Laws of Mexico.

  



  

12.13 _Jurisdiction_. For everything related to the interpretation and
compliance of this Agreement, the parties expressly submit to the
jurisdiction and competence of the courts located in Mexico City, Mexico,
waiving to any other jurisdiction that may correspond by reason of their
current or future domicile.

  



  

12.14 _Construction_. The parties and their respective counsel have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In
addition, each of the parties acknowledges that it is sophisticated and has
been advised by experienced counsel and, to the extent it deemed necessary,
other advisors in connection with the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties
and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this
Agreement. The parties intend that each representation, warranty and
agreement contained in this Agreement will have independent significance. If
any party has breached any representation, warranty or agreement in any
respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or
agreement relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative
levels of specificity) that the party has not breached will not detract from
or mitigate the fact that the party is in breach of the first representation,
warranty or agreement. Any reference to any Law will be deemed to refer to
all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. The headings preceding the text of articles and sections
included in this Agreement and the headings to the schedules and exhibits are
for convenience only and are not be deemed part of this Agreement or given
effect in interpreting this Agreement. References to sections, articles,
schedules or exhibits are to the sections, articles, schedules and exhibits
contained in, referred to or attached to this Agreement, unless otherwise
specified. The word "including" means "including without limitation." The use
of the masculine, feminine or neuter gender or the singular or plural form of
words will not limit any provisions of this Agreement. A statement that an
item is listed, disclosed or described means that it is correctly listed,
disclosed or described, and a statement that a copy of an item has been
delivered means a true and correct copy of the writing has been delivered.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Buyer, Sellers and the Companies have executed this
Combination and Stock Purchase Agreement as of the date first above written.

2.  _REGISTRATION RIGHTS_.

Company shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed with the
Commission, no later than forty-five (45) days following the date of this
Agreement, a Registration Statement for an offering to be made on a
continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act registering the
resale from time to time by Holders of all of the Registrable Securities held
by Holders (the " _Resale Shelf Registration Statement_ "). The Resale Shelf
Registration Statement shall be on Form F-3 (" _Form F-3_ ") or, if Form F-3
is not then available to the Company, on Form F-1 or such other appropriate
form permitting Registration of such Registrable Securities for resale by
such Holders. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Resale Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective as soon as
possible after filing, but in no event later than sixty (60) days following
the filing deadline (the " _Effectiveness Deadline_ "); provided, that the
Effectiveness Deadline shall be extended to ninety (90) days after the filing
if the Registration Statement is reviewed by, and receives comments from, the
Commission. Once effective, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
keep the Resale Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective and to
be supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to ensure that such
Registration Statement is available or, if not available, to ensure that
another Registration Statement is available, under the Securities Act at all
times until the expiration of the Effectiveness Period. The Registration
Statement filed with the Commission pursuant to this subsection 2.1.1 shall
contain a prospectus in such form as to permit any Holder to sell such
Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or
any successor or similar provision adopted by the Commission then in effect)
at any time beginning on the effective date for such Registration Statement
(subject to lock-up restrictions provided in the Lock-Up Agreements), and
shall provide that such Registrable Securities may be sold pursuant to any
method or combination of methods legally available to, and requested by,
Holders.

  



  

2.1.2 _Notification and Distribution of Materials_. The Company shall notify
the Holders in writing of the effectiveness of the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement as soon as practicable, and in any event within one (1) Business
Day after the Resale Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective, and
shall furnish to them, without charge, such number of copies of the Resale
Shelf Registration Statement (including any amendments, supplements and
exhibits), the Prospectus contained therein (including each preliminary
prospectus and all related amendments and supplements) and any documents
incorporated by reference in the Resale Shelf Registration Statement or such
other documents as the Holders may reasonably request in order to facilitate
the sale of the Registrable Securities in the manner described in the Resale
Shelf Registration Statement.

  



    

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

2.1.3 _Amendments and Supplements_. Subject to the provisions of Section
2.1.1 above, the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the Commission
from time to time such amendments and supplements to the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement and Prospectus used in connection therewith as may be
necessary to keep the Resale Shelf Registration Statement effective and to
comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of all the Registrable Securities during the Effectiveness Period.
If any Resale Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2.1.1 is
filed on Form F-3 and thereafter the Company becomes ineligible to use Form
F-3 for secondary sales, the Company shall promptly notify the Holders of
such ineligibility and use its best efforts to file a shelf registration on
Form F-1 or other appropriate form as promptly as practicable to replace the
shelf registration statement on Form F-3 Shelf and have the such replacement
Resale Shelf Registration Statement declared effective as promptly as
practicable and to cause such replacement Resale Shelf Registration Statement
to remain effective, and to be supplemented and amended to the extent
necessary to ensure that such Resale Shelf Registration Statement is
available or, if not available, that another Resale Shelf
Registration Statement is available, for the resale of all the Registrable
Securities held by the Holders until all such Registrable Securities have
ceased to be Registrable Securities; provided, however, that at any time the
Company once again becomes eligible to use Form F-3, the Company shall cause
such replacement Resale Shelf Registration Statement to be amended, or shall
file a new replacement Resale Shelf Registration Statement, such that the
Resale Shelf Registration Statement is once again on Form F-3.

  



  

2.1.4 Notwithstanding the registration obligations set forth in this Section
2.1, in the event the Commission informs the Company that all of the
Registrable Securities cannot, as a result of the application of Rule 415, be
registered for resale as a secondary offering on a single registration
statement, the Company agrees to promptly (i) inform each of the holders
thereof and use its reasonable best efforts to file amendments to the Resale
Shelf Registration Statement as required by the Commission and/or (ii)
withdraw the Resale Shelf Registration Statement and file a new registration
statement (a " _New Registration Statement_ "), on Form F-3, or if Form F-3 is
not then available to the Company for such registration statement, on such
other form available to register for resale the Registrable Securities as a
secondary offering; provided, however, that prior to filing such amendment or
New Registration Statement, the Company shall be obligated to use its
reasonable best efforts to advocate with the Commission for the registration
of all of the Registrable Securities in accordance with any publicly-
available written or oral guidance, comments, requirements or requests of the
Commission staff (the " _SEC Guidance_ "), including without limitation, the
Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations D.29. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, if any SEC Guidance sets forth a
limitation of the number of Registrable Securities permitted to be registered
on a particular Registration Statement as a secondary offering (and
notwithstanding that the Company used diligent efforts to advocate with the
Commission for the registration of all or a greater number of
Registrable Securities), unless otherwise directed in writing by a holder as
to its Registrable Securities, the number of Registrable Securities to be
registered on such Registration Statement will be reduced on a pro rata basis
based on the total number of Registrable Securities held by the Holders,
subject to a determination by the Commission that certain Holders must be
reduced first based on the number of Registrable Securities held by such
Holders. In the event the Company amends the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement or files a New Registration Statement, as the case may be, under
clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to file with the Commission, as promptly as allowed by Commission or
SEC Guidance provided to the Company or to registrants of securities in
general, one or more registration statements on Form F-3 or such other form
available to register for resale those Registrable Securities that were not
registered for resale on the Resale Shelf Registration Statement, as amended,
or the New Registration Statement.

2.1.5 _Demand Takedown_.

  



  

(a) If the Company shall receive a request from (x) the Holders of
at least [1,000,000] shares of Registrable Securities and (y) unless the
request relates to the sale of all remaining Registrable Securities held by
such holders, the estimated market value of the Registrable Securities is at
least [$10,000,000] (the requesting holder(s) shall be referred to herein as
the " _Requesting Holder_ ") that the Company effect an Underwritten Takedown
of such Registrable Securities, and specifying the intended method of
disposition thereof (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may be an underwritten
Block Trade), then the Company shall promptly give notice of such requested
Underwritten Takedown (each such request shall be referred to herein as a "
_Demand Takedown_ ") within five (5) Business Days after receiving such
Demand Takedown to the other Holders and thereupon shall use its
reasonable best efforts to effect, as expeditiously as possible, the offering
in such Underwritten Takedown of:

  



  

(i) subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 2.2.4, all
Registrable Securities for which the Requesting Holder has requested
such offering under Section 2.1.5(a), and

  



  

(ii) subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 2.2.4, all
other Registrable Securities that any Selling Holders have requested
the Company to offer by request received by the Company within seven (7)
Business Days after such Holders receive the Company's notice of the Demand
Takedown, all to the extent necessary to permit the disposition (in accordance
with the intended methods thereof as aforesaid) of the Registrable Securities
so to be offered.

  



  

(b) Promptly after the expiration of the seven (7) Business Day-
period referred to in Section 2.1.5(a)(ii), the Company will notify
all Selling Holders of the identities of the other Selling Holders and the
number of shares of Registrable Securities requested to be included therein.

  



  

(c) The Company shall only be required to effectuate one
Underwritten Takedown within any six (6) month period.

  



  

(d) The Company shall not be required to effectuate more than two
(2) Underwritten Takedowns, exclusive of any underwritten Block Trades.

  



  

(e) If the managing underwriter in an Underwritten Takedown advises
the Company and the Requesting Holder that, in its view, the number of shares
of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such underwritten
offering exceeds the largest number of shares that can be sold without having
an adverse effect on such offering, including the price at which such shares
can be sold, the shares included in such Underwritten Takedown will be
reduced by the Registrable Securities held by the Selling Holders (applied on
a pro rata basis based on the total number of Registrable Securities held by
such Holders, subject to a determination by the Commission that certain
Holders must be reduced first based on the number of Registrable Securities
held by such Holders).

  



    

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

2.1.6 Registrations effected pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall not be
counted as Demand Registrations effected pursuant to Section 2.2.

  



  

2.2 _Demand Registration_.

  



  

2.2.1 _Request for Registration_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and of the Lock-Up Agreements, at any time and from time to time on
or after the date hereof with respect to the Registrable Securities, the
holders of a majority-in-interest of such Registrable Securities (the "
_Demanding Holder_ ") may make a written demand for Registration under the
Securities Act of all or part of their Registrable Securities (a " _Demand
Registration_ "). Any demand for a Demand Registration shall specify the
number of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold and the intended
method(s) of distribution thereof. The Company will within ten (10) days of
the Company's receipt of the Demand Registration notify all holders of
Registrable Securities of the demand, and each holder of Registrable
Securities who wishes to include all or a portion of such holder's Registrable
Securities in the Demand Registration (each, a " _Demand Requesting Holder_
") shall so notify the Company within ten (10) days after the receipt by the
holder of the notice from the Company. Upon any such request, the Demanding
Holder and the Demand Requesting Holders shall be entitled to have their
Registrable Securities included in the Demand Registration, subject to Section
2.2.4 and the provisos set forth in Section 3.1.1, to be effected by the
Company as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than ninety
(90) days after receipt of such Demand Registration. The Company shall not be
obligated to effect (i) more than an aggregate of three (3) Demand
Registrations in the aggregate; (ii) a Demand Registration within ninety (90)
days of a Demand Takedown or within one hundred eighty (180) days of a prior
Demand Registration; or (iv) a Demand Registration unless the market value of
the Registrable Securities to be registered is at least [$10,000,000].
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. and its
designees may only make a demand on one occasion and only in the five-year
period beginning on the effective date of the registration statement on Form
F-1 filed with the Commission in connection with DD3's initial public
offering.

  



  

2.2.2 _Effective Registration_. A Registration will not count as a Demand
Registration until the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with
respect to such Demand Registration has been declared effective and the
Company has complied with all of its obligations under this Agreement with
respect thereto; provided, however, that if, after such Registration
Statement has been declared effective, the offering of Registrable Securities
pursuant to a Demand Registration is interfered with by any stop order or
injunction of the Commission or any other governmental agency or court, the
Registration Statement with respect to such Demand Registration will be deemed
not to have been declared effective, unless and until, (i) such stop order or
injunction is removed, rescinded or otherwise terminated, and (ii) a
majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders who initiated such Demand
Registration thereafter affirmatively elect to continue the offering and
notify the Company in writing, but in no event later than five (5) days of
such election; provided, further, that the Company shall not be obligated to
file a second Registration Statement until a Registration Statement that
has been filed is counted as a Demand Registration or is terminated.

  



    

 | 8| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

2.2.3 _Underwritten Offering_. If the Demanding Holders who initiate a Demand
Registration so elect and such holders so advise the Company as part of their
written demand for a Demand Registration, the offering of such Registrable
Securities pursuant to such Demand Registration shall be in the form of an
underwritten offering (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may be an
underwritten Block Trade). In such event, the right of any holder to include
its Registrable Securities in such Registration shall be conditioned upon such
holder's participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such
holder's Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent
provided herein. All Demanding Holders proposing to distribute their
securities through such underwriting shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in reasonable and customary form with the Underwriter
or Underwriters selected for such underwriting by a majority-in-interest of
the holders initiating the Demand Registration.

  



  

2.2.4 _Reduction of Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or Underwriters
for a Demand Registration that is to be an underwritten offering, in good
faith, advises the Company, the Demanding Holders and the Demand Requesting
Holders in writing that the dollar amount or number of shares of Registrable
Securities which the Demanding Holders and Demand Requesting Holders (if any)
desire to sell, taken together with all other Ordinary Shares or other
securities which the Company desires to sell and the Ordinary Shares, if any,
as to which Registration has been requested pursuant to written contractual
piggy-back registration rights held by other stockholders of the Company
who desire to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum number of
shares that can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the
proposed offering price, the timing, the distribution method, or the
probability of success of such offering (such maximum dollar amount or
maximum number of shares, as applicable, the " _Maximum Number of Shares_ "),
then the Company shall include in such Registration: (i) the Registrable
Securities as to which Demand Registration has been requested by the
Demanding Holders and Demand Requesting Holders (if any) (pro rata in
accordance with the number of shares that each such Demanding Holder and
Demand Requesting Holders (if any) has requested be included in such
Registration, regardless of the number of shares held by each such Demanding
Holder (such proportion is referred to herein as " _Pro Rata_ ")) that can be
sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; (ii) to the extent that
the Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached under the foregoing clause
(i), the Registrable Securities of holders exercising their rights to Register
their Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 2.3; (iii) to the extent
that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached under the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii), the Ordinary Shares or other securities that the Company
desires to sell that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Shares; (iv) to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been
reached under the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the Ordinary Shares
or other securities registrable pursuant to the terms of the Unit Purchase
Option issued to EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. or its designees in connection with
DD3's initial public offering (the " _Unit Purchase Option_ " and such
registrable securities, the " _Option Securities_ ") as to which Piggy-Back
Registration has been requested by the holders thereof, Pro Rata, that can be
sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares and (v) to the extent
that the Maximum Number of Shares have not been reached under the foregoing
clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), the Ordinary Shares or other securities
for the account of other persons that the Company is obligated to Register
pursuant to written contractual arrangements with such persons and that can be
sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares.

  



    

 | 9| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

2.2.5 _Withdrawal_. A Demanding Holder, a Demand Requesting Holder or a
Requesting Holder may elect to withdraw all or a portion of its Registrable
Securities included in a Demand Registration or an Underwritten Takedown for
any reason or no reason at all by giving written notice to the Company and/or
the Underwriter or Underwriters of their request to withdraw prior to the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with
respect to such Demand Registration. If the majority-in-interest of the
Demanding Holders withdraws from a proposed offering relating to a Demand
Registration, then such Registration shall not count as a Demand Registration
provided for in this Section 2.2.

  



  

2.3 _Piggy-Back Registration_.

  



  

2.3.1 _Piggy-Back Rights_. If at any time on or after the date hereof the
Company proposes to file a Registration Statement under the Securities Act
with respect to an offering of equity securities, or securities or other
obligations exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into,
equity securities, by the Company for its own account or for stockholders of
the Company for their account (or by the Company and by stockholders of the
Company including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 2.2), other than a
Registration Statement (i) filed in connection with any employee stock option
or other benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange offer or offering of securities
solely to the Company's existing stockholders, (iii) for an offering of debt
that is convertible into equity securities of the Company, or (iv) for a
dividend reinvestment plan, then the Company shall (x) give written notice of
such proposed filing to the holders of Registrable Securities as soon as
practicable but in no event less than ten (10) days (or in the case of a
Block Trade, five (5) Business Days) before the anticipated filing date, which
notice shall describe the amount and type of securities to be included in
such offering, the intended method(s) of distribution, and the name of
the proposed managing Underwriter or Underwriters, if any, of the offering,
and (y) offer to the holders of Registrable Securities in such notice the
opportunity to Register the sale of such number of shares of Registrable
Securities as such holders may request in writing within five (5) Business
Days following receipt of such notice (a " _Piggy-Back Registration_ "). The
Company shall, in good faith, cause such Registrable Securities to be included
in such Registration and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed underwritten offering to
permit the Registrable Securities requested to be included in a Piggy-Back
Registration on the same terms and conditions as any similar securities of the
Company and to permit the sale or other disposition of such Registrable
Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof.
All holders of Registrable Securities proposing to distribute their securities
through a Piggy-Back Registration that involves an Underwriter or
Underwriters shall enter into an underwriting agreement in reasonable and
customary form with the Underwriter or Underwriters selected for such Piggy-
Back Registration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, EarlyBirdCapital,
Inc. and its designees may exercise its rights under this section only in the
seven-year period beginning on the effective date of the registration
statement on Form F-1 filed with the Commission in connection with DD3's
initial public offering.

2.3.2 _Reduction of Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or Underwriters
for a Piggy-Back Registration that is to be an underwritten offering advises
the Company and the Holders of Registrable Securities in writing that the
dollar amount or number of Ordinary Shares which the Company desires to sell,
taken together with Ordinary Shares, if any, as to which Registration has been
demanded pursuant to separate written contractual arrangements with persons
or entities other than the Holders of Registrable Securities hereunder, the
Registrable Securities as to which Registration has been requested under this
Section 2.3, and the Ordinary Shares, if any, as to which Registration has
been requested pursuant to the written contractual piggy-back registration
rights of other stockholders of the Company, exceeds the Maximum Number of
Shares, then the Company shall include in any such Registration:

  



  

(a) If the Registration is undertaken for the Company's account: (A)

request to withdraw prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement.
The Company (whether on its own good faith determination or as the result of
a withdrawal by persons making a demand pursuant to written contractual
obligations) may withdraw a Registration Statement at any time prior to the

reasonable best efforts to facilitate such Block Trade. The Holders shall use
reasonable best efforts to work with the Company and the Underwriters
(including by disclosing the maximum number of Registrable Securities
proposed to be the subject of such Block Trade) in order to facilitate
preparation of the Registration Statement, Prospectus and other offering
documentation related to the Block Trade and any related due diligence and
comfort procedures. The Company shall not be obligated to facilitate (a) more
than three (3) underwritten Block Trades, (b) any underwritten Block Trade

Registration Statement for a primary offering of equity securities on behalf
of the Company, (b) solicited bids for a primary offering of

Company may preempt the Demand Registration, Underwritten Takedown or

notice of such intention (the " _Preemption Notice_ ") to the Requesting
Holders within three (3) days after the Company has received the request. The
period of preemption may be up to forty-five (45) days following the date of
the Preemption Notice or such longer period as the Company is subject to a
lock-up in connection with the primary offering. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right
of preemption pursuant to this Section 2.5 more than once during any 12 month
period.

  



  

3.  _REGISTRATION PROCEDURES_.

  



  

3.1 _Filings; Information_. Whenever the Company is required to effect the
Registration of any Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 2, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect the Registration and sale of
such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution thereof as expeditiously as practicable, and in connection with
any such request:

  



  

3.1.1 _Filing Registration Statement_. The Company shall, as expeditiously as
practicable and in any event within forty-five (45) days after receipt of a
request for a Demand Registration pursuant to Section 2.1, prepare and file
with the Commission a Registration Statement on Form F-3, if then available
to the Company for such Registration, or if Form F-3 is not then available to
the Company for such Registration, then on any other form for which the
Company then qualifies and which counsel for the Company shall deem
appropriate and which form shall be available for the sale of all Registrable
Securities to be Registered thereunder in accordance with the
intended method(s) of distribution thereof, and shall use its best efforts to
cause such Registration Statement to become and remain effective for the
period required by Section 3.1.3; provided, however, that the Company shall
have the right to defer any Demand Registration for up to sixty (60) days,
and any Piggy-Back Registration for such period as may be applicable to
deferment of any Demand Registration to which such Piggy-Back Registration
relates, in each case if the Company shall furnish to the holders a
certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or President of
the Company stating that Adverse Disclosure would be required to be set forth
in such Registration Statement; provided, further, however, that the Company
shall not have the right to exercise the right set forth in the immediately
preceding proviso more than once and more than a total of ninety (90) days in
any 365-day period in respect of Demand Registrations hereunder.

  



    

 | 13| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

3.1.2 _Copies; Participation_. The Company shall, at least five (5) Business
Days prior to filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any amendment
or supplement thereto, furnish without charge to the holders of Registrable
Securities included in such Registration, and such holders' legal
counsel, copies of such Registration Statement as proposed to be filed, each
amendment and supplement to such Registration Statement (in each case
including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by reference
therein), the Prospectus included in such Registration Statement (including
each preliminary prospectus), and such other documents as the holders of
Registrable Securities included in such Registration or legal counsel for any
such holders may request in order to facilitate the disposition of the
Registrable Securities owned by such holders. The Company shall permit a
representative of any Holder of Registrable Securities included in such
Registration and any attorney or accountant retained by such Holder to
participate, at such Holder's sole cost and expense, in the preparation of
any Registration Statement, each Prospectus included therein or filed with the
Commission, and each amendment or supplement thereto, and will give each such
person or entity access to its books and records and such opportunities to
discuss the business, finances and accounts of the Company with the Company's
officers, directors and independent public accountants who have certified the
Company's financial statements as shall be necessary, in the opinion of such
Holders' respective counsel, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the
meaning of the Securities Act. The Company shall not file any Registration
Statement or Prospectus, or amendment or supplement thereto, to which a
Holder of Registrable Securities included in such Registration shall have
reasonably objected on the grounds that any portion(s) of such Registration
Statement or Prospectus or supplement or amendment thereto does not comply in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act
or the rules and regulations thereunder.

  



  

3.1.3 _Amendments and Supplements_. The Company shall prepare and file with
the Commission such amendments, including post-effective amendments, and
supplements to such Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in
connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such Registration
Statement effective and in compliance with the provisions of the Securities
Act until all Registrable Securities and other securities covered by such
Registration Statement have been disposed of in accordance with the intended
method(s) of distribution set forth in such Registration Statement or such
securities have been withdrawn (the " _Effectiveness Period_ ").

  



  

3.1.4 _Notification_. After the filing of a Registration Statement, the
Company shall promptly, and in no event more than two (2) Business Days after
such filing, notify the holders of Registrable Securities included in such
Registration Statement of such filing, and shall further notify such holders
promptly and confirm such advice in writing in all events within two (2)
Business Days of the occurrence of any of the following: (i) when such
Registration Statement becomes effective; (ii) when any post-effective
amendment to such Registration Statement becomes effective; (iii) the
issuance or threatened issuance by the Commission of any stop order (and the
Company shall take all actions required to prevent the entry of such stop
order or to remove it if entered); and (iv) any request by the Commission for
any amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement or any Prospectus
relating thereto or for additional information or of the occurrence of an
event requiring the preparation of a supplement or amendment to such
prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the
securities covered by such Registration Statement, such prospectus will not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, and promptly make available to the holders of
Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement any such
supplement or amendment; except that before filing with the Commission a
Registration Statement or prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto,
[excluding] documents incorporated by reference, the Company shall furnish to
the holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement
and to the legal counsel for any such holders, copies of all such documents
proposed to be filed sufficiently in advance of filing to provide such holders
and legal counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review such documents and
comment thereon, and the Company shall not file any Registration Statement or
prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto, [excluding] documents
incorporated by reference, to which such holders or their legal counsel shall
reasonably object.

3.1.5 _Securities Laws Compliance_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) register or qualify the Registrable Securities covered by the
Registration Statement under such securities or "blue sky" laws of such
jurisdictions in the United States as the holders of Registrable Securities
included in such Registration Statement (in light of their intended plan of
distribution) may request and to keep such registration or qualification in
effect for so long as such Registration Statement remains in effect and (ii)
take such action necessary to cause such Registrable Securities covered by
the Registration Statement to be Registered with or approved by such other
governmental authorities or securities exchanges, including the Nasdaq Capital
Market, as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of the
Company and do any and all other acts and things that may be necessary or
advisable to enable the holders of Registrable Securities included in such
Registration Statement to consummate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities in such jurisdictions; provided, however, that the Company shall
not be required to qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where
it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this paragraph or
subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction.

  



  

3.1.6 _Agreements for Disposition_. The Company shall enter into customary
agreements (including, if applicable, an underwriting agreement in reasonable
and customary form) and take such other actions as are reasonably required in
order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities. The representations, warranties and covenants of the
Company in any underwriting agreement which are made to or for the benefit of
any Underwriters, to the extent applicable, shall also be made to and for the
benefit of the holders of Registrable Securities included in such
Registration Statement, and the representations, warranties and covenants of
the holders of Registrable Securities included in such registration statement
in any underwriting agreement which are made to or for the benefit of any

3.1.7 _Cooperation_. The principal executive officer of the Company, the
principal financial officer of the Company, the principal accounting officer
of the Company and all other officers and members of the management of the
Company shall cooperate fully in any offering of Registrable Securities
hereunder, which cooperation shall include, without limitation, the
preparation of the Registration Statement with respect to such offering and
all other offering materials and related documents, and participation as
reasonably requested in meetings with Underwriters, attorneys, accountants
and potential investors.

  



  

3.1.8 _Selection of Underwriters_. In connection with any Registration
effected by or at the direction of Holders pursuant to this Agreement, the
Selling Holders holding a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities
requested to be sold in any Registration shall have the right to select
an Underwriter or Underwriters in connection with such Registration, which
Underwriter or Underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. In
connection with a Registration pursuant to this Agreement, the Company shall
enter into customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement in
reasonable and customary form) and take such other actions as are reasonably
required in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the
Registrable Securities in such Registration, including, if necessary,
the engagement of a "qualified independent underwriter" in connection with
the qualification of the underwriting arrangements with the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.

  



    

 | 15| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

3.1.9 _Records_. The Company shall make available for inspection by the
holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement, any
Underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such Registration
Statement and any attorney, accountant or other professional retained by any
holder of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement or
any Underwriter, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate
documents and properties of the Company, as shall be necessary to enable them
to exercise their due diligence responsibility, and cause the Company's
officers, directors and employees to supply all information reasonably
requested by any of them in connection with such Registration Statement.

  



  

3.1.10 _Opinions and Comfort Letters_. The Company shall furnish to each
holder of Registrable Securities included in any Registration Statement a
signed counterpart, addressed to such holder, of (i) any opinion of counsel
to the Company delivered to any Underwriter and (ii) any comfort letter from
the Company's independent public accountants delivered to any Underwriter
(provided that such holder provides any representation letter or other
undertaking reasonably required by the independent public accountant). In the
event no legal opinion is delivered to any Underwriter, the Company shall
furnish to each holder of Registrable Securities included in such
Registration Statement, at any time that such holder elects to use a
prospectus, an opinion of counsel to the Company to the effect that
the Registration Statement containing such prospectus has been declared
effective and that no stop order is in effect.

  



  

3.1.11 _Earnings Statement_. The Company shall comply with all applicable
rules and regulations of the Commission and the Securities Act, and make
available to its stockholders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings
statement covering a period of twelve (12) months, beginning within three (3)
months after the effective date of the Registration Statement, which earnings
statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act
and Rule 158 thereunder.

  



  

3.1.12 _Listing_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
all Registrable Securities included in any Registration to be listed on such
exchanges or otherwise designated for trading in the same manner as similar
securities issued by the Company are then listed or designated.

  



  

3.1.13 _Transfer Agent_. The Company shall provide a transfer agent or

state a material fact required to be stated in a Registration Statement or
Prospectus, or necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made not misleading (a " _Misstatement_
"), and then to correct such Misstatement.

  



    

 | 16|

Registration Statement becomes effective, including, without limitation: (i)

Securities as required by Section 3.1.12; (vi) Financial Industry Regulatory

connection with such Registration; and (ix) the reasonable fees and expenses
of one legal counsel selected by the holders of a majority-in-interest of the
Registrable Securities included in such Registration. The Company shall have
no obligation to pay any underwriting discounts or selling commissions
attributable to the Registrable Securities being sold by the holders thereof,
which underwriting discounts or selling commissions shall be borne by such
holders. Additionally, in an underwritten offering, all selling stockholders
and the Company shall bear the expenses of the underwriter pro rata in
proportion to the respective amount of shares each is selling in such
offering.

  



  

3.3 _Information_. The holders of Registrable Securities shall use reasonable
best efforts to provide such information as may reasonably be requested by the
Company, or the managing Underwriter, if any, in connection with the
preparation of any Registration Statement, including amendments and
supplements thereto, in order to effect the Registration of any Registrable
Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to Section 2 and in connection
with the Company's obligation to comply with federal and applicable state
securities laws. It is a condition to the inclusion of a Holder's Registrable
Securities in any Registration Statement or any Underwritten Takedown or
other underwritten offering pursuant to this Agreement that such Holder has
timely provided any requested information.

  



  

3.4 _Requirements for Participation in Underwritten Offerings_. No person may
participate in any underwritten offering for equity securities of the Company
pursuant to a Registration initiated by the Company hereunder unless such
person (i) agrees to sell such person's securities on the basis provided in

executes all customary questionnaires, indemnities, lock-up agreements,
underwriting agreements and other customary documents as may be reasonably
required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

  



    

 | 17| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

3.5 _Suspension of Sales; Adverse Disclosure_. Upon receipt of written notice
from the Company that a Registration Statement or prospectus contains a
Misstatement or of the happening of any event of the kind described in
Section 3.1.4(iv), each of the Holders shall forthwith discontinue disposition
of Registrable Securities until it has received copies of a supplemented or
amended prospectus correcting the Misstatement (it being understood that the
Company hereby covenants to prepare and file such supplement or amendment as
soon as practicable after the time of such notice), or until it is advised in
writing by the Company that the use of the prospectus may be resumed. If the
filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of a Registration Statement in
respect of any Registration at any time would require the Company to make an
Adverse Disclosure (as defined below) or would require the inclusion in such
Registration Statement of financial statements that are unavailable to the
Company for reasons beyond the Company's control, the Company may, upon giving
prompt written notice of such action to the Holders, delay the filing or
initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of, such Registration Statement for
the shortest period of time, but in no event more than thirty (30) days,
determined in good faith by the Company to be necessary for such purpose. In
the event the Company exercises its rights under the preceding sentence, the
Holders agree to suspend, as promptly as practicable after their receipt of
the notice referred to above, their use of the Prospectus relating to any
Registration in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable
Securities. The Company shall immediately notify the Holders of the
expiration of any period during which it exercised its rights under this
Section 3.5. " _Adverse Disclosure_ " shall mean any public disclosure of
material non-public information, which disclosure, in the good faith judgment
of the board of directors of the Company, after consultation with counsel to
the Company, (i) would be required to be made in any Registration
Statement or Prospectus in order for the applicable Registration Statement or
Prospectus not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein (in
the case of any prospectus and any preliminary prospectus, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, (ii) would not
be required to be made at such time if the Registration Statement were not
being filed, and (iii) the Company has a bona fide business purpose for not
making such information public.

  



  

3.6 _Other Covenants and Obligations_. As long as any Holder shall own
Registrable Securities: (a) the Company will not file any Registration
Statement or Prospectus included therein or any other filing or document with
the Commission which refers to any Holder of Registrable Securities as
a selling securityholder by name without the prior written approval of such
disclosure by such Holder; (b) the Company, at all times while it shall be
reporting under the Exchange Act, covenants to use reasonable best efforts to
file timely (or obtain extensions in respect thereof and file within the
applicable grace period) all reports required to be filed by the Company after
the date hereof pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; (c)
the Company further covenants that it shall take such further action as any
holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to
enable such Holder to sell Ordinary Shares held by such Holder without
Registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions
provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, including
providing any legal opinions; and (d) upon the request of any Holder, the
Company shall deliver to such Holder a written certification of a duly
authorized officer as to whether it has complied with the requirements set
forth in the foregoing clauses (b) and, solely as to actions specifically
requested by the holder, (c).

4.  _INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION_.

  



  

4.1 _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless each Holder of Registrable Securities, and each of their
respective officers, employees, affiliates, directors, partners, members,
equityholders, attorneys, advisors and agents, and each person or entity, if
any, who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or
Section 20 of the Exchange Act) each Holder of Registrable Securities (each,
a " _Holder Indemnified Party_ "), from and against any expenses, losses,
judgments, actions, claims, proceedings (whether commenced or threatened),
damages or liabilities, whether joint or several (collectively, " _Losses_
"), arising out of or based upon any Misstatement contained in any
Registration Statement under which the sale of such Registrable Securities
was Registered under the Securities Act, any preliminary Prospectus,
final Prospectus or summary Prospectus contained in such Registration
Statement, or any amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement,
preliminary Prospectus, final Prospectus or summary Prospectus, or any
violation by the Company of the Securities Act or any rule or regulation
promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company and relating to action or
inaction required of the Company in connection with any such Registration;
and the Company shall promptly reimburse the Holder Indemnified Party for any
legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred by such Holder Indemnified
Party in connection with investigating and defending any such Losses, except,
with respect to any Holder of Registrable Securities, to the extent such
Holder of Registrable Securities is liable to indemnify the Company for such
Losses pursuant to Section 4.2. The Company also shall indemnify any
Underwriter of the Registrable Securities, their officers, affiliates,
directors, partners, members and agents and each person who controls such
Underwriter on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification
provided above in this Section 4.1.

  



  

4.2 _Indemnification by Holders of Registrable Securities_. Each Selling
Holder of Registrable Securities will, in the event that any Registration is
being effected under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement of any
Registrable Securities held by such Selling Holder and the Company has
required all Selling Holders to provide such an undertaking on the same
terms, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and
officers and each underwriter (if any), and each other Selling Holder and each
other person, if any, who controls another Selling Holder or such underwriter
within the meaning of the Securities Act, against any Losses, insofar as such
Losses arise out of or are based upon any Misstatement contained in any
Registration Statement under which the sale of such Registrable Securities
was Registered under the Securities Act, any preliminary Prospectus, final
Prospectus or summary Prospectus contained in the Registration Statement, or
any amendment or supplement thereto, if the Misstatement was made in reliance
upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company
by such Selling Holder expressly for use therein, and shall reimburse the
Company, its directors and officers, and each other Selling Holder for any
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any of them in connection
with investigation or defending any such Loss. Each Selling Holder's
indemnification obligations hereunder shall be several and not joint and
shall be proportional to and limited to the amount of any net proceeds
actually received by such Selling Holder in connection with the sale of
Registrable Securities under a Registration Statement from which such Losses
arise. Each Selling Holder of Registrable Securities shall indemnify any
Underwriter of the Registrable Securities, their officers, affiliates,
directors, partners, members and agents and each person who controls such
Underwriter to the same extent as provided in the foregoing with respect to
indemnification of the Company.

  



    

 | 19| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

4.3 _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. Promptly after receipt by any
person of any notice of any Loss in respect of which indemnity may be sought
pursuant to Section 4.1 or 4.2, such person (the " _Indemnified Party_ ")
shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any other person
for indemnification hereunder, notify such other person (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") in writing of the Loss; provided, however, that the failure by the
Indemnified Party to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party from any liability which the Indemnifying Party may
have to such Indemnified Party hereunder, except and solely to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. If the
Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification with respect to any claim or
action brought against the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to participate in such claim or action, and, to the extent
that it wishes, jointly with all other Indemnifying Parties, to assume control
of the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Party.
After notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its
election to assume control of the defense of such claim or action, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal
or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection
with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation;
provided, however, that in any action in which both the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party are named as defendants, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to employ separate counsel (but no more than one such separate
counsel, in addition to local counsel) to represent the Indemnified Party and
its controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any
claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Indemnified
Party against the Indemnifying Party, with the fees and expenses of such
counsel to be paid by such Indemnifying Party if, based upon the written
opinion of counsel of such Indemnified Party, representation of both parties
by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between them. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to entry of judgment
or effect any settlement of any claim or pending or threatened proceeding in
respect of any Losses for which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification
hereunder if such settlement or judgment includes any non-monetary remedies,
requires an admission of fault or culpability on the part of the Indemnified
Party or does not include an unconditional release from all liability of the
Indemnified Party in respect of such Losses.

  



  

4.4 _Contribution_.

  



  

4.4.1 If the indemnification provided for in the foregoing Sections 4.1, 4.2
and 4.3 is unavailable to any Indemnified Party in respect of any Loss
referred to herein, then each such Indemnifying Party, in lieu of
indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Loss in such proportion
as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnified Parties
and the Indemnifying Parties in connection with the actions or omissions which
resulted in such Loss. The relative fault of any Indemnified Party and any
Indemnifying Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether the Misstatement relates to information supplied by such Indemnified
Party or such Indemnifying Party (in the case of a Holder, such
Misstatement was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information
furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for use therein)
and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such Misstatement.

  



    

 | 20| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

4.4.2 The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 4.4 were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account
of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
Section 4.4.1. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result
of any Loss referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be
deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or
other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Section 4.4, no Holder of Registrable Securities shall be
required to contribute any amount in excess of the dollar amount of the net
proceeds (after payment of any underwriting fees, discounts, commissions or
taxes) actually received by such Holder from the sale of
Registrable Securities which gave rise to such contribution obligation. No
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

  



  

4.5 _Survival_. The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the Indemnified Party or any officer, director or controlling
person of such Indemnified Party and shall survive the transfer
of securities.

  



  

5.  _[Intentionally omitted]_

  



  

6.  _MISCELLANEOUS_.

  



  

6.1 _Other Registration Rights_. The Company represents and warrants that no
person, other than a holder of the Registrable Securities, has any right to
require the Company to Register any shares of the Company's capital stock for
sale or to include shares of the Company's capital stock in any Registration
filed by the Company for the sale of shares of capital stock for its own
account or for the account of any other person. Further, the Company shall
not hereafter enter into any agreement with respect to its securities which is
inconsistent with or violates the rights granted to the Holders of
Registrable Securities and the Company represents and warrants that
this Agreement supersedes any other registration rights agreement or
agreement with similar terms and conditions and in the event of a conflict
between any such agreement or agreements and this Agreement, the terms of this
Agreement shall prevail.

  



  

6.2 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
rights, duties and obligations of the Company hereunder may not be assigned or
delegated by the Company in whole or in part. This Agreement and the rights,
duties and obligations of the Holders of Registrable Securities hereunder
only be transferred or assigned to Permitted Transferees of a Holder of
Registrable Securities. This Agreement and the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of each of the parties and the
Permitted Assigns of the applicable holder of Registrable Securities or of
any assignee of the applicable holder of Registrable Securities. This
Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or benefits on any persons
that are not party hereto other than as expressly set forth in Article 4
and this Section 6.2. No assignment by any party hereto of such party's
rights, duties and obligations hereunder shall be binding upon or obligate
the Company unless and until the Company shall have received (i) written
notice of such assignment and (ii) the written agreement of the assignee, in
a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to be bound by the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (which may be accomplished by an addendum or
certificate of joinder to this Agreement).

communications (collectively, " _Notices_ ") required or permitted to be
given hereunder or which are given with respect to this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be personally served, delivered by reputable air courier
service with charges prepaid, or transmitted by hand delivery, e-mail,
telegram, telex or facsimile, addressed as set forth below, or to such other
address as such party shall have specified most recently by written notice.
Notice shall be deemed given on the date of service or transmission if
personally served or transmitted by telegram, telex or facsimile;
provided, that if such service or transmission is not on a Business Day or is
after normal business hours, then such notice shall be deemed given on the
next Business Day. Notice otherwise sent as provided herein shall be deemed

6.4 _Severability_. This Agreement shall be deemed severable, and the
invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision hereof shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or of any other term
or provision hereof. Furthermore, in lieu of any such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, the parties hereto intend that there shall
be added as a part of this Agreement a provision as similar in terms to such
invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible that is valid and
enforceable.

  



  

6.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same instrument.

and thereto) constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and

limitation the Prior Agreement.

  



  

6.7 _Modifications and Amendments_. Upon the written consent of the Company
and the Holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the
Registrable Securities at the time in question, compliance with any of the
provisions, covenants and conditions set forth in this Agreement may be
waived, or any of such provisions, covenants or conditions may be amended or
modified; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, any
amendment hereto or waiver hereof that adversely affects one holder of
Registrable Securities, solely in its capacity as a holder of the Ordinary
Shares of the Company, in a manner that is materially different from the other
Holders of Registrable Securities (in such capacity) shall require the
consent of the Holder so affected. No course of dealing between any holders
of Registrable Securities or the Company and any other party hereto or any
failure or delay on the part of a holder of Registrable Securities or the
Company in exercising any rights or remedies under this Agreement shall
operate as a waiver of any rights or remedies of any holder of Registrable
Securities or the Company. No single or partial exercise of any rights or
remedies under this Agreement by a party shall operate as a waiver or
preclude the exercise of any other rights or remedies hereunder or thereunder
by such party.

  



    

 | 23| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

6.8 _Titles and Headings_. Titles and headings of sections of this Agreement
are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction of any
provision of this Agreement.

  



  

6.9 _Waivers and Extensions_. Any party to this Agreement may waive any
right, breach or default which such party has the right to waive, provided
that such waiver will not be effective against the waiving party unless it is
in writing, is signed by such party, and specifically refers to this
Agreement. Waivers may be made in advance or after the right waived has
arisen or the breach or default waived has occurred. Any waiver may be
conditional. No waiver of any breach of any agreement or provision herein
contained shall be deemed a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach
thereof nor of any other agreement or provision herein contained. No waiver or
extension of time for performance of any obligations or acts shall be deemed
a waiver or extension of the time for performance of any other obligations or
acts.

  



  

6.10 _Remedies Cumulative_. In the event that the Company fails to observe or
perform any covenant or agreement to be observed or performed under this
Agreement, the applicable holder of Registrable Securities may proceed to
protect and enforce its rights by suit in equity or action at law, whether
for specific performance of any term contained in this Agreement or for an
injunction against the breach of any such term or in aid of the exercise of
any power granted in this Agreement or to enforce any other legal or equitable
right, or to take any one or more of such actions, without being required to
post a bond. None of the rights, powers or remedies conferred under
this Agreement shall be mutually exclusive, and each such right, power or
remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any other right, power or
remedy, whether conferred by this Agreement or now or hereafter available at
law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.

  



  

6.11 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, interpreted under,
and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York
applicable to agreements made and to be performed within the State of New
York, without giving effect to any choice-of-law provisions thereof that
would compel the application of the substantive laws of any other
jurisdiction.

  



  

6.12 _Waiver of Trial by Jury_. Each party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives the right to a trial by jury in any action, suit,
counterclaim or other proceeding (whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise) arising out of, connected with or relating to this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby, or the actions of the Holders in the
negotiation, administration, performance or enforcement hereof.

__________, 2019

  



  

Betterware de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. 
 [Address]

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

I have been advised that as of the date of this letter I may be deemed to be
an "affiliate" of Betterware de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., a Mexican _sociedad an
onima de capital variable_ (" _BWM_ "), and/or BLSM Latino America
Servicios, S.A. de C.V., a Mexican _sociedad an onima de capital variable_ ("
_BLSM_ ," and together with BWM, the " _Companies_ "), as the term
"affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of
the rules and regulations (the " _Rules and Regulations_ ") of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _Act_ "). Reference is made to that certain Combination and
Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of [_____], 2019 (the " _BCA_ "), by and
among DD3 Acquisition Corp., a British Virgin Islands company, as buyer ("
_Buyer_ "), Campalier, S.A. de C.V., a Mexican  _sociedad an onima de capital
variable_ (" _Campalier_ "), Promotora Forteza, S.A. de C.V., a Mexican 
_sociedad an onima de capital variable_ (" _Forteza_ "), and Strevo, S.A. de
C.V., a Mexican _sociedad an onima de capital variable _(" _Strevo_ ", and
together with Campalier and Forteza, " _Sellers_ "), the Companies, and DD3
Mex Acquisition Corp., S.A. de C.V., solely for the purposes set forth in
_Article IX_ thereof. Capitalized terms used in this letter agreement
without definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the BCA.

  



  

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the BCA, Buyer will be merged
with and into BWM (the " _Merger_ "), with BWM surviving the Merger and BLSM
will continue its existence as a majority-owned subsidiary of BWM. As a result
of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Buyer shall cease and
BWM shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger.

  



  

As a result of the Merger, I may receive ordinary shares, no par value, of
BWM (the " _BWM Shares_ "). I would receive such BWM Shares in exchange for
ordinary shares of [the Companies] owned by me.

  



  

1. I represent, warrant and covenant to Buyer that in the event I receive any BWM Shares as a result of the Merger:

  



  

A. I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the BWM
Shares in violation of the Securities Act or the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder.

  



  

B. I have carefully read this letter and the BCA and discussed the
requirements of such documents and other applicable limitations upon my
ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the BWM Shares, to the
extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel for the Company.

  



    



 



    



  

C. I have been advised that the issuance of the BWM Shares to me
pursuant to the Merger has been registered with the SEC under the Act on a
Registration Statement on Form F-4. However, I have also been advised that,
because at the time the Merger is submitted for a vote of the shareholders of
the Buyer, (a) I may be deemed to be an affiliate of one or both of the
Companies and (b) the distribution by me of the BWM Shares has not been
registered under the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the
BWM Shares issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other
disposition is made in conformity with Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under
the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered
under the Act or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to
Buyer, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from
registration under the Act.

  



  

D. I understand that there will be placed on the certificates for the
BWM Shares issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in
substance:

  



  

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION
TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE
SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY ONLY BE TRANSFERRED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF AN AFFILIATE LETTER AGREEMENT DATED ____, 2019
AND A LOCK-UP LETTER AGREEMENT DATED ____, 2019, EACH BETWEEN THE REGISTERED
HOLDER HEREOF AND BETTERWARE DE MEXICO, S.A. DE C.V. COPIES OF SUCH
AGREEMENTS ARE ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF BETTERWARE DE MEXICO, S.A.
DE C.V."

  



  

E. I understand that unless a sale or transfer is made in conformity
with the provisions of Rule 145, or pursuant to a registration statement, BWM
reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to
my transferee:

  



  

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON
WHO RECEIVED SUCH SECURITIES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SECURITIES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED
BY THE HOLDER NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY
DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY
NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN
EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR
PURSUANT TO A VALID REGISTRATION STATEMENT.

  



  

F. Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on my
part that I am an "affiliate" of the Company as described in the first
paragraph of this letter, nor as a waiver of any rights I may have to object
to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

  



  

2. By BWM's acceptance of this letter, BWM hereby agrees with me as follows:

  



    

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

A. For so long as and to the extent necessary to permit me to sell the
BWM Shares pursuant to Rule 145 and, to the extent applicable, Rule 144 under
the Act, BWM shall (a) use its reasonable efforts to (i) file all reports and
data required to be filed with the SEC by it pursuant to Section 13 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "),
and (ii) furnish to me upon request a written statement as to whether BWM has
complied with such reporting requirements during the 12 months preceding any
proposed sale of the BWM Shares by me under Rule 145, and (b) otherwise use
its reasonable efforts to permit such sales pursuant to Rule 145 and Rule
144. BWM hereby represents to me that it has filed all reports required to be
filed with the SEC under Section 13 of the Exchange Act since becoming
subject to the reporting obligations of the Exchange Act.

  



  

B. It is understood and agreed that certificates with the legends set
forth in paragraphs 1(E) and l(F) above will be substituted by delivery of
certificates without such legends if (i) BWM has complied with the provisions
of Rule 145(d)(1), and (ii) (a) one year shall have elapsed from the date the
undersigned acquired the BWM Shares received in the Merger and the provisions
of Rule 145(d)(iii) are then applicable to the undersigned, or (b) BWM has
received either an opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel shall
be reasonably satisfactory to BWM, or a "no action" letter obtained by the
undersigned from the staff of the SEC, to the effect that the restrictions
imposed by Rule 145 under the Act no longer apply to the undersigned.

Clausula y en los articulos  158, 159 y 160 de la Ley General de Sociedades
Mercantiles, la Sociedad debera indemnizar por todos los gastos, incluyendo 
honorarios legales, sentencias, multas y cantidades pagadas por transaccion y
los razonablemente incurridos en relacion  con cualquier procedimiento legal,
administrativo o de investigacion a cualquier persona que: 
  



    



 



    



  

     (a) is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
Proceeding by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director,
officer, key employee or adviser of the Company of the Company; or  |   |
(a) sea o haya sido parte o hay amenaza de que sea considerada como una
parte de cualquier Procedimiento por el hecho de que dicha persona es o fue un
consejero, funcionario, empleado clave o asesor de la Sociedad; o 
---|---|--- 
     |   | 
   (b) is or was, at the request of the Company, serving as a director of,
or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another Enterprise.  |   |
(b) sea o haya fungido, a solicitud de la Sociedad, como director de, o en

     |   | 
   The indemnity in this Chapter only applies if the relevant indemnitee
acted honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the
Company and, in the case of criminal proceedings, the person had no reasonable
cause to believe that their conduct was unlawful.  |   | La indemnizacion
del presente Capitulo solo sera aplicable si la persona a indemnizar actuo
honestamente y de buena fe en aras a los mejores intereses de la Sociedad y,
en caso de algun proceso criminal, no exista duda razonable para creer que la
conducta de dicha persona fue ilicita. 
     |   | 
   The decision of the Sole Manager or Board of Directors, as the case may
be, as to whether an indemnitee acted honestly and in good faith and with a
view to the best interests of the Company and as to whether such indemnitee
had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful is, in the
absence of fraud, sufficient for the purposes of the Articles, unless a

una cuestion legal. 
     |   | 
   The termination of any proceeding by any judgment, order, settlement,
conviction or the entering of a _nolle prosequi_ does not, by itself, create
a presumption that the person did not act honestly and in good faith and with
a view to the best interests of the Company or that such indemnitee had
reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.  |   | La
terminacion de cualquier procedimiento por una sentencia, orden, transaccion,
condena o el sobreseimiento, por si mismo, no crea una presuncion de que la
persona no actuo honestamente y de buena fe y en aras a los mejores intereses
de la Sociedad o que exista duda razonable para creer que la conducta de dicha
persona fue ilicita. 
     |   | 
   Expenses, including legal fees, incurred by an Indemnitee in defending
any Proceeding may be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition
of such proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the
Indemnitee to repay the amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the
indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company in accordance with
this Chapter and upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Company deems
appropriate.  |   | Los gastos, incluyendo honorarios legales, en los que
incurra una persona a indemnizar en la defensa de cualquier procedimiento
seran pagados por la Sociedad, previo a la ultima actuacion de dicho
procedimiento, una vez que reciba el compromiso de o a nombre de la persona a
indemnizar de pagar el monto que ultimadamente se determine que la persona a
indemnizar no tiene derecho a recibir por la Sociedad de conformidad con este
Capitulo y conforme a los terminos y condiciones que, en su caso, la Sociedad
considere convenientes. 
     |   | 
   The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this section is not exclusive of any other rights to which an
indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled
under any agreement, Resolution of Members, resolution of disinterested
directors or otherwise, both as to acting in the indemnitee's official
capacity in relation to the Company and as to acting in any other capacity
while serving in the indemnitee's official capacity in relation to the
Company.  |   |  

La indemnizacion y el anticipo de  gastos de, u otorgada conforme a, esta
seccion no sera exclusiva de cualesquiera otros derechos respecto a
solicitar  indemnizacion o anticipo de gastos que una persona a indemnizar
tenga conforme a cualquier contrato, Resolucion de  Consejeros, resolucion de
consejeros sin interes o de cualquier otra manera, tanto en su caracter de
funcionario  en relacion con la Sociedad como en cualquier otro caracter
mientras sirva como funcionario en relacion con  la Sociedad.

 


 
     |   | 
   If an indemnitee has been successful in defense of any proceeding
referred to in this Chapter, the indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified
against all expenses, including legal fees, and against all judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement and reasonably incurred by that indemnitee in
connection with the proceeding.  |   | Si una persona a indemnizar ha
tenido exito en la defensa de cualquier procedimiento a que hace referencia
este Capitulo, la persona a indemnizar tendra derecho a ser indemnizado de

cantidades pagadas por transaccion y los razonablemente incurridos por dicha

     The Company may purchase and maintain insurance or furnish similar
protection or make other arrangements including, but not limited to, providing
a trust fund, letter of credit or surety bond in relation to any indemnitee or
who at the request of the Company is or was serving as a director, officer or
liquidator of, or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another
enterprise, against any liability asserted against the person and incurred by
him in that capacity, whether or not the Company has or would have had the
power to indemnify him against the liability as provided in these bylaws.  |
  | La Sociedad podra contratar y mantener seguros u otorgar proteccion
similar o realizar otros acuerdos incluyendo, pero no limitado a,
fideicomisos, cartas de credito o fianzas de seguridad en relacion con
cualquier persona a indemnizar que, a solicitud de la Sociedad, se encuentre o
haya servido como consejero, funcionario, liquidador, o en cualquier otro
caracter se encuentre o haya actuado para otro negocio, respecto a cualquier
responsabilidad que le sea imputada y que haya incurrido en dicho caracter,
sin importar si la Sociedad tenga o no el poder de indemnizar dicha
responsabilidad de conformidad con los presentes estatutos.

3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the undersigned may sell or otherwise transfer Lock-Up Shares during the undersigned's lifetime or on death (or, if the undersigned is not a natural person, during its existence):
