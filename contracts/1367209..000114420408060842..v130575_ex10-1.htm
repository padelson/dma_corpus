AGREEMENT  AND PLAN OF MERGER, CONVERSION AND SHARE EXCHANGE, dated as of
November 3,  2008  (this " ** _Agreement_** "),  by  and among PANTHEON
CHINA ACQUISITION CORP., a corporation incorporated in the  State of
Delaware, USA (" ** _Pantheon_** "),  PANTHEON ARIZONA CORP., a corporation
incorporated in the State of Arizona,  USA  and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Pantheon (" ** _Pantheon  Arizona_** "),  CHINA  CORD BLOOD SERVICES
CORPORATION, an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman  Islands (
**the  "** ** _Target_** "),  GOLDEN MEDITECH COMPANY LIMITED, an exempted
company incorporated in the Cayman  Islands (" ** _GM_** "),  and  the
selling shareholders of the Target named in Schedule I hereto (each a " **
_Selling_** **_Shareholder_** " and  collectively the " ** _Selling_**
**_Shareholders_** ").  Each  of the Parties to this Agreement is
individually referred to herein as a " ** _Party_** " and  collectively as
the " ** _Parties_**."  Capitalized terms used herein that are not otherwise
defined herein shall have  the meanings ascribed to them in Annex A hereto.

 

 

**_BACKGROUND_**

 

 

Pantheon  has formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Pantheon Arizona, solely for
the purposes  of (1) the merger of Pantheon with and into Pantheon Arizona
pursuant to Section  253 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " ** _DGCL_** "),  in  which Pantheon Arizona will be the
surviving corporation (the " ** _Merger "_**),  (2)  the subsequent
conversion of Pantheon Arizona into a Cayman Islands company  by a  transfer
of domicile pursuant to Section 10-226 of the Arizona Revised Statutes  (the
" ** _ARS_** "),  (3)  the registration and continuation of Pantheon Arizona
as a Cayman Islands  company pursuant to Section 221 of the Cayman Companies
Law (the " ** _Conversion_** ")  and  (4) the Share Exchange (as defined
below). The Cayman Islands company will  be  named China Cord Blood Services
Holdings Corporation or such other name as  approved by the Target (" **
_Pantheon  Cayman_** ," and  together with Pantheon and Pantheon Arizona,
the " ** _Pantheon  Parties_** "). 

 

 

The  boards of directors of each of Pantheon and Pantheon Arizona have
declared  this  Agreement advisable and approved the Transactions, and each
of the boards of  directors of Pantheon and Pantheon Arizona has adopted
resolutions approving  the  Merger and providing that (i) each share of
Common Stock outstanding immediately  prior to the Merger Effective Time (as
defined below) (" ** _Pantheon  Shares_** ")  will  be automatically
converted at the Merger Effective Time into one share of common  stock, par
value US$0.001 per share, of Pantheon Arizona (" ** _Pantheon  Arizona
Shares_** ");  and  (ii) all Warrants, Underwriters Purchase Option and
other rights to purchase  a  Pantheon Share (" ** _Pantheon  Stock
Rights_** ," and  together with Pantheon Shares, " ** _Pantheon 
Securities_** ")  will  be exchanged at the Merger Effective Time for
substantially equivalent  securities of Pantheon Arizona (" ** _Pantheon 
Arizona Stock Rights_** ," and  together with Pantheon Arizona Shares, " **
_Pantheon  Arizona Securities_** ").

 

 

The  board  of directors of Pantheon Arizona has approved the Conversion,
upon the terms  and  subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
whereby upon the  Conversion Effective Time (as defined below), each
outstanding Pantheon Arizona  Share will be automatically converted into one
ordinary share, par value  US$0.001 per share, of Pantheon Cayman (" **
_Pantheon  Cayman Shares_** ")  and  each Pantheon Arizona Stock Right will
be automatically converted into  equivalent securities of Pantheon Cayman ("
** _Pantheon  Cayman Stock Rights_** ," and  together with Pantheon Cayman
Shares, " ** _Pantheon  Cayman Securities_** ").


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  Selling Shareholders are the direct owners of the number of ordinary
shares  of  the Target appearing opposite their names on Schedule I hereto
(all such shares  of capital stock to be exchanged under this Agreement are
referred to as the  " ** _Target  Shares_** ").

 

 

The  board  of directors of Pantheon Arizona has approved the acquisition of
the Target  Shares from the Selling Shareholders through a share exchange
transaction (the  " ** _Share  Exchange_** "),  pursuant to which Pantheon
Cayman will issue to each of the Selling Shareholders  a number of Pantheon
Cayman Shares in exchange for the Target Shares held by  such Selling
Shareholder, calculated based on an issue price of US$6.05 per  Pantheon
Cayman Share, an implied valuation of US$350.0 million for the Target,  and
such Selling Shareholder's equity interest in the Target. Subject to the 
Target's future performance, Pantheon Cayman will issue to senior management
up  to an aggregate of 9,000,000 Earn-Out Warrants (as defined below).

 

 

The  Merger and the Conversion require the affirmative vote of the holders of
a  majority of the issued and outstanding shares of the Common Stock, and
the  Share  Exchange requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the  shares of Common Stock sold in the Pantheon Public Offering
voted at the  meeting, _provided_ ,  that  the Share Exchange will only
proceed if holders of less than 20% of the shares  of the Common Stock sold
in the Pantheon Public Offering exercise their  conversion rights (it being
understood that such stockholders or shareholders,  as applicable, will be
the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding  Pantheon Arizona
Shares that are entitled to vote immediately prior to the  Conversion and the
holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding Pantheon  Cayman Shares
that are entitled to vote immediately prior to the Share Exchange,  since the
Merger, Conversion and Share Exchange shall happen as close to 
simultaneously as permitted by the applicable laws).

 

 

The  Merger, the Conversion and the Share Exchange are part of the same
integrated  transaction, such that none of the Merger, the Conversion or the
Share Exchange  shall occur without the other.

 

 

**_AGREEMENT_**

 

 

NOW,  THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective

without interruption, in the organizational form of a Cayman Islands 
exempted company rather than an Arizona corporation. The Conversion shall
have  the effects specified in the relevant sections of the ARS and the
Cayman  Companies Law. The Conversion and the Share Exchange are part of the
same  integrated transaction, such that neither the Conversion nor the Share
Exchange  shall occur without the other.

documents required to evidence and effect such  transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been  paid.

 

 

Section  4.4 _Effect  of the Conversion_.  At the  Conversion Effective

Shares, Pantheon Cayman shall sell, issue and deliver  to each Selling
Shareholder the number of Pantheon Cayman Shares (the " ** _Initial  Equity
Payment_** ")  appearing opposite the name of such Selling Shareholder on

to the Amendment, each option to purchase one ordinary share of CSC  shall
become an option to purchase 35.73314 Pantheon Cayman Shares (the " **
_Option  Exchange Rate_** ")  at an  exercise price per Pantheon Cayman
Share equal to the greater of (a) the  quotient of (i) the exercise price of
the CSC Employee Option for which it  is  exchanged divided by (ii) the

the Pantheon Cayman Shares to be received by them pursuant to Section 5.1, 
to  the holders of CSC Employee Options (and their successors and permitted
assigns)  in respect of the Pantheon Cayman Shares underlying the options

successors  and  permitted assigns) in respect of the Pantheon Cayman Shares
underlying the  Earn-Out Warrants (if any) to be issued to them pursuant to
Section 5.4,  provided that the Selling Shareholders (and their successors

Share on the date of the issuance of such  warrant and having an expiration
date on the fifth anniversary of the issuance  date thereof (the " ** _Earn-
Out  Warrants_** ")  to the  senior management. The number of Earn-Out
Warrants to be awarded, if any, to  individual senior management members
shall be determined on a case-by-case  basis  by the compensation committee
of Pantheon Cayman (or a majority of independent  directors or another
committee of the board performing similar functions) at  the  time the Earn-
Out Warrants are issued. The Earn-Out Warrants shall be issuable  without the
payment of any additional consideration in the amounts and under  the 
circumstance described below:

Shares, without first providing Pantheon Cayman  with an opinion of counsel
(which counsel and opinion are reasonably  satisfactory to Pantheon Cayman)
to the effect that such transfer will be exempt  from the registration and
the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities  Act and the
registration or qualification requirements of any applicable U.S.  state
securities laws.

 

 

Section  7.12 _Lock-Up_.  Such  Selling Shareholder irrevocably agrees with
Pantheon that, during the six months  following **** the  Closing Date (such
period, the " ** _Restriction  Period_** "),  except with the written
consent of Pantheon Cayman, it shall not offer, sell,  contract to sell,
pledge or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any transaction  which is
designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the  disposition

cash settlement or otherwise), directly or indirectly, including the filing 
(or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the SEC in 
respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate 
or  decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of

transfer instructions preventing  its  transfer agent from effecting any
actions in violation of this Agreement through  the end of the Restriction
Period. Such Selling Shareholder acknowledges that  the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement is a material  inducement to Pantheon to
complete the Transactions and that Pantheon and the  Target shall be entitled

under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or  acceleration
of any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or result  in the

to any Warrantor, in connection with the  execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement or the consummation of  the  Transactions, except for (a)
such Consents as may be required under applicable  state securities laws and
the securities laws of any foreign country; and (b)  such other Consents

the ordinary course of business and not required under generally  accepted
accounting principles to be reflected in the Target Financial  Statements,

reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the  Target.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The  Target does not have any Off-balance Sheet Arrangements except
arrangements  that  do not and would not reasonably be expected to,

Target.

Statements (the  " ** _Target  Balance Sheet_** ")  reflects any
outstanding loans to or from any stockholders of the Target, all  such loans
have been repaid or forgiven, as applicable, and are no longer  outstanding
as of the date hereof.

recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial  statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and  to  maintain
asset accountability, (c) access to assets is permitted only in  accordance
with management's general or specific authorization, and (d) the  recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at  reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any  differences.

of  its Subsidiaries is in default under any of such Material Permits and no
event  has occurred and no condition exists which, with the giving of notice
or the  passage of time, or both, would constitute a default thereunder.
Neither the  execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Transaction
Documents or any  of  the other documents contemplated hereby or thereby nor
the consummation of  the  Transactions or compliance by the Target and its
Subsidiaries with any of the  provisions hereof or thereof will result in any
suspension, revocation,  impairment, forfeiture or nonrenewal of any Material
Permit applicable to the  business of the Target and its Subsidiaries.

the SEC since December 14, 2006, pursuant  to Sections 13(a), 14(a) and 15(d)
of the Exchange Act (the " ** _Pantheon  SEC Documents_** ").  As of  its
respective filing date, each Pantheon SEC Document complied in all material 
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations  of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Pantheon
SEC Document,  and  did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a  material fact required to be stated therein or necessary

later filed Pantheon SEC  Document, none of the Pantheon SEC Documents
contains any untrue statement  of a  material fact or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated therein  or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the  circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The consolidated  financial statements of Pantheon
included in the Pantheon SEC Documents (the  " ** _Pantheon  Financial
Statements_** ")  comply  as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements  and  the published rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto, have been  prepared in accordance with U.S.
GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited  statements, as permitted by the rules
and regulations of the SEC) applied on  a  consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in  the  notes thereto) and
fairly present the consolidated financial position of  Pantheon as of the
dates thereof and the consolidated results of their  operations and cash
flows as at the respective dates of and for the periods  referred to in such
financial statements (subject, in the case of unaudited  financial
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and the omission  of  notes
to the extent permitted by Regulation S-X of the SEC).

 

 

Section  9.8 _Internal  Accounting Controls_.  Pantheon maintains a system
of internal accounting controls sufficient to  provide reasonable assurance
that (a) transactions are executed in accordance  with management's general
or specific authorizations, (b) transactions are  recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in  conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles and to maintain asset  accountability, (c)
access to assets is permitted only in accordance with  management's general
or specific authorization, and (d) the recorded  accountability for assets is
compared with the existing assets at reasonable  intervals and appropriate
action is taken with respect to any differences.  Pantheon's officers have
established disclosure controls and procedures for  Pantheon and designed
such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that  material information
relating to Pantheon is made known to the officers by  others within those
entities. Pantheon's officers have evaluated the  effectiveness of Pantheon's
controls and procedures and there is no material  weakness, significant
deficiency or control deficiency, in each case as such  term is defined in
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Std.  No.  2. Since March
31, 2008, there have been no significant changes in Pantheon's  internal
controls or, to Pantheon's Knowledge, in other factors that could 
significantly affect Pantheon's internal controls.

is  not  in violation of or in default under (nor does there exist any
condition which  upon the passage of time, the giving of notice or both would
cause such a  violation of or default under) any Pantheon Material Contract
to which it is  a  party or by which it or any of its properties or assets
is bound, except for  violations or defaults that would not, individually or

or in the aggregate, have  not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect  on Pantheon. There are no unpaid Taxes
claimed to be due by any Governmental  Authority in charge of taxation of any
jurisdiction, nor any claim for  additional Taxes for any period for which
Tax Returns have been filed, except  to  the extent that any failure to pay,

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect  on  Pantheon, and the officers
of Pantheon know of no basis for any such  claim.

 

 

(b) Pantheon  has not received any notice that any Governmental Authority
will audit or  examine (except for any general audits or examinations
routinely performed  by  such Governmental Authorities), seek information
with respect to, or make  material claims or assessments with respect to any
Taxes for any period.  Pantheon has made available to the Target copies of
all Tax Returns, examination  reports, and statements of deficiencies filed
by, assessed against or agreed  to  by Pantheon for and during fiscal years
2006 and 2007 (since  inception).

periods and portions  thereof through the date of such financial statements.
Pantheon is neither  a  party to nor is it bound by any tax indemnity, tax
sharing or similar agreement  and Pantheon currently has no material
liability and will not have any material  liabilities for any Taxes of any

and hold harmless Pantheon (which term, for the purposes of this Article  XV
shall include any of Pantheon's successors) and permitted assigns (the " **
_Pantheon  Indemnified Parties_** ")  from  and against any liabilities,
loss, claims, damages, fines, penalties, expenses  (including costs of
investigation and defense and reasonable attorneys' fees and  court costs)
(collectively, " ** _Damages_** ")  arising from: (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty made by the  Warrantors in Article VIII hereof or
in any certificate delivered by the  Warrantors pursuant to this Agreement;
or (ii) any breach by any Warrantor  of  its covenants or obligations in
this Agreement to be performed or complied  with  by such Warrantor at or
prior to the Closing.

 

 

Section  15.3 _Indemnification  by the Selling Shareholders_.  The 
Selling Shareholders shall, subject to the terms hereof, severally but not 
jointly, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Pantheon Indemnified
Parties  from and against any Damages arising from: (i) any breach of any
representation  or warranty made by the Selling Shareholders in Article VII
hereof or in any  certificate delivered by the Selling Shareholders pursuant
to this Agreement;  and (ii) any breach by any Selling Shareholder of its
covenants or obligations  in this Agreement to be performed or complied with

provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the  Pantheon Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant  to Section 15.2,
unless and until the aggregate amount of Damages to the  Pantheon Indemnified
Parties with respect to such matters under Section 15.2  or  15.3
collectively exceeds US$5,000,000 (the " ** _Deductible_** ").  The 
aggregate amount of Damages of the Warrantors under this Agreement shall not

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  15.6 _Defense  of Third Party Claims_.  If any  Pantheon
Indemnified Party or Shareholder Indemnified Party determines to make  a 
claim for indemnification under Section 15.2, 15.3 or 15.4 (each an " **
_Indemnitee_** "),  Pantheon or GM, as applicable, shall notify the
indemnifying party (an " ** _Indemnitor_** ")  of the  claim in writing
promptly after receiving notice of any action, lawsuit,  proceeding,
investigation, demand or other claim against the Indemnitee (if  by a  third
party), describing the claim, the amount thereof (if known and  quantifiable)
and the basis thereof in reasonable detail (such written notice,  an " **
_Indemnification  Notice_** ");  provided that the failure to so notify an
Indemnitor shall not relieve the  Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent that (and only  to  the extent that) such failure shall
have caused the damages for which the  Indemnitor is obligated to be greater
than such damages would have been had  the  Indemnitee given the Indemnitor
prompt notice hereunder. Any Indemnitor shall  be  entitled to participate
in the defense of such action, lawsuit, proceeding,  investigation or other
claim giving rise to an Indemnitee's claim for  indemnification at such
Indemnitor's expense, and at its option shall be  entitled to assume the
defense thereof by appointing a reputable counsel  reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnitee to be the lead counsel in connection  with such defense;
_provided_ ,  that  the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such claim  and  to employ counsel of its choice for such
purpose; _provided,  however_ ,  that  the fees and expenses of such
separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitee  and shall not be
recoverable from such Indemnitor under this Article XV. If  the  Indemnitor
shall control the defense of any such claim, the Indemnitor shall  be 
entitled to settle such claims; _provided_ ,  that  the Indemnitor shall
obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which  consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before  entering into any
settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim if,  pursuant to or as
a result of such settlement or cessation, injunctive or other  equitable
relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee or if such settlement  does not
expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnitee from all  liabilities
and obligations with respect to such claim. If the Indemnitor  assumes such
defense, the Indemnitor shall not be liable for any amount required  to be
paid by the Indemnitee that exceeds, where the Indemnitee has unreasonably 
withheld or delayed consent in connection with the proposed compromise or 
settlement of a third party claim, the amount for which that third party
claim  could have been settled pursuant to that proposed compromise or
settlement.  In  all cases, the Indemnitee shall provide its reasonable
cooperation with the  Indemnitor in defense of claims or litigation,
including by making employees,  information and documentation reasonably
available. If the Indemnitor shall  not  assume the defense of any such
action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or  other claim, the Indemnitee
may defend against such matter as it deems  appropriate; provided that the
Indemnitee may not settle any such matter without  the written consent of the
Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld, conditioned or
delayed) if the Indemnitee is seeking or will seek  indemnification hereunder
with respect to such matter.

 

 

Section  15.7 _Determining  Damages_.  The  amount of Damages subject to
indemnification under Section 15.2 shall be  calculated net of (i) any Tax
Benefit inuring to the Indemnitee on account  of  such Damages, (ii) any
reserves set forth in any of the Target Financial  Statements or the Target
Interim Financial Statements relating to such Damages  and (iii) any
insurance proceeds or other amounts under indemnification  agreements
received or receivable by the Indemnitee on account of such Damages.  If the
Indemnitee receives a Tax Benefit on account of such Damages after an 
indemnification payment is made to it, the Indemnitee shall promptly pay to 
the  Person or Persons that made such indemnification payment the amount of
such  Tax  Benefit at such time or times as and to the extent that such Tax
Benefit is  realized by the Indemnitee. For purposes hereof, " ** _Tax 
Benefit_** " shall  mean any refund of Taxes to be paid or reduction in the
amount of Taxes which  otherwise would be paid by the Indemnitee, in each
case computed at the highest  marginal tax rates applicable to the recipient
of such benefit. To the extent  Damages are recoverable by insurance, the
Indemnitees shall take all  commercially reasonable efforts to obtain maximum
recovery from such insurance.  In the event that an insurance or other
recovery is made by any Indemnitee  with  respect to Damages for which any
such Person has been indemnified hereunder,  then a refund equal to the
aggregate amount of the recovery shall be made  promptly to the Person or
Persons that provided such indemnity payments to  such  Indemnitee. The
Indemnitors shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitees  in respect
of Damages indemnified by the Indemnitors. The Indemnitees shall  take  all
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all Damages upon and after 
becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise 
to  Damages. For Tax purposes, the Parties agree to treat all payments made
under  this Article XV as adjustments to the consideration received for the
Target  Shares.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  15.8 _Right  of Setoff_.  To the  extent that any Party is
obligated to indemnify any other Party after Closing  under the provisions of
this Article XV for Damages reduced to a monetary  amount, such Party after
Closing shall have the right to decrease any amount  due  and owing or to be
due and owing under any agreement with the other Party,  whether under this
Agreement or any other agreement between such Parties on  the  one hand, and
any of the other Party or any of their respective Affiliates,  Subsidiaries
or controlled persons or entities on the other.

 

 

Section  15.9 _Limitation  on Recourse; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 

 

(a) No  claim  shall be brought or maintained by any Party or its respective
successors or  permitted assigns against any officer, director, partner,
member, agent,  representative, Affiliate, equity holder, successor or
permitted assign of  any  Party which is not otherwise expressly identified
as a Party, and no recourse  shall be brought or granted against any of them,
by virtue of or based upon  any  alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in
or breach of any of the  representations, warranties, covenants or
obligations of any Party set forth  or  contained in this Agreement or any
exhibit or schedule hereto or any certificate  delivered hereunder.

 

 

(b) The  provisions of this Article XV are for the sole benefit of the
Parties and  nothing in this Article XV, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer  upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit
or remedy of any  nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Article XV.

written  instrument signed by all of the Parties hereto. No waiver of any
default with  respect to any provision, condition or requirement of this
