iv    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated
as of January 17, 2001 (this "AGREEMENT"), by and among ARISTOCRAT LEISURE
LIMITED, an Australian company ("PARENT"), CEDAR ACQUISITION CORP., a Nevada
corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("ACQUISITION"), and CASINO DATA SYSTEMS, a Nevada corporation (the
"COMPANY").    BACKGROUND   A. The respective Boards of Directors of
Parent, Acquisition and the Company have approved, and deem it fair to and in
the best interests of their respective shareholders and stockholders to
consummate, the merger of Acquisition with and into the Company (the
"MERGER"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and in accordance with the Nevada Revised Statutes ("NRS"), whereby
each issued and outstanding share of common stock of the Company, no par
value per share (the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK"), other than shares to be
cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(c), will be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined below).   B. This Agreement
and the Merger are required to be approved by the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock (the "STOCKHOLDER
APPROVAL").    C. As a condition and inducement to Parent and Acquisition
entering into this Agreement and incurring the obligations set forth herein,
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent and
certain stockholders of the Company ("PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS") are
simultaneously entering into a Voting Agreement (the "VOTING AGREEMENT")
pursuant to which, among other things, such stockholders have agreed to vote
certain of the shares of Company Common Stock owned by such stockholders
(aggregating approximately 9.5% of the outstanding capital stock of the
Company) in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger.   D.
Parent, Acquisition and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also
to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.    AGREEMENT   In
consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree as
follows:     ARTICLE I  THE MERGER   SECTION 1.1 THE MERGER. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in
accordance with Chapter 92A of the NRS, Acquisition shall be merged with and
into the Company at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3). As a
result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Acquisition shall
cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the
"SURVIVING CORPORATION").   SECTION 1.2 CLOSING. The closing of the Merger
will take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by the parties, which
shall be no later than the second business day after satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article VI (the "CLOSING DATE"), at the
offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 300 South Grand Avenue,
Los Angeles, California 90071, unless another time, date or place is agreed
to in writing by the parties hereto.   SECTION 1.3 EFFECTIVE TIME. Subject
to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing

as is specified in such filings (the date and time of such effectiveness,
being the "EFFECTIVE TIME").   SECTION 1.4 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. The Merger
shall have the effects set forth in Section 92A.250 of the NRS and all other
effects specified in the applicable provisions of the NRS.   SECTION 1.5

the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be the same as the name of the
Company), until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable law.   SECTION 1.6 DIRECTORS. At the Effective Time, except as
set forth on EXHIBIT 1.6, each of the directors of the Company and its
subsidiaries shall resign or be removed from the Board of Directors of the
Company and its subsidiaries, respectively. The directors of Acquisition
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified at the
Effective Time, as the case may be.   SECTION 1.7 OFFICERS. Except as set
forth on EXHIBIT 1.7, the officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation at the
Effective Time and shall hold office until the earlier of their death,
resignation or removal or until their successors are duly appointed and
qualified.   2    SECTION 1.8 ADDITIONAL ACTIONS. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised
that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions
or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or
under any of the rights, properties or assets of Acquisition or the Company
or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of Acquisition or the Company, all such deeds, bills of sale,
assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of
Acquisition or the Company, all such other actions and things as may be
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title
and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.    ARTICLE
II  EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE  CONSTITUENT
CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   SECTION 2.1 EFFECT ON CAPITAL
STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Parent, Acquisition, the Company or the holders of any shares
of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Acquisition:  
(a) CONVERSION OF COMMON STOCK.   (i) At the Effective Time, each share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock owned by the
Company or any subsidiary of the Company, or Parent, Acquisition or any other
subsidiary of Parent (the "EXCLUDED SHARES") shall, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into
the right to receive, without interest, $ 9.25 in cash (the "MERGER
CONSIDERATION").   (ii) As of the Effective Time, all shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate
previously representing any such shares shall thereafter represent the right
to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificates in
accordance with Section 2.2. The holders of such certificates previously
evidencing such shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
shares of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time except as otherwise
provided herein or by law.   (b) CAPITAL STOCK OF ACQUISITION. Each share of
the capital stock of Acquisition issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (c) CANCELLATION OF
TREASURY STOCK AND PARENT OWNED STOCK. Each share of Company Common Stock
that is owned by the Company or by any subsidiary of the Company and each
share of Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent, Acquisition or any
other subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist without any
conversion thereof and no consideration shall be delivered with respect
thereto.   3    SECTION 2.2 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.   (a) Promptly
after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent (as defined below) shall mail to
each holder of record of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal (the
"COMPANY LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL") (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company certificates representing
shares of the Company Common Stock (the "CERTIFICATES") shall pass, only upon
delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form
and have such other provisions as Parent shall reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented thereby.   (b) Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause to be deposited with the party specified by Parent
as the exchange agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") amounts sufficient in the
aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Exchange Agent to make
payments pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i) hereof to holders of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time who are
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. Any interest, dividends, or
other income earned on the investment of cash deposited by Parent with the
Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section 2.2(b) shall be for the
account of and payable to Parent.   (c) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent
of Certificates, together with the Company Letter of Transmittal, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and only
upon such surrender, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive, in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
promptly cause to be delivered to such holder a check in an amount equal to
the Merger Consideration payable for each such share of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate, after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings or transfer taxes or other similar taxes. The Certificates
surrendered pursuant to this Section 2.2(c) shall forthwith be cancelled. If
any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed, then upon
receipt of an affidavit of that fact from the holder claiming such
Certificate to be lost, mislaid, stolen or destroyed and a lost certificate
indemnity (in each case reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Exchange
Agent), the Exchange Agent shall issue to such holder the
Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such lost, stolen,
mislaid or destroyed Certificate shall have been converted, after giving
effect to any required tax withholdings or transfer taxes or other similar
taxes.   (d) No interest will be paid or will accrue on the amount payable
upon the surrender of any Certificate. If payment is to be made to a person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, it shall be
a condition of such payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer, as determined
by the Exchange Agent or Parent, and that the person requesting such payment
shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a
person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
establish to the satisfaction of the Parent or the Exchange Agent that such
tax has been paid or is not payable. One hundred eighty (180) days  
4   following the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to cause the
Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) made available to the Exchange Agent which have not
been disbursed to holders of certificates formerly representing shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding on the Effective Time, and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look to the Parent only as general creditors
thereof with respect to cash payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates.   (e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
Merger Consideration may be paid or issued to a person other than the person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer, shall be properly endorsed with signature guarantees or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable.   (f) The Merger Consideration
paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the
terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid and issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore represented by such Certificates. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
further registrations of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock
thereafter on the records of the Company.   SECTION 2.3 STOCK OPTIONS. (a)
At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock (a "COMPANY STOCK OPTION" or, collectively, the "COMPANY STOCK
OPTIONS") issued pursuant to the Company\'s 1993 Stock Option and
Compensation Plan and the Company\'s 1994 Non-Employee Director Stock Option
Plan or otherwise (collectively, the "STOCK OPTION PLANS"), whether vested or
unvested, shall be canceled and each holder of a Company Stock Option shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the
product of (a) the difference between the Merger Consideration and the
exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (b) the
number of shares subject to such Company Stock Option, less any applicable
Taxes withheld by the Company under applicable law.   (b) In connection with
such cancellation, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain
any required consents from holders of Company Stock Options as required
pursuant to the Stock Option Plans. The Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to take all other actions necessary and appropriate so that all stock
option and other equity-based plans maintained with respect to the Company
Common Stock, including, without limitation, the Stock Option Plans, shall
terminate as of the Effective Time, and the provisions of any other Employee
Plan (as defined in Section 3.11(a) hereof) providing for the issuance,
transfer or grant of any capital stock of the Company or any interest in
respect of any capital stock of the Company shall be deleted as of the
Effective Time, and the Company shall ensure that following the
Effective Time no holder of a Company Stock Option or any participant in any
Stock Option Plan shall have any rights thereunder to acquire any capital
stock of the Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation.   5   
SECTION 2.4 NO LIABILITY. None of Parent, Acquisition, the Company or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any cash otherwise payable to such holder of shares of
Company Common Stock or paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   ARTICLE III  REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Except as publicly disclosed by the Company
in the Company SEC Reports filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof and
except as set forth on the Disclosure Schedule (it being agreed that
disclosure of any item in such schedule shall be deemed disclosure with
respect to any section of this Agreement) previously delivered by the Company
to Parent (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE"), the Company hereby represents
and warrants to each of Parent and Acquisition as follows:   SECTION 3.1
ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION; SUBSIDIARIES.   (a) Section 3.1(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and accurate list of each
subsidiary of the Company as of the date hereof and its respective
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, as the case may be. Each of
the Company and its subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its businesses as now being
conducted. The Company has heretofore delivered to Parent accurate and
complete copies of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws (or similar
governing documents), as currently in effect, of the Company and
its subsidiaries.   (b) The respective articles of incorporation and bylaws
or other organizational documents of the subsidiaries of the Company do not
contain any provision limiting or otherwise restricting the ability of the
Company to control such subsidiaries, other than as required by Gaming Laws.
The Company does not directly or indirectly beneficially own any securities
or other beneficial ownership interests in any other entity (including
through joint ventures or partnership arrangements) other than (i) the
subsidiaries of the Company identified on Schedule 3.1(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or (ii) as otherwise disclosed on Schedule 3.1(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.   (c) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries
is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not be reasonably expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The term "COMPANY MATERIAL ADVERSE
EFFECT" means any change or effect that, individually or in the aggregate, is
or is reasonably likely to be materially adverse to the business, assets,
operations, results of operations, prospects (as identified in the Company\'s
2001 Preliminary Budget dated January 6, 2001 ("BUDGET")) or financial
condition of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as whole, other than any
changes or effects arising out of (i) conditions generally affecting
industries in which the Company operates,(ii) the entering into or the
public   6   announcement or disclosure of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) general economic conditions, or (iv)
the financial markets.   SECTION 3.2 CAPITALIZATION OF THE COMPANY AND
ITS SUBSIDIARIES.   (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 100 million shares of capital stock, of which, as of January 16,
2001, 18,558,065 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding,
and no shares of Company Common Stock were held in the Company\'s treasury.
All of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock have been validly
issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. As of
January 17, 2001, 1,724,856 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for
issuance pursuant to outstanding Company Stock Options. Except as set forth
in this Section 3.2, as of January 17, 2001, there were outstanding (i) no
shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the Company, (ii) no
stock appreciation rights, phantom stock units, restricted stock grants,
contingent stock grants or Employee Plans which grant awards of any of the
foregoing, and no other outstanding contractual rights to which the Company
is a party the value of which is based on the value of Company Common Stock,
(iii) no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company or any
subsidiary having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable
for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which
stockholders of the Company may vote, (iv) no securities of the Company or
its subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock
or voting securities of the Company, (v) no options or other rights to
acquire from the Company or its subsidiaries and, no obligations of the
Company or its subsidiaries to issue any capital stock, voting securities or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock or voting
securities of the Company and (iv) no equity equivalent interests in the
ownership or earnings of the Company or its subsidiaries (collectively
"COMPANY SECURITIES"). Section 3.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists
each outstanding Company Stock Option, showing in each case the exercise
price, the number of shares of Company Common Stock into which each such
Company Stock Option is exercisable, and the expiration date of such Company
Stock Option. As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding obligations of
the Company or its subsidiaries to repurchase redeem or otherwise acquire any
Company Securities. There are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or
other agreements or understandings to which the Company is a party or by
which it is bound relating to the voting or registration of any shares
of capital stock of the Company. To the knowledge of the Company, as of the
date of this Agreement, there are no irrevocable proxies and no voting
agreements (other than the Voting Agreement) with respect to any shares of

arrangement, or any adverse right or interest, charge or claim of any nature
whatsoever of, on, or with respect to, any asset, property or property

Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary, in order
to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they

by the Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein based on information supplied by Parent or Acquisition for inclusion

ENTITY") or other person is necessary for the execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement or the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby, except where the failure to obtain such
permits, authorizations, consents or approvals or to make such filings or
give such notice would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent or
significantly delay consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby will (a) conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of the
respective Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws (or similar governing
documents) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (b) result in a

provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license,  
9   contract, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any
of their respective properties or assets may be bound and which contemplates
a payment to or from the Company in any twelve month period of an amount in
excess of $100,000 or (c) except as set forth in Section 3.6 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, to the Company\'s knowledge, violate any order, writ,
injunction, decree, law, statute, rule or regulation applicable to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets except, in the case of (b) or (c), for violations, breaches or
defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The term "GAMING
AUTHORITY" means all foreign, federal, state, local or supranational
governmental, regulatory or licensing authorities or the National Indian
Gaming Commission, or other aboriginal or tribal authority, which issues or

necessary or appropriate for the lawful operation of gaming and
related businesses and operations engaged in by the Company or its
subsidiaries. The term "LICENSE" means a license, registration, finding of
suitability, permit, order, consent or other regulatory approval necessary
for the lawful operation or conduct of gaming, manufacturing, distributing
and related business or businesses (including specific contractual relations)
engaged in by the Company or any subsidiary in any jurisdiction issued or
given by a Gaming Authority or Governmental Entity.   SECTION 3.7 NO
DEFAULT. None of the Company or its subsidiaries is in breach, default or
violation (and no event has occurred which with notice or the lapse of time
or both would constitute a breach default or violation) of any term,
condition or provision of (a) its Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws (or
similar governing documents), (b) any Company Material Contract or Company
Permit (as hereinafter defined) or (c) any order, writ, injunction, decree,
law, statute, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets except, in the case of (b) or (c), for violations, breaches or

expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent or
significantly delay consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.  
SECTION 3.8 ABSENCE OF CHANGES. Since September 30, 2000, there have been no
events, changes or effects with respect to the Company or its subsidiaries
that would have a Company Material Adverse Effect or that are outside the

on Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no suit, claim,
action, proceeding or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the

Intellectual Property Rights, and, to the Company\'s knowledge, whether or
not in writing, with respect to Intellectual Property Rights) against the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets before any Governmental Entity or arbitrator which would be reasonably
expected to result in costs, losses, fines, penalties, settlements (payable
in royalties or otherwise), awards, or other financial damages to the
Company, if determined adversely, in an amount of $100,000 or more, result in
an injunction preventing the company from offering any current or presently
contemplated products or services, or affect the validity, enforceability or
ownership of any Company Intellectual Property Rights or would reasonably be
expected to prevent or significantly delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of the Company or its
subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order, writ,   10   injunction
or decree of any Governmental Entity that would have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or would reasonably be expected to prevent or significantly
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   SECTION
3.10 COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW.   (a) Except where the failure to hold
the same, or the invalidity or revocation thereof, would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, the Company and its subsidiaries hold all permits,
Licenses, variances, exemptions and approvals from all Governmental Entities
necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses as presently
conducted, (the "COMPANY PERMITS") all of which are valid and in full force
and effect, subject to any conditions or limitations imposed by any such
authority, and no notice of revocation or suspension has been received or, to
the knowledge of the Company, is pending or threatened in writing in respect
thereof and no event has occurred which permits, or upon the giving of notice
or passage of time or both would permit, revocation, non-renewal,
modification, suspension, limitation or termination of any Company Permit
that currently is in effect. The Company and its subsidiaries are in
compliance with the terms of the Company Permits except where the failure so
to comply would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent or significantly delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   (b) The
businesses of the Company and its subsidiaries are not being conducted in
violation of any law, ordinance or regulation of any Governmental Entity,
except that no representation or warranty is made in this Section 3.10 with
respect to Environmental Laws (as defined in Section 3.12 below) and except
for violations or possible violations which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
and PROVIDED HOWEVER that certain such Company Permits as are listed in
Section 3.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule are in the process of
being renewed. To the knowledge of the Company and its subsidiaries, no
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to
the Company or its subsidiaries is pending or threatened, nor to the
knowledge of the Company and its subsidiaries, has any Governmental Entity
indicated an intention to conduct the same, other than such investigations or
reviews as would not be reasonably expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   (c) The Company and its subsidiaries are currently
operating in substantial compliance with the terms of all Company Permits
issued by Gaming Authorities, and to the extent there has not been such
compliance in the past all such non-compliances have been rectified. No
Gaming Authority is restricting or prohibiting the continuation of the
business of the Company or any of the Company\'s subsidiaries as presently
conducted through any order, decree or otherwise. Except as disclosed in
Section 3.10(c) of the Company\'s Disclosure Schedule, (i) neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries, nor any director, officer, key employee,
person performing management functions similar to officers or, to the
Company\'s knowledge, partners of the Company or any of its subsidiaries has
received any written claim, demand notice, complaint, court order or
administrative order from any Governmental Entity in the past three years
under or relating to any violation or possible violation of any Gaming Laws
(as defined below) which did or would be reasonably likely to result in fines
or penalties of $50,000 or more; (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, there
are no facts which, if known to the   11   Gaming Authorities under the
Gaming Laws, could reasonably be expected to result in the revocation,
limitation or suspension of a Company Permit, or any officer, director, key
employee, other person performing management functions similar to an officer
or partner, under any Gaming Laws and neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has any reason to believe that any Gaming Authority
is considering, or has any basis for, restricting or prohibiting the
continuation of the business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as
presently conducted through any order, decree or otherwise, and (iii) neither
the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has suffered a suspension or
revocation of any Company Permit held under or pursuant to the Gaming Laws.
The term "Gaming Laws" means any law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation,
License, judgment, order, decree, injunction or other authorization of a
Governmental Entity, including any condition or limitation placed thereon,
governing or relating to the current or contemplated casino, gaming and
related manufacturing and distributing activities and operations of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries.   SECTION 3.11 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS;
LABOR MATTERS.   (a) Section 3.11(a) contains a true and complete list of
each deferred compensation and each incentive compensation, stock purchase,
stock option and other equity compensation plan, program, agreement or
arrangement; each severance or termination pay, medical, surgical,
hospitalization, life insurance and other "welfare" plan, fund or program
(within the meaning of section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")); each profit-sharing, stock bonus
or other "pension" plan, fund or program (within the meaning of section 3(2)
of ERISA); each employment, termination or severance agreement; and each
other employee benefit plan, fund, program, agreement or arrangement, in each
case, that is sponsored, maintained or contributed to or required to be
contributed to by the Company or by any trade or business, whether or not
incorporated (an "ERISA AFFILIATE"), that together with the Company would be
deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of section 4001(b) of ERISA, or
to which the Company or an ERISA Affiliate is party, whether written or oral,
for the benefit of any employee or former employee of the Company or any
subsidiary (the "EMPLOYEE Plans"). Neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has any legally binding commitment to create any additional
employee benefit plan or modify or change any existing Employee Plan that
would affect any employee or former employee of the Company or
any subsidiary.   (b) With respect to each Employee Plan, the Company
has heretofore delivered to Parent true and complete copies of the Employee
Plan and any amendments thereto (or if the Employee Plan is not a written
Employee Plan, a description thereof), any related trust or other funding
vehicle, any reports or summaries required under ERISA or the Code and the
most recent determination letter received from the Internal Revenue Service
with respect to each Employee Plan intended to qualify under section 401 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE").   (c) None of
the Employee Plans is a "multiemployer plan," as such term is defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA, nor is any Employee Plan subject to 302 or Title IV
of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. No liability under Title IV or section
302 of ERISA has been incurred by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate that has
not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists that presents a material
risk to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring   12   any such
liability, other than liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation ("PBGC") (which premiums have been paid when due).   (d) Neither
the Company or any subsidiary, any Employee Plan, any trust created
thereunder, nor any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a
transaction in connection with which the Company or any subsidiary, any
Employee Plan, any such trust, or any trustee or administrator thereof,
or any party dealing with any Employee Plan or any such trust could be
subject to either a material civil penalty assessed pursuant to section 409
or 502(i) of ERISA or a material tax imposed pursuant to section 4975 or 4976
of the Code.   (e) Each Employee Plan has been operated and administered
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and applicable law,
including but not limited to ERISA and the Code.   (f) Each Employee Plan
intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of section 401(a) of the Code
is so qualified and the trusts maintained thereunder are exempt from taxation
under section 501(a) of the Code. Each Employee Plan intended to satisfy the
requirements of Section 501(c)(9) has satisfied such requirements.   (g) No
Employee Plan provides medical, surgical, hospitalization, death or similar
benefits (whether or not insured) for employees or former employees of the
Company or any subsidiary for periods extending beyond their retirement or
other termination of service, other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable
law, (ii) death benefits under any "pension plan," or (iii) benefits the full
cost of which is borne by the current or former employee (or his
beneficiary).   (h) Except as disclosed in Section 3.11(h) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with
another event, (i) entitle any current or former employee or officer of the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate to severance pay, unemployment compensation or
any other payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, or (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due any such employee or officer.   (i) There are no pending,
threatened or anticipated claims of a material nature by or on behalf of any
Employee Plan, by any employee or beneficiary covered under any such Employee
Plan, or otherwise involving any such Employee Plan (other than routine
claims for benefits).   (j) There are no material controversies pending or,
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened between the Company or any of
its subsidiaries and any of their respective employees. Section 3.11(j) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule lists each collective bargaining agreement or
other labor union contract applicable to persons employed by the Company or
its subsidiaries in the United States. The Company has no knowledge of any
material activities or proceedings of any labor union to organize any
employees of the Company or its subsidiaries. The Company has no knowledge of
any material strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, lockouts or threats thereof
by or with respect to any employees of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries.   13    SECTION 3.12 ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND
REGULATIONS.   (a) Except as set forth in Section 3.12 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and each of its subsidiaries is in
full compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws, which compliance
includes, but is not limited to, the possession by the Company and its
subsidiaries of all permits and other governmental authorizations required
under applicable Environmental Laws, and compliance with the terms and
conditions thereof. Except as set forth in Section 3.12 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has
received any communication (written or oral), whether from a governmental
authority, citizens group, employee or otherwise, that alleges that the
Company or any of its subsidiaries is not in such full compliance. All
permits and other governmental authorizations currently held by the Company
or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to the Environmental Laws are identified
in Section 3.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.   (b) Except as set
forth in Section 3.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no
Environmental Claim pending or threatened against the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Company and its subsidiaries,
against any person or entity whose liability for any Environmental Claim the
Company or any of its subsidiaries has or may have retained or assumed either
contractually or by operation of law.   (c) Except as set forth in Section
3.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no past or present
actions, activities, circumstances, conditions, events or incidents involving
the release, emission, discharge, presence or disposal of any Material of
Environmental Concern that could reasonably form the basis of any
Environmental Claim against the Company or any of its subsidiaries or, to the
knowledge of the Company and its subsidiaries, against any person or entity
whose liability for any Environmental Claim the Company or any of its
subsidiaries has or may have retained or assumed either contractually or by
operation of law.   (d) Without in any way limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) all underground storage tanks, and the capacity and
contents of such tanks, located on property owned, operated, or leased by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries are identified in Section 3.12 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, and (ii) all properties formerly owned or

excluding any such claim(s) that would not individually or in the aggregate
have a Material Adverse Intellectual Property Effect on the Company. None of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify any person
for or against any interference, infringement, misappropriation or other
conflict with respect to any Intellectual Property, except as may be
contained within the licenses or sale agreements, entered into by the Company
in the ordinary course of business in connection with sales of the Company\'s
products, or as set forth in Section 3.14(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.   17    (d) To the Company\'s knowledge, no breach or default
(or event which with notice or lapse of time or both would result in an event
of default) by the Company or any of its subsidiaries exists or has occurred
under any license or other agreement pursuant to which the Company or any of
its subsidiaries uses any Intellectual Property owned by a third party or
has granted any third party the right to use its Intellectual Property, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
violate or conflict with, or constitute a default (or an event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) or result in a
forfeiture under, or constitute a basis for termination of any such license
or other agreement, excluding any violation(s) or conflict(s) that
individually or in the aggregate would not have a Material Adverse
Intellectual Property Effect on the Company.   (e) To the Company\'s
knowledge, the Company or its subsidiaries owns or has the right to use all
items of Intellectual Property necessary to provide, produce, sell and
license the services and products currently provided, produced, sold and
licensed by the Company and its subsidiaries and to conduct the business of
Company and its subsidiaries as currently conducted, free and clear of all
Liens, excluding any items that, if not owned by the Company and not subject
to a valid license in favor of the Company, would not individually or in the
aggregate have a Material Adverse Intellectual Property Effect on the
Company.   (f) To the Company\'s knowledge, the conduct of the
Company\'s and its subsidiaries\' business, the Intellectual Property owned
or used by the Company and its subsidiaries, and the products or services
produced, sold or licensed by the Company and its subsidiaries, do not
infringe any Intellectual Property rights or any other proprietary right of
any person or give rise to any claim or obligations to any person as a result
of co-authorship, co-inventorship, or an express or implied contract for any
use or transfer, excluding any infringement(s), claim(s) or obligation(s)
that would not individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse
Intellectual Property Effect on the Company. None of the Company or its
subsidiaries have received any notice of any written allegations or written
threats that the Company\'s or its subsidiaries\' use of any of the
Intellectual Property infringes upon or is in conflict with any Intellectual
Property or proprietary rights of any other person.   (g) None of the
Company or its subsidiaries have sent or otherwise communicated to any other
person or entity in the twenty-four month period prior to the date hereof any
written claim of any present, impending or threatened infringement of any
Intellectual Property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.   (h) To
the Company\'s knowledge, none of the Company\'s or its subsidiaries\'
products or services incorporate, are based upon or are derived or adapted
from, any Intellectual Property of any other person in violation of
any statutory or other legal obligation or any agreement to which the Company
or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound, excluding
any violation(s) that individually or in the aggregate would not have a
Material Adverse Intellectual Property Effect on the Company.   (i) To the
knowledge of the Company, all of Company\'s Patents, Trademarks and
Copyrights issued by, registered with or filed with the United States Patent
and Trademark Office or Register of Copyrights or the corresponding offices
of other countries and material to the business of the Company as currently
conducted have been duly registered, filed in or issued,   18   as the
case may be, have been properly maintained and renewed in accordance with all
applicable provisions of law and administrative regulations, and the
Company or its subsidiary is the record owner thereof. The Company has used
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of its trade
secrets and other confidential Intellectual Property in accordance with
industry standards, and, to the Company\'s knowledge, there have been no acts
or omissions by the Company, the result of which would be to compromise the
rights of the Company to apply for, obtain or enforce appropriate legal
protection of such Intellectual Property, excluding any loss(es) or
compromise(s) of rights that individually or in the aggregate would not have
a Material Adverse Intellectual Property Effect on the Company.   (j) To
the Company\'s knowledge, no present or former employee, officer, or
independent contractors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries has any
right, title or interest, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, in any
of the Company Intellectual Property Rights, and no current or
former employee(s), officer(s) or independent contractor(s) of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries have asserted any claim, or have any valid claim or
valid right, to any of the Company Intellectual Property Rights, which
claim(s) or right(s) would independently or in the aggregate have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. To the Company\'s knowledge, no employee,
officer or agent of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party to or
otherwise bound by any agreement with or obligated to any other person or
entity (including, any former employer) which conflicts in any material
respect with any obligation or commitment of such employee, officer or agent
to the Company under any agreement to which he or she is a party or
otherwise. To the Company\'s knowledge, each current and former employee,
officer, agent and each independent contractor that developed any Company
Intellectual Property is obligated to transfer to the Company, and will be
obligated to transfer to the Surviving Company any patent applications and
invention disclosures, in consideration for no more than normal salary and
continued employment or consultant fees, as the case may be, all inventions,
developments and work product which during his or her employment
or consultancy with the Company or any of its subsidiaries, such employee,
officer, agent or independent contractor made or makes that related or
relates to any subject matter with which such employee\'s, officer\'s,
agent\'s or independent contractor\'s work for the Company or any of its
subsidiaries was concerned and which were made during such persons employment
or course of agency as the case may be.   (k) To the knowledge of the
Company, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not result in the loss or impairment of any Company Intellectual
Property Rights, excluding any loss or impairment that individually or in the
aggregate would not have a Material Adverse Intellectual Property Effect on
the Company.   (l) Section 3.14(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a complete and accurate list of all existing material agreements
granting to third parties any material right to use or practice any material
rights under the Company Intellectual Property Rights, excluding any non-
exclusive licenses granted to customers in the ordinary course of
business.   SECTION 3.15 VOTE REQUIRED. The Stockholder Approval is
the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the Company\'s capital
stock necessary to approve this Agreement and the Merger.   19   
SECTION 3.16 OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISER. Wasserstein Perella and Co., Inc.
(the "COMPANY FINANCIAL ADVISER") has delivered to the Board of Directors of
the Company its written opinion dated the date of this Agreement to the
effect that as of such date the Merger Consideration is fair to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock from a financial point of view
(the "OPINION"). True and complete copies of the Opinion and the letter of
engagement between the Company and the Company Financial Adviser pursuant to
which the Company Financial Adviser has issued the Opinion and acted as
financial adviser to the Company with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement have been delivered to Parent on or prior to
the date hereof.   SECTION 3.17 BROKERS. No broker, finder or investment
banker other than the Company Financial Adviser is entitled to any brokerage,
finder\'s or other fee or commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of the Company.   SECTION 3.18 PROPERTY.   (a) The Company and each of its
subsidiaries has good, valid and marketable fee title to all of the real
property and assets which it purports to own (the "OWNED PROPERTY"). Each
Owned Property is free of all Liens except for (i) those Liens which are
disclosed on title commitments or reports delivered to Parent prior to the
date hereof, (ii) those matters set forth on Section 3.18(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, (iii) Liens for taxes not yet due and payable, or (iv)
Liens which could not, individually, or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to materially impair the current use, occupancy, value,
financeability or marketability of title to the Real Property on a property-
by-property basis. The Owned Property and the Leased Property (as defined
below) constitute all such property necessary to permit the Company and each
of its subsidiaries to conduct, and continue to conduct, its business
as currently conducted in all material respects and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will not alter or impair such ability in
any material respect.   (b) Section 3.18(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule contains an accurate and complete list of all leases (the "LEASES")
(setting forth the address of the premises demised thereunder, the lessor and
the lessee (and any sublessor or sublessee, as appropriate)) pursuant to
which the Company and each of its subsidiaries leases real or personal
property (the "LEASED PROPERTY"). The Company and each of its subsidiaries
holds good and valid leasehold title to all of the Leased Property. All of
the Leases are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their terms,
and are in full force and effect, and there are no existing defaults by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries thereunder; no event of default has
occurred which (whether with or without notice, lapse of time or the
happening or occurrence of any other event) would constitute a default
thereunder, except in any such case where the invalidity or default would not
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Section
3.18(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule all lessors under such Leases have
consented (where such consent is necessary) to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein without requiring modification in the rights
or obligations of the lessee under such Leases. The Company or its
subsidiaries have delivered true, correct and complete copies of all of the
Leases.   20    SECTION 3.19 CONTRACTS. (a) Except as set forth in
the Company\'s SEC Reports or Section 3.19 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to or
bound by (i) any "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item
601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (ii) any non-competition agreement
or any other agreement or obligation which purports to limit in any respect
the manner in which, or the localities in which, all or any material portion
of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, may be
conducted, (iii) any transaction, agreement, arrangement or understanding
with any Affiliate (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act) that would
be required to be disclosed under Item 404 of regulation S-K under the
Securities Act, (iv) any voting or other agreement governing how any Company
Common Stock shall be voted, (v) any material agreement with any stockholders
of the Company, (vi) any acquisition, merger, asset purchase or sale
agreement (all contracts of the type described in clauses (i) - (vi) being
referred to herein as "Company Material Contracts"). Each Company Material
Contract is valid and binding on the Company (or, to the extent a subsidiary
of the Company is a party, such subsidiary) and is in full force and effect,
and the Company and each subsidiary of the Company have, in all material
respects, performed all obligations required to be performed by them to date
under each Company Material Contract, except where such noncompliance,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company nor any subsidiary of the Company has received
written notice of any violation or default under (nor, to the knowledge of
the Company, is there any existing condition which with the passage of time
or the giving of notice or both would result in such a violation or default
under) any Company Material Contract.   SECTION 3.20 STATE TAKEOVER
STATUTES. The Company\'s Board of Directors has approved this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and has taken all action required at
this time such that the limitations on control share acquisitions and
business combinations contained in Sections 78.378 through 78.3793 inclusive
and Sections 78.411 through 78.444 inclusive of the NRS (and any similar
provisions) are inapplicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. No other "fair price," "merger
moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other anti-takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation applies or purports to apply to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.   ARTICLE IV 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF  PARENT AND ACQUISITION   Except as
publicly disclosed by Parent in the Parent SEC Reports and except as set
forth on the Disclosure Schedule (it being agreed that disclosure of any item

DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE"), Parent and Acquisition hereby represent and warrant to
the Company as follows:   21    SECTION 4.1 ORGANIZATION.   (a) Each of
Parent and Acquisition is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its respective state of incorporation and has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its businesses as now being conducted. Parent has
heretofore delivered to the Company accurate and complete copies of the
Constitution (or equivalent organizational documents) or Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws, as the case may be, as currently in effect of
Parent and Acquisition.   (b) Each of Parent and Acquisition is duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. The term "PARENT MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" means any changes
or effects that, individually or in the aggregate, are materially adverse to
the ability of Parent and Acquisition to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, other than any changes or effects arising out of (i)
conditions generally affecting industries in which Parent operates or (ii)
the entering into or the public announcement or disclosure of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby.   SECTION 4.2 AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO
THIS AGREEMENT. Each of Parent and Acquisition has all necessary corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent and the consummation by Parent of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action of Parent and Acquisition and by Parent as the sole
stockholder of Acquisition and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Parent or Acquisition are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Acquisition and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company,
constitutes a valid, legal and binding agreement of each of Parent and
Acquisition enforceable against each of Parent and Acquisition in accordance
with its terms.   SECTION 4.3 INFORMATION SUPPLIED. None of the
information supplied by Parent or Acquisition in writing for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement will, at the time that the Proxy Statement is mailed to the
Company\'s stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders\' Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent
with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein.   SECTION 4.4 CONSENTS AND APPROVALS; NO VIOLATIONS.

for the execution and delivery by Parent or Acquisition of this Agreement or
the consummation by Parent or Acquisition of the transactions contemplated
hereby, except where the failure to obtain such permits, authorizations,
consents or approvals or to make such filings or give such notice would not
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Parent or Acquisition nor the consummation
by Parent or Acquisition of the transactions contemplated hereby will (a)
conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of the respective
Constitution (or equivalent organizational documents) or Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws, as the case may be, of Parent or Acquisition or any
of Parent\'s other subsidiaries, (b) to Parent\'s knowledge, violate any
order, writ, injunction, decree, law, statute, rule or regulation applicable
to Parent or Acquisition or any of Parent\'s other subsidiaries or any of
their respective properties or assets except, in the case of (b), for
violations, breaches or defaults which would not have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.5 ADEQUATE FUNDS. Parent will have at the
Effective Time sufficient funds for the payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration.   SECTION 4.6 NO PRIOR ACTIVITIES. Except for
obligations incurred in connection with its incorporation or organization or
the negotiation and consummation of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, Acquisition has neither incurred any obligation or
liability nor engaged in any business or activity of any type or kind
whatsoever or entered into any agreement or arrangement with any person.

determines in good faith that such proposal would, if so completed, result in
a Superior Proposal (as defined below), (iii) the Board of Directors of the

to any other person in connection with any Takeover Proposal which was not
previously provided to Parent. The Company will keep Parent informed of the
status and details of any such Takeover Proposal and of any amendments or
proposed amendments to any Takeover Proposal and will promptly (but in no
case later than 48 hours) notify Parent of any determination by
the Company\'s Board of Directors that a Superior Proposal has been made.  
(d) Except as set forth in this Section 5.2(d), neither the Board of
Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, modify

Directors of the Company or any such committee of this Agreement or the
Merger, (ii) adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve or
recommend, any Takeover Proposal, (iii) enter into any agreement with respect
to any Takeover Proposal or (iv) resolve or agree to take any of the actions
set forth in clauses (i) through (iii). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
subject to compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.2, at any time
prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors may (x)
withdraw, modify or amend its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or
the Merger, (y) approve or recommend an unsolicited written Superior
Proposal, or (z) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.2(i) hereof
following the making of a unsolicited written Superior Proposal, in each
case, (1) if, and to the extent the Board of Directors, based on the advice
of outside legal counsel, by a majority vote determines in good faith that
the failure to take such action would constitute a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the holders of Company Common Stock under applicable law, and (2)
provided that, concurrently with any such termination of this Agreement under
clause (z) above, (a) the Company shall enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal and (b) the Company shall pay the
Termination Fee and Expenses in accordance with Section 7.5 hereof.   (e)
"TAKEOVER PROPOSAL" means any bona fide proposal or offer, whether in writing
or otherwise and whether or not delivered to the Company\'s stockholders
generally, from any person other than Parent, Acquisition or any affiliates
thereof (a "Third Party") to acquire beneficial ownership (as determined
pursuant to Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of all or a material portion
of the assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or 20% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant
to a merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of
capital stock, sale of assets, tender    28   offer, exchange offer or
similar transaction with respect to either the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, including any single or multi-step transaction or series of
related transactions, which is structured to permit such Third Party to
acquire beneficial ownership of any material portion of the assets of or
20% or more of the equity interest in either the Company or any of its
subsidiaries.   (f) "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means any bona fide proposal by
a Third Party to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration
consisting of cash and/or securities, more than a majority of the shares of
Company Common Stock then outstanding or all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company or to acquire, directly or indirectly, the Company by
merger or consolidation, and otherwise on terms which the Board of Directors
of the Company determines in good faith to be more favorable to the
Company\'s stockholders (taking into account the time period reasonably
believed necessary to consummate such transaction) than the Merger (based on
advice of the Company\'s independent financial advisor that the value of the
consideration provided for in such proposal is superior to the value of the
consideration provided for in the Merger), for which financing, to the extent
required, is then fully committed.   (g) Nothing contained herein shall
prohibit the Company from disclosing to its stockholders the position or
statement contemplated by Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act with
respect to a Takeover Proposal by means of a tender offer.   SECTION 5.3
PREPARATION OF THE PROXY STATEMENT; STOCKHOLDERS\'  MEETING.   (a) As
promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, and in no
event later than 30 days after the date hereof, the Company shall prepare and
file with the SEC the Proxy Statement. The Company shall obtain and furnish
the information required to be included in the Proxy Statement and shall
respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement and cause the Proxy Statement and form of proxy to be mailed to the
Company\'s stockholders at the earliest practicable date. Parent shall
cooperate in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and shall as soon as
practicable after the date hereof furnish the Company with all information
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement as the Company may reasonably request.
The Company agrees, as to information supplied by the Company, its officers,
directors, stockholders and subsidiaries contained in the Proxy Statement,
and Parent agrees, as to information supplied by Parent and its officers,
directors, stockholders and subsidiaries contained in the Proxy Statement
that such information, at the date the Proxy Statement is mailed, (as amended
or supplemented) at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting and
the Effective Time, will not be false or misleading with respect to any
material fact, or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. Parent and its counsel
shall be given the reasonable opportunity to review the Proxy Statement and
all amendments or supplements thereof prior to their being filed with the
SEC, and the Company shall not make any such filing without consulting with
Parent. The Company will advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Proxy Statement has been cleared by the SEC or
any request by the SEC for an amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments
from the SEC thereon and proposed responses thereto or requests by the SEC
for additional information. The Company shall also promptly provide Parent
with copies of any correspondence received from SEC, and shall permit
representatives of Parent to participate in    29   any telephone call
with the SEC which discusses comments made by the staff. The Company, on the
one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by either of them for use in the Proxy Statement if any,
if and to the extent that it shall have become materially false or
misleading, and the Company further agrees to take all steps
reasonably necessary to cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected to be filed
with the SEC and to use all reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement
to be disseminated to the Company\'s stockholders, in each case, as and to
the extent required by applicable laws.   (b) Parent agrees promptly to
advise the Company if at any time prior to the Company Stockholders\' Meeting
any information provided by it in the Proxy Statement is or becomes incorrect
or incomplete in any material respect and to provide the Company with the
information needed to correct such inaccuracy or omission. Parent will
furnish the Company with such supplemental information as may be necessary in
order to cause the Proxy Statement, insofar as it relates to Parent and its
subsidiaries, to comply with applicable law after the mailing thereof to the
stockholders of the Company.   (c) The Company agrees promptly to advise
Parent if at any time prior to the Company Stockholders\' Meeting any
information provided by it in the Proxy Statement is or becomes incorrect or
incomplete in any material respect and to provide Parent with the information
needed to correct such inaccuracy or omission. The Company will furnish
Parent with such supplemental information as may be necessary in order to
cause the Proxy Statement, insofar as it relates to the Company and its
subsidiaries, to comply with applicable law after the mailing thereof to the
stockholders of the Company.   (d) As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders\' Meeting for the
purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approval. Subject to the fiduciary
duties of its Board of Directors, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to
solicit proxies from its stockholders and to secure the vote or consent of
stockholders required by applicable law or otherwise to obtain the
Stockholder Approval. Subject to Section 5.2(d), the Company, through its
Board of Directors, shall recommend to its stockholders the approval of this
Agreement and the Merger.   SECTION 5.4 ACCESS TO INFORMATION;
CONFIDENTIALITY.   (a) Upon notice by Parent and permission by the Company,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, the Company shall, and
shall cause its subsidiaries to, afford Parent, and the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives
of Parent, reasonable access during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time, and in a manner reasonably designed to minimize
disruption to the operations of the Company, to all their respective
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during
such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to,
furnish promptly to Parent, (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities laws and (b) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request. Except as required by law, each of the Company and Parent
will hold, and will cause its respective officers, employees,
accountants,    30   counsel, financial advisers and other
representatives and affiliates to hold, any confidential information in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.   (b)(i) Subject to the
conditions set forth elsewhere in this Section 5.4, Parent shall be entitled
at its sole expense at reasonable times, and in a manner reasonably designed
to minimize disruption to the operations of the Company, to conduct due
diligence on the Company\'s owned or leased real property ("Property") and
building systems thereon, including but not limited to, title, the interior
of any improvements and the structural elements thereof, and including but
not limited to a Phase I and Phase II environmental assessment of the
Property, including testing and sampling for the presence of any Materials of
Environmental Concern, and any other test, analysis or inspection of the
Property deemed appropriate by Parent in Parent\'s sole discretion, and the
results of such inspection shall be satisfactory to Parent in Parent\'s
sole discretion.   (ii) The Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries
to, fully cooperate with Parent\'s due diligence and Parent shall have access
to the Property and to the Company\'s and its subsidiaries\' personnel
knowledgeable about environmental matters at the Property during normal
business hours to perform the due diligence, including inspection and
sampling by Parent or Parent\'s employees, agents, representatives,
contractors, or subcontractors.   (iii) Parent shall cause any contractor
("CONTRACTOR") retained to conduct the Phase I or Phase II environmental
assessment of the Property, or to conduct any other physical inspections of
the Property that requires access thereto, to maintain with an insurance
company or companies that are properly licensed, the following types of
insurance to cover the Contractor\'s activities at the Property: (x)
comprehensive general liability insurance with a limit of not less than
$2,000,000 per occurrence; (y) automobile liability insurance with a limit of
not less than $2,000,000 per occurrence; and (z) errors and omission
insurance with a limit of not less than $2,000,000 per occurrence. Such
insurance coverage shall list the Company as an additional insured.
Contractor shall also maintain or cause to be maintained worker\'s
compensation insurance with limits of liability not less than those required
by law.   (iv) Subsequent to performing any inspection or testing of
the Property, Parent shall promptly restore the Property to the condition
that existed immediately prior to Contractor\'s entrance upon the Property,
and agrees to repair, restore, or replace any and all damage to the Property
caused by Parent\'s or Contractor\'s activities. Parent shall be responsible
to lawfully dispose of any soil or groundwater removed by Contractor from the
surface or subsurface of the Property. Parent agrees that it shall indemnify
and hold Company harmless from any and all claims, damages (including
personal injury and property damage), and other liabilities arising out of
and to the extent caused by the acts of Contractor or Parent while present on
the Property.   (v) Parent agrees to provide Company with a copy of all
Phase I and Phase II environmental reports, and any other report arising from
Parent\'s inspection of the Property.   SECTION 5.5 REASONABLE BEST
EFFORTS; NOTIFICATION.   (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition
agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or    31   cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate in the most expeditious manner practicable
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the making of
all necessary applications, registrations and filings (including filings
with Governmental Entities, if any, and making the filings and taking such
other actions as are required by Section 5.11 hereof), (ii) the obtaining of
all necessary actions or nonactions, licenses, consents, approvals or waivers
from Governmental Entities and other third parties, including, without
limitation, all Governmental Approvals (as hereinafter defined), (iii) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of,
this Agreement and (iv) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the using of
all reasonable best efforts necessary to lift, rescind, vacate or mitigate
the effect of any stay, injunction or restraining order or other order
adversely affecting the ability of any party hereto to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.   (b) The Company shall give prompt
written notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt written notice to the
Company, of (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this
Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or (ii) the
failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement. Each of Parent and Acquisition, on the one hand, and the Company,
on the other hand, hereby represent that, other than as previously disclosed
to each other on the Disclosure Schedule (which disclosure shall not
constitute a breach), as of the date hereof they do not have actual knowledge
of a breach of the representations and warranties being made by the other
party, PROVIDED HOWEVER that a party alleging a breach of the representation
or warranty made by the other party pursuant to this sentence must reasonably
demonstrate that such other party did in fact possess such actual knowledge.
Parent and Acquisition on the one hand and the Company on the other hand each
hereby represent that they have not provided any information to the other or
made any statements to the other which would (or with the passage of time
would) be reasonably likely to permit or allow such party to claim that the
other party did indeed possess such actual knowledge. No notice given
pursuant to this paragraph shall have any effect on the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement for purposes
of determining satisfaction of any condition contained herein.   SECTION
5.6 TAKEOVER STATUTES; INCONSISTENT ACTIONS. If any "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share," "business combination," "shareholder
protection" or similar or other anti-takeover statute or
regulation (including, without limitation, Sections 78.378 through 78.3793
and Sections 78.411 through 78.444 of the NRS) shall become applicable to the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or by the Voting
Agreement, the Company and the Board of Directors of the Company shall grant
such approvals and take all such actions so that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and by the Voting Agreement may be
consummated on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise eliminate the
effects of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby.   SECTION 5.7 INDEMNIFICATION, EXCULPATION AND
INSURANCE.    32    (a) The Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect
to indemnification and exculpation from liability set forth in the
Company\'s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws on the date of this
Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
individuals who on or prior to the Effective Time were directors, officers,
employees or agents of the Company, unless such modification is required by
law.   (b) For a period of the applicable statute of limitations after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless
(and shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law to, subject to the provision by such person of
an undertaking to reimburse the amounts so advanced in the event of a
final non-appealable determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that
such person is not entitled thereto) each person who is or has been prior to
the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or
director of the Company or any of the Company\'s subsidiaries (the
"INDEMNIFIED PERSONS") against (a) all losses, claims, damages, costs,
expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and out-of-
pocket expenses), settlement payments or liabilities arising out of or in
connection with any claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact
that such person is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time and whether or not asserted or claimed prior to or at
or after the Effective Time ("INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES") and (b) all
Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or
in part out of or pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case to the fullest extent required or permitted
under applicable law or under the Surviving Corporation\'s Articles
of Incorporation or Bylaws to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
law. The parties hereto intend, to the extent not prohibited by applicable
law, that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.7(b) shall apply
without limitation to negligent acts or omissions by an Indemnified person.
Parent hereby guarantees the payment and performance of the Surviving
Corporation\'s obligations in this Section 5.7(b). Each Indemnified person is
intended to be a third party beneficiary of this Section 5.7(b) and may
specifically enforce its terms. This Section 5.7(b) shall not limit or
otherwise adversely effect any rights any Indemnified person may have under
any indemnification agreement disclosed on Section 5.7(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or under the Company\'s Articles of Incorporation or
Bylaws.   (c) For four years from the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time covering those persons who are currently covered by the
Company\'s directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy (a copy of
which has been heretofore made available to Parent) on terms no less
favorable to such indemnified parties than those of such policy in effect on
the date hereof; PROVIDED that, in satisfying its obligations under Section
5.8(d) the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay premiums in
excess of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full
fiscal year, which amount the Company has disclosed to Parent in writing
prior to the date hereof; PROVIDED FURTHER that if the premium for such
coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase a
policy with the greatest coverage reasonably available for such 300% of
the annual premium; provided    33   however that Parent shall be
entitled to satisfy its obligations under this Section 5.7(c) by purchasing a
"tail" policy providing for comparable coverage.   (d) The obligations of
the Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent contained in this Section
5.7 shall be binding on the successors and assigns of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.7.   SECTION 5.8 FEES AND EXPENSES. Except as
provided in Section 7.5, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses.  
SECTION 5.9 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Parent and Acquisition, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, will not issue any press release or other
public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, without first obtaining the prior consent of
the other party; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, in the event of any press release that
may be required by applicable law, court process, or by obligations pursuant
to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange,
the Australian Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ National Market, the parties will
use reasonable best efforts to consult with each other before issuing, and
to provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any such
press release or other public statement.   SECTION 5.10 STATUS OF COMPANY
EMPLOYEES; EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.   (a) Parent agrees that following the
Effective Time, the employees of the Company and its subsidiaries who are
employed by the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries ("COMPANY
EMPLOYEES") shall become eligible within six months of Effective Time to

Parent or its subsidiaries for its U.S. employees ("PARENT BENEFIT PLANS"),
in the same manner as similarly situated employees of Parent. Prior to the
date the Company Employees become eligible to participate in Parent Benefit
Plans, they shall continue to participate in the employee benefit plans and
arrangements in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent or its
subsidiaries shall grant the Company Employees credit for all service
credited by the Company for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
the determination of benefits under vacation and severance pay plans. Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, offer employment to all
employees of the Company employed by the Company as of the Effective Time,
and honor in accordance with their terms all employee benefit obligations to
current and former employees under the Employee Plans in existence on the
date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall
affect Parent\'s or the Surviving Corporation\'s right to terminate the
employment of any Company Employee following the Effective Time or to amend
or terminate any Employee in accordance with its terms.    34    (b)
Any pre-existing condition exclusion under any Parent Benefit Plan providing
medical or dental benefits shall be waived for any Company Employee who,
immediately prior to commencing participation in such Parent Benefit Plan,
was participating in an Employee Plan providing medical or dental benefits
and had satisfied any pre-existing condition provision under such Employee
Plan.   (c) Any expenses that were taken into account under an Employee
Plan providing medical or dental benefits in which the Company
Employee participated immediately prior to commencing participation in a
Parent Benefit Plan providing medical or dental benefits shall be taken into
account to the same extent under such Parent Benefit Plan, in accordance with
the terms of such Parent Benefit Plan, for purposes of satisfying applicable
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions and life-time
benefit limits.   SECTION 5.11 GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS.   (a) The parties
hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts
(and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
directors and officers to do so) to (i) promptly prepare and file and, in any
event, will file no later than 30 days after the date hereof, all necessary
documentation to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings
necessary or advisable to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) to obtain as promptly as practicable
all permits, registrations, licenses, findings of suitability, consents,
variances, exemptions, orders, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities (including Licenses in respect of
any Gaming Law) which are necessary or advisable to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including all
required initial application and documents in connection with obtaining
approvals under the Gaming Laws ("GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS"). The parties
hereto shall file initial applications and documents related to all other
Governmental Approvals within such time as necessary for such Governmental
Approvals to be granted on or before the effective date of the respective
approvals required under applicable Gaming Laws and (ii) comply (and cause
their respective directors and officers and employees to so comply) with the
terms and conditions of all such Governmental Approvals. Each of the parties
hereto shall act reasonably and promptly in responding to additional requests
in connection with filing for or otherwise attempting to obtain or renew any
Governmental Approvals. Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company (the "NOTIFYING PARTY") will notify the other promptly of the
receipt of comments, requests or other material communications from
Governmental Entities relating to Governmental Approvals, and will supply the
other party with copies of all material correspondence between the Notifying
Party or any of its representatives and Governmental Entities with respect to
Governmental Approvals; provided, however, that it shall not be required to
supply the other party with copies of correspondence relating to the personal
applications of individual applicants except for evidence of filing.   (b)
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
Parent shall have no obligation or affirmative duty under this Section 5.8 to
cease or refrain from the ownership of any assets or properties, or the
association with any person or entity which association is material to the
operations of Parent, whether on the date hereof or at any time in
the future.    35    ARTICLE VI  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT   SECTION 6.1

Parent of such breach or untruth and of a nature such that the conditions
set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b), as the case may be, would
be incapable of being satisfied by the then-scheduled Outside Date;   (d)
by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Entity shall have issued
an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently enjoining,
restraining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and such
order, decree or ruling or other action shall have become final and
nonappealable;   (e) by either Parent or the Company, if the Merger shall
not have occurred by July 31, 2001 (as it may be extended, the "OUTSIDE
DATE"), unless the failure to consummate the Merger is the result of a breach
of covenant set forth in this Agreement or a material breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement by the party seeking
to terminate this Agreement; PROVIDED that either party may extend the
Outside Date, but no more than four times in the aggregate, and each time by
one month, but in no event beyond November 30, 2001, by providing written
notice thereof to the other party between three (3) and five (5) business
days prior to the next scheduled Outside Date if (i) the Merger shall not
have been consummated by such date because the requisite Governmental
Approvals required under Section 6.2(d) have not been obtained and are still
being pursued, (ii) the party seeking to extend has satisfied all the
conditions to Closing required to be satisfied by it and has not violated any
of its obligations under this Agreement in a manner that was the cause of or
resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before the Outside Date,
and (iii) it is reasonably probable, based on, among other things, the status
of completed regulatory filings, scheduled regulatory meetings and the
advice    38   of regulatory counsel to such party, that the requisite
Governmental Approvals will be obtained within such extension period;
PROVIDED HOWEVER that the Company shall not be permitted to extend the
Outside Date if it has breached the first sentence of Section 5.3(a); and
PROVIDED FURTHER HOWEVER that if the only Governmental Approvals that have
not been obtained are those of the Gaming Authorities in any state in which
Parent is not licensed as at the date hereof but where the Company is so
licensed, then Parent may not extend the Outside Date, and shall be required
to close (assuming all other conditions are then satisfied or waived, and
assuming Parent can do so without violating applicable Gaming Laws),
notwithstanding the failure to obtain such Governmental Approvals, but the
parties agree to reasonably cooperate in such event to enable the Company to
minimize the economic consequences to the Company of such action and to
discharge its remaining obligations under existing contracts, and to
ensure compliance with applicable Gaming Laws;   (f) by Parent (PROVIDED
that the terminating party is not in material breach of any of its
obligations hereunder), if the Stockholder Approval shall not have been
obtained at a duly held meeting of the Company\'s stockholders or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof; or   (g) by Parent, if the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof withdraws or modifies or
amends adversely its recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger following
the receipt by the Company of a Takeover Proposal or shall have resolved to
do so, (ii) recommends a Takeover Proposal to the Company\'s stockholders or
shall have resolved to do so, or (iii) the Board of Directors of the Company
determines to accept a Superior Proposal or shall have entered into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal;   (h) by Parent,
if there shall have been a material breach of any provision of Section
5.2;   (i) by the Company, prior to the Stockholder Approval, if the Board
of Directors determines to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
an unsolicited written Superior Proposal; provided that the Company
has complied with all of the provisions of Section 5.2(d) hereof, and that it
makes simultaneous payment to Parent of the Termination Fee and Expenses;
or   (j) by the Company, within 48 hours of February 16, 2001, if Parent
shall not have delivered to the Company by February 16, 2001,
written customary commitment letters from banks or other financial
institutions of national or international repute, to provide funds sufficient
for the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration.   SECTION 7.2 EFFECT
OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the
Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the
part of Parent, Acquisition or the Company or their respective officers or
directors, except as set forth in the last sentence of Section 5.4(a),
Section 5.9, this Section 7.2, Section 7.5 and Article VIII which shall
survive termination and except to the extent that such termination results
from the breach by a party of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, PROVIDED
that in the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to   
39   Section 7.1(j) hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
have no effect on Parent, Acquisition or the Company or their respective
officers or directors, and such termination shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the parties in such circumstance and neither Parent nor
Acquisition, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, shall have
any further remedy against the other, except as set forth in the last
sentence of Section 5.4(a), Section 5.9, this Section 7.2 and Article VIII
which shall survive such termination.   SECTION 7.3 AMENDMENT. This
Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time in accordance with
applicable law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.   SECTION 7.4 EXTENSION;
WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may (a) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other party contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso of Section
7.3, waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing, signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.   SECTION 7.5
TERMINATION FEE.   In the event (i) the Company terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(i) or (ii) Parent terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(g) or Section 7.1(h), then in each case Parent and
Acquisition would suffer direct and substantial damages, which damages cannot
be ascertained with reasonable certainty, and hence to compensate Parent and
Acquisition for such damages, and as liquidated damages and not a penalty,
and as the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Acquisition against the
Company for the damages suffered, the Company shall pay to Parent, at the
time of termination, an amount equal to $6.25 million (the "TERMINATION FEE")
and an amount equal to Parent\'s and Acquisition\'s actual and documented
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent or Acquisition in
connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the
reasonable fees and expenses payable to all attorneys, accountants,
investment banking firms and their respective agents incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, but in any event not to exceed
$1.75 million (the "EXPENSES"). In addition, if this Agreement is terminated
by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(e) or Section 7.1(f)
or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b) and at the time of such termination,
Parent is not in material breach of this Agreement, then the Company shall
(but only if the termination is pursuant to Section 7.1(f) or 7.1(b)), pay to
Parent, at the time of termination, the Expenses, and, if the Company shall,
within 9 months after such termination, enter into an agreement with respect
to a Takeover Proposal, then the Company shall pay the Termination Fee and
other Expenses (to the extent not previously paid) concurrently with entering
into any such agreement, PROVIDED that no Termination Fee or Expenses shall
be payable in the event of a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(e)
hereof unless (i) prior to any such termination, a Takeover Proposal shall
have been made and not withdrawn, and (ii) such termination is not solely the
result of a failure to obtain the requisite Governmental Approvals   
40   from Gaming Authorities required under Section 6.2(d). Any payments
required to be made pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall be made by wire
transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent.   ARTICLE
