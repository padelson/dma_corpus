WHEREAS, Seller desires to sell, transfer, assign, convey, and deliver to
Buyer all assets, properties, and rights of Seller used in the Business, and
Buyer desires to purchase, acquire, and accept the same, subject to the

certain services in connection with the operation of the Business for a period
of time following the Closing.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, agreements, and

Price").

Escrow Agent, and (iii) assume the Assumed Liabilities as provided in Section
1.1(c).

1.3 Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) No fewer than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement")
setting forth Seller's good faith estimate of Net Working Capital (the
"Estimated Net Working Capital") and the Closing Indebtedness (the "Estimated
Closing Indebtedness"). After delivery to Buyer of the Estimated Closing
Statement and prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer and its
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, to the books, records, and other materials that Seller used
to prepare the Estimated Closing Statement as reasonably requested by Buyer.

(b) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 90 days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the
"Revised Closing Statement") setting forth Buyer's good faith calculation of
Net Working Capital (the "Revised Net Working Capital") and the Closing
Indebtedness (the "Revised Closing Indebtedness"). During the Review Period,
Buyer shall provide Seller and its Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the books, records, and
other materials that Buyer used to prepare the Revised Closing Statement as
reasonably requested by Seller.

(c) If Seller disagrees with any of the items included in the Revised Closing
Statement, Seller may, on or prior to the last day of the Review Period,
deliver a Notice of Disagreement to Buyer. If Seller does not timely deliver a
Notice of Disagreement with respect to the Revised Closing Statement, the
Revised Closing Statement delivered by Buyer pursuant to Section 1.3(b) will
be final and binding on the Parties and the Revised Net Working Capital will

05466425.6 6

* * *



be deemed the Final Net Working Capital and the Revised Closing Indebtedness
will be deemed the Final Closing Indebtedness. If Seller timely delivers a
Notice of Disagreement with respect to the Revised Closing Statement, then (i)
during the Resolution Period, Buyer and Seller shall seek in good faith to
resolve any Disputed Items; and (ii) all items included in the Revised Closing
Statement that Seller does not include in such Notice of Disagreement will be
final and binding on the Parties. During such Resolution Period, each Party
shall provide the other Party and its Representatives with reasonable access,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the books,
records, and other materials that such other Party reasonably requests
relating to such Notice of Disagreement and such Disputed Items.

(d) If, at the end of the Resolution Period, Buyer and Seller have not
resolved each Disputed Item with respect to the Revised Closing Statement,
then either Buyer or Seller may submit such unresolved Disputed Items to the
Independent Accounting Firm for review and resolution. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall, and Buyer and Seller shall instruct the Independent
Accounting Firm to, (i) act as an expert and not as an arbitrator, (ii) make a
final determination based solely on the applicable provisions of this
Agreement and not by independent review, (iii) base its decision on a single
presentation submitted in writing by each of Buyer and Seller and on one
written response to each such presentation (unless the Independent Accounting
Firm requests an additional response from either Buyer or Seller), and not by
independent review, (iv) with respect to each unresolved Disputed Item, render
a determination that must be within the ranges of values claimed by each of
Buyer and Seller, and (v) render a final determination for each Disputed Item
within 45 days following the end of the Resolution Period. During such 45-day
period, each of Buyer and Seller shall provide the Independent Accounting Firm
with reasonable access to information relating to any Disputed Item. The fees
and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm with respect to the resolution
of the Disputed Items in accordance with this Section 1.3 will be borne in
equal parts by Seller and Buyer. The final determination of each Disputed Item
as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm will be final and binding on
the Parties, absent manifest error, and will be utilized in the computation of
the payments contemplated by Section 1.3.

(e) If the Final Adjustment Amount exceeds the Estimated Adjustment Amount,
then, within five Business Days following the final determination of the Final
Adjustment Amount in accordance with this Section 1.3, Buyer shall promptly
pay to Seller the amount of such excess by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts designated by Seller. If the
Estimated Adjustment Amount exceeds the Final Adjustment Amount, then, within
five Business Days after the final determination of the Final Adjustment
Amount in accordance with this Section 1.3, Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer
the amount of such excess by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account or accounts designated by Buyer.

(f) The Estimated Closing Statement and Revised Closing Statement, as well as
all estimates, calculations, and determinations therein, will be prepared and
calculated in accordance with GAAP and otherwise using the methodology set
forth on Annex B (the "Adjustment Methodology"). An example calculation of Net
Working Capital Target using the Adjustment Methodology is also set forth on
Annex B.

05466425.6 7

* * *



(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the review and
Disputed Items procedures set forth in this Section 1.3 are the exclusive
mechanisms for resolving disputes regarding Net Working Capital and any
component thereof.

(h) Any payment made under this Section 1.3 will constitute an adjustment to
the Purchase Price, unless (i) a final determination with respect to any such
payment causes such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price for Tax purposes or (ii) as otherwise required by applicable Law.

1.4 Closing. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Article
VI, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents (collectively, the "Transactions") will take
place remotely, effective as of 12:00:01 a.m. Eastern Time, by exchange of
documents and signatures via email, facsimile, or DocuSign on the third
Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) of all conditions to the obligations of the Parties to
consummate the Transactions (the "Closing") (other than those conditions that
by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) or such other date, place, time,
or manner as the Parties may agree; provided that, notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Buyer shall not be required to effect the Closing
prior to the date that is fourteen calendar days after the date hereof. The
date of the Closing is referred to as the "Closing Date".

subsections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and
subsections contained in this Agreement. The disclosures in any section or
subsection of the Seller Disclosure Letter corresponding to any section or

and Representatives to, (i) immediately cease and terminate any existing
discussion or negotiation with any Person (other than Buyer, Parent, and their
respective Representatives) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to enforce their respective rights under, and
not release any Person from, the confidentiality, nondisclosure, and other
similar Contracts with such Persons (other than Buyer, Parent, and their
respective Representatives), and (iii) use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
recover, or remove access to, all information concerning Seller in the
possession of such Persons and their respective

05466425.6 30

* * *



Representatives (other than information provided to such Persons in the
Ordinary Course for purposes unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal).

4.4 Governmental Approvals. During the Executory Period:

(a) The Parties shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to determine the
filings and notifications required to be made with, or consents that are
required to be obtained from, any Third Party under the terms of any Material
Contract included in the Acquired Assets or Government Entity under any
applicable Law in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions, in addition to those addressed in
Section 4.4(b). Subject to the remainder of this Section 4.4, Buyer, on the
one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall, and shall cause their
respective Representatives to, promptly file or make or cause to be filed or
made, and use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain or cause to be
obtained as promptly as practicable, all necessary filings with and consents
of such Third Parties or Government Entities.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of Section 4.4(a), the Parties shall
use best efforts to take or cause to be taken all other actions necessary,
proper, or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods, or receipt of required authorizations, as applicable, under
any applicable Antitrust Law as soon as reasonably practicable after the date
of this Agreement. If required by the Antitrust Laws in the reasonable
judgment of Buyer and if the appropriate filings pursuant to the Antitrust
Laws have not been filed prior to the date hereof, each Party agrees to file
with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report
Form Relating to this Agreement within 10 Business Days from the date of this
Agreement, which filings shall request early termination of the HSR waiting
period. The Parties shall use best efforts to (i) cooperate in connection with
any filing, submission, or response to any written or oral requests from
Government Entities for additional information or documentary evidence,
including providing each other with advance copies and a reasonable
opportunity to comment on all material proposed notices, submissions, filings,
applications, undertakings, and information and correspondence proposed to be
supplied to or filed with any Government Entities, except the Parties' HSR
filings, (ii) cooperate and provide one another reasonable advance notice of,
and the opportunity to consult regarding, all substantive meetings with
Government Entities, whether in person or by electronic or telephonic means,
and regarding all written communications with Government Entities, in each
case, in connection with the Transactions, and (iii) promptly provide each
other with copies of all written communications to or from any Government
Entity (except for HSR filings); provided that the materials required to be
provided pursuant to this Section 4.4(b) may be redacted (A) to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Acquired Assets, (B) as necessary
to comply with contractual obligations, (C) as necessary to comply with
applicable Law, and (D) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or
confidentiality concerns; provided further that a Party may reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to another Party under
this Section 4.4(b) as "Outside Counsel Only". No Party shall, and each party
shall not permit any of its Representatives to, participate in any substantive
meeting with any Government Entity in respect of any filings, investigation,
or other inquiry unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to
the extent permitted by such Government Entity, gives the other Party the

05466425.6 31

* * *



opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Except in the event of a
Burdensome Condition, the Parties shall not willfully take any action that
delays, impairs, or impedes the receipt of any required consents,
authorizations, Orders, or approvals.

(c) As used in Section 4.4(b), "best efforts" means the best efforts of the
each Party, but will not require any Party or any of their respective
Affiliates to (1) sell or hold separate and agree to sell, divest,
discontinue, or limit, before or after the Closing, any of their respective
assets or businesses; (2) make any material conditions relating to, or
material changes or restrictions in, the operation of any such assets or
businesses (or any part thereof); (3) take any action that would, or would be
reasonably likely to, materially impair the benefits reasonably expected to be
derived by Buyer, Seller, or any of their respective Affiliates from the
Transactions; or (4) take any action that would, or would be reasonably likely
to, impose any material cost or Liability on Buyer, Seller, or any of their
respective Affiliates (subclauses (1) through (4) being referred to as a
"Burdensome Condition"). In connection with resolving any issues raised by or
concerns of Government Entities in connection with the actions addressed in
this Section 4.4, neither Party will obligate itself or any of its Affiliates,
without each other Party's prior written consent (which may be withheld in
such Party's sole discretion), to undertake any actions that would constitute
or give rise to, or reasonably could be expected to constitute or give rise
to, a Burdensome Condition.

(d) Each Party will promptly notify the others in writing of any pending or,
to the Knowledge of such Party, threatened in writing action, Proceeding, or
investigation by any Government Entity or any other Person (i) challenging or
seeking damages in connection with the Transactions or (ii) seeking to
restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Transactions.

4.5 Access. During the Executory Period, Seller shall afford Buyer and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice, and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with
the normal business operations of Seller to (a) the assets, books and records,
employees, and properties of the Business and (b) such additional information
relating to the Business, Acquired Assets, or Assumed Liabilities as Buyer may
from time to time reasonably request.

4.6 Assignment and Novation of Business Contracts.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement
does not constitute an agreement to transfer (by novation, assignment, or
delegation) any Business Contract, or any claim, right, benefit, or obligation
thereunder, if an attempted transfer thereof is not permitted or is not
permitted without the consent of a Government Entity or Third Party, as
applicable (each an "Unassignable Contract"). This Agreement shall not be
deemed to constitute an assignment of any such Unassignable Contract if such
consent is not given or if such assignment otherwise would constitute a breach
of, or cause a loss of contractual benefits under, any such Unassignable
Contract, and, except as contemplated by this Section 4.6, Buyer shall assume
no obligations or liabilities under any such Unassignable Contract. Seller
shall advise Buyer in writing at least two Business Days prior to the Closing
Date with respect to any Business Contract not otherwise disclosed on Schedule
2.2(b) to the Seller Disclosure Letter

05466425.6 32

* * *



that, to the Knowledge of Seller, will or may not be subject to assignment to
Buyer hereunder at the Closing.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
following provisions will apply with respect to each Unassignable Contract:

(i) Seller shall cooperate with Buyer following the Closing Date in a
reasonable arrangement designed to novate all rights and obligations of Seller
to Buyer so that Buyer is substituted for Seller under each Unassignable
Contract and Seller is relieved of all further Liabilities and rights
thereunder.

(ii) If, with respect to any such Unassignable Contract, such novation is not
obtained, or if an attempted novation, assignment, or delegation thereof would
be ineffective or would adversely affect the claims, benefits, rights, or
obligations of Buyer or Seller thereunder, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and the terms of such Unassignable Contract, effective as of
the Closing, (1) this Agreement will constitute a full and equitable
assignment and delegation to Buyer of all of Seller's benefits, Liabilities,
obligations thereunder and right, title and interest thereto, and Buyer will
be deemed Seller's agent for the purpose of completing, fulfilling, and
discharging all of Seller's Liabilities and obligations thereunder; (2) Seller
shall take all necessary steps and actions to provide Buyer with the benefits
of each Unassignable Contract and to relieve Seller of the performance of all
Liabilities and obligations thereunder; and (3) if requested by Buyer, Seller
shall act as an agent on behalf of Buyer or as Buyer shall otherwise
reasonably require.

(c) Upon Buyer's request, the Parties agree to use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to cause each Unassignable Contract to be assigned to Buyer in
accordance with the terms thereof promptly following the Closing; provided
that Seller shall not be required to incur any additional out-of-pocket costs
or expenses in connection therewith.

4.7 Tax Matters.

(a) As between the Parties, (i) Seller shall be responsible for and pay all
real property Taxes, personal property Taxes, and similar ad valorem
obligations, if any, including special assessments with respect to such Taxes,
levied or imposed upon, or in connection with, the Acquired Assets or the
conduct or operation of the Business with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period; (ii) Buyer shall be responsible for and pay all real property Taxes,
personal property Taxes, and similar ad valorem obligations, if any, including
special assessments with respect to such Taxes, levied or imposed upon, or in
connection with, the Acquired Assets or the conduct or the operation of the
Business with respect to any taxable period or portion thereof beginning after
the Closing Date; and (iii) each Party will be responsible for its own income
Taxes. All such real property Taxes, personal property Taxes, and similar ad
valorem obligations levied with respect to the Acquired Assets or the Business
for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date will
be apportioned between Seller and Buyer based on the number of days included
in such period through and including the Closing Date and the number of days
included in such period after the Closing Date.

05466425.6 33

* * *



(b) Seller and Buyer will provide each other with such assistance and non-
privileged information relating to the Business and the Acquired Assets as may
reasonably be requested in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return
relating to the Business or the Acquired Assets or the performance of any
Proceeding by any Taxing Authority relating to any such Tax Return, whether
conducted in a judicial or administrative forum, and, to the extent in such
Party's possession as of the date of this Agreement, each will retain and
provide to the other Party all non-privileged records and other information
that may be relevant to any such Tax Return or Proceeding relating to Taxes.

(c) Seller and Buyer will each be responsible for paying 50% of all transfer,
documentary, sales and use, registration, value-added, stamp, or other similar
Taxes, if any, arising out of or in connection with the Transactions
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), and Seller shall prepare and file all Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to such Transfer Taxes on a
timely basis as may be required to comply with the provisions of applicable
Tax Laws; provided that Buyer shall provide to Seller any certificates or
other documents that Seller may reasonably request to minimize Seller's actual
or potential liability for such Transfer Taxes.

(d) Within 60 days after the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a proposed
allocation for income Tax purposes of the Purchase Price and the Assumed
Liabilities (together with any other items properly treated as purchase price
for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) between the Acquired Assets (the
"Initial Allocation") for Buyer's review and comment. Such allocation must
comply with the requirements of Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder. If, prior to the end of the Review Period, Buyer has
not delivered to Seller a Notice of Disagreement with respect to the Initial
Allocation, the Initial Allocation will be final and binding on the Parties
and will be deemed the Final Allocation. If, prior to the end of the Review
Period, Buyer has delivered to Seller a Notice of Disagreement with respect to
the Initial Allocation, then (i) during the Resolution Period, Buyer and
Seller shall seek in good faith to resolve any Disputed Items; and (ii) all
items included in the Initial Allocation that Buyer does not include in such
Notice of Disagreement will be final and binding on the Parties. During such
Resolution Period, each Party shall provide the other Party and its
Representatives with reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, to the books, records, and other materials that such other
Party reasonably requests relating to such Notice of Disagreement and such
Disputed Items. If, at the end of the Resolution Period, Buyer and Seller have
not resolved each Disputed Item with respect to the Initial Allocation, then
any remaining Disputed Items will be submitted to the Independent Accounting
Firm for resolution in a manner consistent, mutatis mutandis, with the review
and Disputed Items procedures set forth in Section 1.3(d). Each Party shall
report the Transactions for income Tax purposes in a manner consistent with
the Final Allocation and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith on
any Tax Return or before any Government Entity unless otherwise required by "a
determination" within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code (or any similar
provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Law).

4.8 Employee Matters.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date and effective as of and contingent upon the
Closing, Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall make offers of employment to
(and Seller and its Affiliates shall terminate the employment of) all of the
employees of the Business set forth on Schedule 4.8(a) to the Seller
Disclosure Letter (the "Business Employees") who are actively at work as of
the Closing Date; provided that Seller shall have the right to review and
provide comments on any such communications to the Business Employees.

(b) Effective immediately following the Closing, Buyer or an Affiliate of
Buyer shall employ each Business Employee who (i) prior to the Closing Date
has accepted in writing an offer of employment and has executed and delivered
to Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer such other agreements or documents that
Buyer reasonably requires, (ii) continues to be an employee of a Seller or any
of its Affiliates as of immediately prior to the Closing, and (iii) agrees to
become an employee of Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer effective as of the
Closing. Business Employees who accept such offers of employment from Buyer
are referred to herein as "Continuing Employees." In the event any Business
Employee who is not actively at work as of the Closing Date becomes available
for and able to return to active work within 90 days following the Closing
Date, Buyer or its Affiliate shall offer employment to (and Seller and its
Affiliates shall terminate) such Business Employee effective upon the date
such Business Employee is available for and able to return to active work.
Such offer by Buyer or its Affiliate will be on the terms set forth in this
Section 4.8. Nothing contained in this Section 4.8 will in any way limit
Buyer's or any of its Affiliates' ability to terminate the employment of any
Continuing Employee for any or no reason and neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates is in any way obligated to continue the employment of any such
Continuing Employee for any specific period.

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 1.1(d), Buyer and its
Affiliates will have no obligations or other Liabilities under this Agreement
with respect to any Person who elects not to become a Continuing Employee in
accordance with Section 4.8(b) or Section 4.8(c) (any such employee, a "Non-
Continuing Employee"). Seller will be exclusively responsible for all
Liabilities arising from Seller's employment of any such Non-Continuing
Employee or Seller's termination of such employment (including any severance
and other similar costs), and all such Liabilities will constitute Excluded
Liabilities under this Agreement.

(d) For a period of 12 months following the Closing Date (or until the
termination of employment of the relevant Continuing Employee if sooner),
Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall provide or cause to be provided to all
Continuing Employees (i) a rate of base salary or hourly rate, wages, non-
equity based bonus opportunity, and other cash compensation no less favorable
in total than the rate of base salary, wages, non-equity bonus opportunity,
and other cash compensation paid by Seller and their Affiliates to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) other
employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
benefits provided Buyer's or its Subsidiaries' similarly situated employees as
of immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided that nothing in this
Section 4.8(d) will prohibit Buyer or any of its Affiliates from implementing
across-the-board reductions in salary, wages, bonuses, cash compensation, and
employee benefits to its employees

05466425.6 35

* * *



so long as such reductions do not disproportionately affect the Continuing
Employees relative to other similarly situated employees of Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries.

(e) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries in which any Continuing Employees will participate effective
as of the Closing or thereafter, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, recognize all service of the Continuing Employees with Seller prior to the
Closing as if such service were with Buyer or such Subsidiary for purposes of
vesting, eligibility, and level of benefits (but not for purposes of benefit
accrual under any Tax-qualified defined benefit plan or for any purpose under
any equity-based, nonqualified deferred compensation or retiree welfare plan
or arrangement) in each such plan; provided that such service will only be
recognized to the same extent and for the same purpose as recognized by Seller
under a comparable Employee Plan of Seller prior to the Closing and will not
be recognized to the extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits
or compensation. Following the Closing Date, for the plan year in which the
Closing occurs Buyer shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to (i) ensure,
or cause to ensure subject to contract and plan provisions, that no
limitations or exclusions as for pre-existing conditions, evidence of
insurability or good health, waiting periods, or actively-at-work exclusions
or other limitations or restrictions on coverage are applicable to any
Continuing Employees or their dependents or beneficiaries under any health
benefit plans in which such Continuing Employees or their dependents or
beneficiaries may be eligible to participate to the same extent not applicable
under a comparable Seller Employee Plan and (ii) provide or cause to be
provided that eligible in-network medical expenses incurred by Continuing
Employees (and their dependents or beneficiaries) up to (and including) the
Closing Date will be taken into account for purposes of satisfying the
applicable deductible for such health plan.

(f) Buyer shall cause its or its Subsidiary's 401(k) plan or Tax-qualified
defined contribution plan to permit the Continuing Employees to make rollover
contributions to such plan of amounts distributable to such Continuing
Employees from Seller's 401(k) Plan that are eligible rollover distributions
as defined in Section 402(c) of the Code (in cash, but including any
promissory notes reflecting participant loans to Continuing Employees from the
Seller's 401(k) Plan).

(g) Effective as of the Closing, Seller shall cause all Continuing Employees
who participate in the Seller 401(k) Plan to be fully vested in their account
balances thereunder, and Seller shall make all employer contributions that
would have been made on behalf of such Continuing Employees had the
Transactions not occurred, regardless of any service or end of year employment
requirements but prorated for the portion of the plan year that ends on the
Closing Date. Seller will be solely responsible for complying with the
requirements of Section 4980B of the Code with respect to any "MandA qualified
beneficiary" as that term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section
54.4980B-9.

(h) Buyer shall have no obligation to assume the accrued but unused paid time
off of any Business Employee who is employed outside the State of California.
With respect to Business Employees employed in the State of California, Seller
shall require each Business Employee to elect whether such employee desires to
have his or her accrued but unused paid

05466425.6 36

* * *



time off paid out upon Closing by Seller or transferred to Buyer or its
Affiliates (the "PTO Elections"). Not later than the 10 days prior to the
Closing Date (the "Election Deadline"), Seller will provide Buyer with a list
of all responses to the PTO Elections. For those Business Employees employed
in the State of California who (a) become Continuing Employees and (b) elect
in writing for accrued but unused paid time off to be transferred to Buyer or
its Affiliates, Buyer will assume such amounts. Within the time frame required
by applicable Law, Seller shall pay all accrued but unused paid time off to
each Business Employee employed in the State of California who either (i) does
not become a Continuing Employee, (ii) elects in writing by the Election
Deadline for such employee's accrued but unused paid time off to be paid out
by Seller on the Closing Date, or (iii) fails to respond in writing to the PTO
Election by the Election Deadline.

(i) For the 90 days following the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates not to, take any action with regard to the Continuing Employees
that may, alone or in combination with any conduct of Seller occurring prior
to the Closing, cause Seller to incur any Liability under the WARN Act or any
equivalent state or local Laws.

(j) During the Interim Period, Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to make natural Persons engaged by Seller as independent contractors
available to Buyer for the purpose of allowing Buyer to interview each such
contractor for the purposes of determining the nature and extent of each such
Person's continuation with Buyer, if any. During the Interim Period, Seller
shall provide to Buyer contact information for third-party service providers
providing contingent personnel to the Business and reasonably cooperate in
identifying such contingent work force to the extent reasonably requested by
Buyer.

(k) The provisions of this Section 4.8 are solely for the benefit of the
Parties and shall not be construed to confer any benefits or rights or
remedies (including any third party beneficiary rights) on any other Person.
No provision of this Agreement will be construed to (i) establish, amend,
modify, or terminate or limit the ability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to
amend, modify, or terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program,
contract, policy, agreement, or arrangement, or (ii) confer on any Person any
right to employment or service or any particular term or condition of
employment or service with Buyer or any of its Affiliates, or limit the
ability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to terminate the employment or
service of any Person at any time and for any or no reason.

4.9 Confidentiality. For two years following the Closing Date, Seller shall,
and shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause its Affiliates to, hold
in confidence and not disclose to any Person other than Seller's legal, Tax,
accounting, banking, or other professional advisers, any Confidential
Information. If Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives are
compelled to disclose any Confidential Information by judicial or
administrative Proceeding (but specifically excluding any disclosure required
by applicable Law), Seller shall notify Buyer and shall disclose only that
portion of such Confidential Information that Seller is advised by its counsel
(including in-house counsel) is legally required to be disclosed. Seller shall
cooperate with Buyer, at Buyer's sole expense, to obtain an appropriate
protective Order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded such Confidential Information.

05466425.6 37

* * *



The provisions of this Section 4.9 will not apply to any information or data
used exclusively in the operation of the Excluded Assets or relating to the
Excluded Liabilities.

4.10 Public Announcements. Each Party will not, and will cause its Affiliates
and its Representatives not to, issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other public announcement with respect to the economic or other
material terms of the Transactions without the prior written consent of the
other Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned); provided that a Party may, without the prior written consent of
the other Party, issue or cause publication of any such press release or
public announcement or filing with the SEC to the extent that such Party
reasonably determines, after consultation with legal counsel, such action is
required by applicable Law, including the rules and regulations of the SEC, or
pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national securities
exchange or interdealer quotation service, in which event such Party will use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to allow the other Parties reasonable time to
comment on such press release, public announcement or SEC filing in advance of
its issuance, publication, or filing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Parties shall work together in good faith to issue, individually or
collectively, in connection with the execution of this Agreement a press
release or releases announcing the Transactions and the anticipated go-forward
relationship of the Parties thereafter as contemplated by this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents (including the announcement of the same to
investors in, and discussion regarding the same with analysts of, any
publicly-traded Affiliate of Seller).

4.11 Debt Financing.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
Buyer will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to (i) negotiate definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment or on such other terms and
conditions that would not reasonably be expected to delay the Closing in any
material respect or reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to an
amount that, when taken together with Parent's cash on hand, would not be
sufficient to make the Required Payments at Closing; (ii) satisfy on a timely
basis all conditions set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment applicable to
Parent or Buyer that are within its control; and (iii) enforce its rights
under the Debt Financing Commitment in the event of any breach or threatened
breach thereof.

(b) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment, each of Parent and
Buyer will, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event,
use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to arrange alternative financing from
alternative sources on terms and conditions that would not reasonably be
expected to delay the Closing in any material respect or reduce the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing to an amount that, when taken together with
Parent's cash on hand, would not be sufficient to make the Required Payments
at Closing; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, completing the Debt
Financing is not a condition to Closing. To the extent Parent and Buyer obtain
alternative financing pursuant to this Section 4.11(b), references

05466425.6 38

* * *



to the Debt Financing, the Debt Financing Commitment, and the Debt Financing
Sources (and other like terms in this Agreement) will be deemed to refer to
such alternative financing.

(c) To the extent reasonably requested from time to time by Seller, Parent and
Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed of the status of Parent's efforts
to obtain the Debt Financing and to satisfy the conditions thereof, including
advising and updating Seller, in a reasonable level of detail, with respect to
status, proposed closing date, and material terms of the definitive
documentation related to the Debt Financing. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent and Buyer will give Seller prompt notice of (i) any breach by any party
to the Debt Financing Commitment that Buyer or Parent becomes aware of that
would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in Parent being unable to
obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in the Debt Financing Commitment or that would reasonably be expected to delay
the Closing in any material respect or (ii) any repudiation, cancellation, or
termination of the Debt Financing Commitment by any party to the Debt
Financing Commitment.

4.12 Debt Financing Cooperation.

(a) Prior to Closing and subject in all respects to Section 4.12(b), Seller
will, and will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause its
Representatives to, provide to Parent and Buyer, in each case at the sole cost
and expense of Parent and Buyer, upon reasonable notice and on a timely basis,
such cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Parent, Buyer, or the Debt
Financing Sources to assist Buyer and Parent in causing the conditions
described in the Debt Financing Commitment that relate to any information
about Seller, the Business, or the Acquired Assets with respect to pre-Closing
periods to be satisfied and all other commercially reasonable cooperation as
is reasonably necessary or requested by Parent, Buyer, or the Debt Financing
Sources in connection with obtaining, arranging, and consummating the Debt
Financing in accordance with its terms, including cooperation that consists
of:

(i) providing Parent and Buyer as promptly as reasonably practicable with such
readily available financial and other information regarding the Business and
Acquired Assets as may be necessary in connection with any Debt Financing or
as otherwise reasonably requested by Parent or Buyer in connection therewith,
including furnishing Parent, Buyer, and the sources of the Debt Financing with
the financial information set forth in Exhibit C of the Debt Financing
Commitment;

(ii) furnishing Parent and Buyer promptly with all documentation and other
information as reasonably requested by Parent or Buyer within five Business
Days following written request therefor from Parent or Buyer in connection
with such Debt Financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations;

(iii) making appropriate officers and members of senior management of Seller
available to (1) participate in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, due diligence sessions, and sessions with prospective lenders
in connection with the Debt Financing; and (2) assist with the preparation of
materials for bank information memoranda and similar documents required in
connection with the arranging, obtaining, and consummation of the Debt

05466425.6 39

Financing, which includes the consent to the reasonable use of Seller's logos
in connection with the Debt Financing (and will, upon request of Buyer,
provide Buyer with electronic versions of such logos for such use); and

(iv) assisting Parent and Buyer in connection with the preparation and
registration of any pledge and security documents, supplemental indentures,
currency or interest hedging arrangements, and other definitive financing
agreements or documents (including any related schedules, annexes, and
exhibits thereto) as may be reasonably requested by Parent, Buyer, or the Debt
Financing Sources, and otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of
collateral and the granting of security interests in the Acquired Assets with
respect to the Debt Financing, it being understood that such documents will
not be recorded or take effect until the Closing.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this
Agreement, (i) neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives
will be required to execute or enter into any certificate, instrument,
Contract, or other document in connection with the Financing, including any
solvency certificate in each case, that is not contingent upon Closing; (ii)
nothing herein will require cooperation or other actions or efforts on the
part of Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives in connection with
the Financing to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of Seller or its Affiliates; (iii) neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates or Representatives will be required to pay any commitment or other
similar fee, to incur any other Liability, or to enter into any Contract or
other instrument or document (including grants of security interests or
pledging of collateral) in connection with the Debt Financing that is not
contingent upon Closing; and (iv) nothing herein will require Seller or any of
its Affiliates or Representatives to adopt resolutions approving or otherwise
approve or execute the Contracts, documents, or instruments pursuant to which
the Debt Financing is made.

(c) Prior to the Closing, Buyer and Parent shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to (and use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause
their respective Representatives to), hold in confidence and not disclose to
any Person other than their respective legal, Tax, accounting, banking, or
other professional advisers and the Debt Financing Sources or any Debt
Financing Sources Related Parties, any information furnished to or obtained by
Parent, Buyer, or the sources of the Financing pursuant to this Section 4.12
(excluding any such information that otherwise is or becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Parent, Buyer,
or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives in violation of this
Section 4.12). If either Buyer, Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates
or Representatives are compelled to disclose any such information by judicial
or administrative Proceeding (but specifically excluding any disclosure
required by applicable Law), Buyer and Parent shall notify Buyer and shall
disclose only that portion of such information that Buyer or Parent is advised
by its counsel (including in-house counsel) is legally required to be
disclosed. Buyer and Parent shall cooperate with Seller, at Seller's sole
expense, to obtain an appropriate protective Order or other reasonable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such information.

05466425.6 40

* * *



(d) Promptly upon termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1 (other
than pursuant to Section 6.1(c)) and notwithstanding Section 8.1, Buyer and
Parent will reimburse Seller for any and all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by any of them in
connection with their obligations pursuant to this Section 4.12; provided that
Seller, and not Parent and Buyer, will be responsible for (i) fees payable to
existing legal, financial, or other advisors of Seller and its Representatives
with respect to services provided on or prior to the Closing, (ii) any
ordinary course amounts payable to existing employees of or consultants or
advisors to Seller with respect to services provided on or prior to the
Closing, and (iii) any amounts that would have been incurred in connection
with the Transactions regardless of the Debt Financing (including the
preparation, execution, and delivery of financial information and the Lien

with any of the Acquired Assets within 60 days after the Closing, including by
removing any Seller Names and Marks displayed on any pre-printed stationery,
business cards, purchase orders, invoices, and other similar correspondence,
and all printed and online materials used or held for use following the

respect to any new Business Contracts that are entered into by and between the
Company and party during such time (each a "Schedule Supplement"), provided
that, such new Business Contracts shall be entered into in accordance with
Section 4.1. The disclosures in any Schedule Supplement will not be deemed to
have cured any inaccuracy or breach in any representation or warranty
contained in Article II, including for purposes of indemnification or
termination rights contained in this Agreement; provided that, notwithstanding
Buyer's or Parent's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Article VI, if Buyer and Parent elect to close the Transactions, the accuracy
of the representations and warranties will be assessed as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing with reference to any Schedule Supplement as
though such Schedule Supplement had been included in the Seller Disclosure
Letter originally delivered on the date hereof.

consent of Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

photocopies or electronic copies at Seller's expense) during normal business
hours to such Business Records to enable Seller or its Affiliate Priority
Technology Holdings, Inc. to prepare financial statements, respond to any
proceeding or inquiry by a Government Entity, or otherwise comply with
applicable Law. The Parties shall reasonably cooperate, to the extent
requested by the other Party and at such other Party's expense, in connection

other disclosures that may be required to be included in any registration
statement or report filed by the other Party under federal securities Laws

the records and information are reasonably relevant to any such audited
financial statements and related financial and other disclosures and (b)
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis during normal
business hours to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Party will
be required to (i) take any action that would reasonably be expected to result

Person in connection with the operation of any Restricted Business in the
Restricted Area, or, subject to Section 4.17(b), acquire any interest in any
Person who engages in any Restricted Business in the Restricted Area; or

(ii) solicit, entice, encourage, or influence any employee of Buyer, Parent,

such employee to perform services other than for the benefit of Buyer, Parent,
or their respective Affiliates; provided that nothing in this Section
4.17(a)(ii) will prohibit Seller or any of its Affiliates from (A) conducting
general public solicitations, including through Third Party recruiting
services, not specifically targeting such employees or (B) hiring or
contracting with any employee who was primarily engaged in the Business and
whose employment was terminated (x) by such employee more than three months

jurisdiction;

(ii) it is the desire and intent of the Parties that the Restrictive Covenants
be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the Laws, Orders, and
public policies applied in each jurisdiction where enforcement is sought, and,
if any Restrictive Covenant is finally adjudicated to be invalid or
unenforceable, such Restrictive Covenant will be deemed amended to the extent
necessary so that (1) such provision is valid and enforceable, (2) the
remainder of such Restrictive Covenant is not affected and is given full
effect without regard to any invalid portions, and (3) such amendment applies
only with respect to the operation of the Restrictive Covenant in the
particular jurisdiction where such adjudication is made; and

(iii) the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Restrictive Covenants are
necessary for the protection and preservation of the value and the goodwill of
Buyer's and its Affiliates' businesses, including the Business, and legitimate
business interests and are (1) reasonable and valid in geographical and
temporal scope and in all other respects, (2) not overly broad or unduly
burdensome, and (3) are given by Seller in consideration of the Purchase

be reasonably anticipated to harm the reputation or business of, Seller.
Nothing in this Section 4.19(b) shall limit Buyer, Parent, or their respective
controlled Affiliates from making truthful statements or communications
pursuant to any Proceeding or as otherwise may be required by applicable Law.

(b) by any Party upon written notice to the other Parties, if:

(i) the Closing has not occurred within 90 days of the date of this Agreement,

(b) Seller will not be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons in

the other Transaction Document exceed the Purchase Price.

7.5 Other Limitations.

(a) Other than in the case of Fraud, the remedies provided in this Article

exclusive remedies of the Buyer Indemnified Persons and the Seller Indemnified
Persons with respect to any and all claims resulting from, relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents, or the
Transactions (except for any other remedies expressly set forth in Section
1.3, Section 4.17, and Section 8.9 and subject to any additional limitations
or remedies as may otherwise be set forth in the Services Agreement, in each
case, with respect to matters resulting from or arising out of the Services
Agreement, as applicable). Subject to the foregoing, no Party will have any
other rights or remedies in connection with any breach of this Agreement or
any other claim arising out of the negotiation, entry into, or consummation of
the Transactions for the recovery of Losses resulting from, relating to, or
arising out of this Agreement.

(b) For the purpose of (i) determining whether an inaccuracy exists or a
breach has occurred with respect to a representation or warranty contained in
Article II or Article III (other than with respect to Section 2.7(a)) and (ii)
calculating the amount of Losses with respect to any inaccuracy in or breach
of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, any
materiality, Material Adverse Effect, or similar qualification in such
representations and warranties will be disregarded.

to use, Commercially Reasonable Efforts to mitigate any Losses that form the
basis of any claim for indemnification by such Indemnified Party under this
Article VII.

(d) In no event will any Indemnifying Party be responsible or liable for any
Loss or other amounts under this Article VII representing exemplary damages or
punitive damages, except to the extent such Losses are paid or payable with
respect to a Third-Party Claim.

7.6 Manner of Payment; Insurance.

(a) Any indemnification owing by Seller (i) pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i)
(other than with respect to any Fundamental Representation and the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.6 (Tax Matters)) for
Losses in excess of the Buyer Retention Amount will be paid (1) first from the
Escrow Amount up to the Initial Cap and (2) thereafter from the RandW Insurance
Policy, or (ii) pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) (solely with respect to any
Fundamental Representation and the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 2.6 (Tax Matters)), Section 7.2(a)(ii), or Section 7.2(a)(iii) will be
paid by Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
or accounts designated by the applicable Buyer

05466425.6 49

* * *



Indemnified Person within 10 Business Days after the final determination of
the amount of such Losses thereof.

(b) Any indemnification owing by Buyer or Parent pursuant to this Article VII
will be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or
accounts designated by the applicable Seller Indemnified Person within 10
Business Days after the final determination of the amount of such Losses
thereof.

(c) The amount of any Losses subject to indemnification by a Indemnifying
Party hereunder will be net of any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party
under insurance policies, other sources of indemnification, or otherwise with
respect to such Losses (net of documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with such recovery).

(d) Following the Closing, and without affecting the Indemnified Party's
rights to indemnification hereunder (unless proceeds are actually recovered),
the Indemnified Party shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to pursue any
available claims under applicable insurance policies (including the RandW
Insurance Policy); provided that in no event will any Indemnified Party be
required to seek recovery under such insurance policies prior to submitting a
claim for indemnification in accordance with this Article VII. In the event an
Indemnified Party receives any recovery from insurers or otherwise with
respect to such Losses after an Indemnifying Party has made a payment in
respect of such Losses, the Indemnified Party shall refund to the Indemnifying
Party the amount actually received by it (net of any expenses incurred by such
Person in collecting such amounts).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article VII, with respect
to all claims for Losses made pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) (other than with
respect to any Fundamental Representation and the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 2.6 (Tax Matters)), to the extent that the
procedures in this Article VII are inconsistent with the procedures in the RandW
Insurance Policy with regard to matters such as notice, control, settlement,
or defense of claims, the procedures in the RandW Insurance Policy will control;
provided that this Section 7.6(e) does not relieve any Indemnified Party from
any obligations under this Article VII to give notice of a claim to the
Indemnifying Party.

7.7 Third Party Claims. If any Proceeding is initiated by any Third Party (any
such Proceeding, a "Third Party Claim") against any Person entitled to seek
indemnification under this Article VII (an "Indemnified Party"), and if such
Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnification with respect thereto under
this Article VII, such Indemnified Party shall promptly, after receipt of
written notice of such Proceeding, provide written notice of such Proceeding
to the Party or Parties from whom the Indemnified Party intends to seek
indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party"), which notice must describe such
Proceeding in reasonable detail and the amount claimed in respect thereof (if
known and quantifiable); provided that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
hereunder unless and to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by
such failure to so notify. The Indemnifying Party will be entitled to
participate in the defense of such Proceeding giving rise to an Indemnified
Party's claim for indemnification at the Indemnifying Party's expense, and, at
its option but subject to the limitations set forth below,

05466425.6 50

* * *



will be entitled to assume control of the defense thereof through counsel of
its choosing in connection with such defense within 30 days of its receipt of
notice of the Proceeding; provided that:

(a) the Indemnified Party will be entitled to participate (at its sole cost)
in the defense of such claim through counsel of its choosing, provided that
the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the
Indemnified Party;

(b) the Indemnifying Party will not be entitled to assume control of such
defense if (i) in the written opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, a
conflict of interest exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party with regard to the Third Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails
to acknowledge in writing its indemnification obligation with respect to such
Third Party Claim, or (iii) such Third Party Claim is related to Taxes; and

(c) if the Indemnifying Party elects control the defense of any such claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party before ceasing to defend such claim or entering into any
settlement of a Proceeding unless the settlement involves only payment of
money damages, all such money damages will be the responsibility of, and paid
by, the Indemnifying Party, the settlement does not impose any injunctive or
other equitable relief, and the settlement unconditionally releases the
Indemnified Party from all Liabilities with respect to such claim.

7.8 Direct Claims. Any claim by an Indemnified Party with respect to a claim
for indemnity under this Article VII that does not result from a claim by a
Third Party (a "Direct Claim") will be asserted by giving the Indemnifying
Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, stating the nature of such
claim in reasonable detail and the basis for indemnification (taking into
account the information then available to the Indemnified Party), and
asserting the amount, if known, or if not known, an estimate of the
foreseeable maximum amount of claimed Losses resulting from such claim (which
estimate will not be conclusive of the final amount of such Losses) (an
"Indemnity Notice"); provided that no such claim will be effective if the
Indemnity Notice was not delivered to the Indemnifying Party prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in Section 7.1. The
failure of the Indemnified Party to provide an Indemnity Notice to the
Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
hereunder unless and to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by
such failure to so notify. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified
Party within 60 days from its receipt of the Indemnity Notice that the
Indemnifying Party disputes such claim (the "Dispute Notice"), the claim will
be resolved as provided pursuant to Section 8.12, Section 8.13, and Section
8.14. If the Indemnifying Party does not timely deliver a Dispute Notice, or
delivers a Dispute Notice that does not object to all of the Losses set forth
in the Indemnity Notice, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have
accepted and agreed with all or such portion of the claim and will be
conclusively deemed to have consented to the recovery by the Indemnified Party
of all or such portion of the Losses specified in the Indemnity Notice.

7.9 Purchase Price Adjustment. All indemnification payments made under this
Article VII will constitute an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless (a) a

contained herein and rights, interests or obligations hereunder, by or on

05466425.6 52

* * *



Parties, will bind and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and
permitted assigns of Parties whether so expressed or not, except that neither

interests, or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated by Seller
prior to the Closing without the prior written consent of Buyer or by Buyer or

interpreted in such manner to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but
if any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to
any Person or circumstance is held to be prohibited by, illegal, or

prohibition, illegality, or unenforceability, without invalidating the

8.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (including by
means of facsimile or scanned and emailed signature pages or by other means of
electronic execution), any one of which need not contain the signatures of
more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute
one and the same agreement.

8.7 Descriptive Headings; Interpretation. The headings and captions used in
this Agreement and the table of contents to this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and will not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. The word "or" will not be exclusive. The word "extent" in the
phrase "to the extent" will mean to the degree to which a subject or other
thing extends, and such phrase will not mean simply "if". References to
"written" or "in writing" include electronic form. The words "hereof,"
"herein," and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this
Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole (including the Seller Disclosure
Letter and the Annexes and Exhibits hereto) and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement, and all Article, Section, Schedule, Annex, and
Exhibit references are to this Agreement unless otherwise specified. The words
"include," "includes," and "including" will be deemed to be followed by the
phrase "without limitation." Where this Agreement states that a Party "will,"
"shall," or "must" perform in some manner or otherwise act or omit to act, it
means that such Party is legally obligated to do so in accordance with this
Agreement. The meanings given to terms defined herein will be equally
applicable to both the singular and plural forms of such terms. Whenever the
context may require, any pronoun includes the corresponding masculine,
feminine, and neuter forms. All references to "dollars" or "$" will be deemed
references to the lawful money of the United States of America. Any reference
in this Agreement to a "day" or a number of "days" (without explicit reference
to "Business Day") will be deemed references to a calendar day or number of
calendar days. If any action is to be taken or given on or by a particular
calendar day, and such calendar day is not a

05466425.6 53

* * *



Business Day, then such action may be deferred until the next Business Day.
Any reference to a specific Law will include all amendments or restatements to
such Law as in effect from time to time and any rule or regulation promulgated
thereunder.

8.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
contain the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, whether written or oral, relating to such subject matter in
any way.

8.9 Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges that the Parties will be
irreparably harmed and that there will be no adequate remedy at law for any
violation by any Party of any of the covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to the terms of Section
4.17(c) and Section 7.5(a), in addition to any other remedies that may be
available upon the breach of any such covenants or agreements, each of the
Parties shall be entitled to equitable relief, without proof of actual
damages, including an injunction or injunctions or Orders for specific
performance to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to
which it is entitled at Law or in equity, as a remedy for any such breach or
threatened breach. Each Party further agrees that no Party or any other Person
will be required to obtain, furnish, or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
Section 8.9, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing, or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument. Subject to and without limiting the rights arising under Section
4.17(c) or Section 6.1, each Party further agrees that the only permitted
objection that it may raise in response to any action for equitable relief is
that it contests the existence of a breach or threatened breach of this
Agreement.

8.10 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except with respect to the Buyer
Indemnified Persons and the Seller Indemnified Persons, this Agreement is for
the sole benefit of the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns,
and nothing herein expressed or implied will give or be construed to give any
Person, other than the Parties and such permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable rights hereunder; provided that the Debt Financing Sources
Related Parties are express third party beneficiaries of Section 8.3, this
Section 8.10, and Section 8.17, and each of such Sections shall expressly
inure to the benefit of the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties and the
Debt Financing Sources Related Parties shall be entitled to rely on and
enforce the provisions of such Sections.

8.11 Schedules, Annexes, and Exhibits. The Seller Disclosure Letter and all
Annexes and Exhibits attached hereto or referred to herein are incorporated in
and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full herein.

8.12 Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of Laws
thereof.

05466425.6 54

* * *



8.13 Consent of Jurisdiction.

(a) Subject to Section 8.13(b), each of the Parties irrevocably consents,
agrees, and submits itself and its property to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Delaware Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the "Chosen Court"),
for the purpose of any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the Transactions, and each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that all
claims with respect to such Proceedings may be heard and determined
exclusively in the Chosen Court. Each of the Parties (a) consents to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Chosen Court in the event any
Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, (b) agrees that
it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any Chosen Court, (c) irrevocably consents to the
service of process in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions, on behalf of itself and its property, by U.S.
registered mail to such party's respective address set forth in Section 8.15,
and (d) agrees that it will not bring any Proceeding relating to this
Agreement and the Transactions in any court other than the Chosen Court. The
Parties agree that a final trial court judgment in any such Proceeding will be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law; provided that nothing in the foregoing
will restrict any Party's rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding,
or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment. This Section 8.13 will
not be construed as a waiver of any Party's right to seek enforcement of a
decision of the Chosen Court before any other courts, whether in the U.S. or
abroad.

(b) If, and only if, the Chosen Court would not have jurisdiction over all or
any portion of a Proceeding based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the Transactions (all or such portion of such Proceeding so
declined by the Chosen Court, an "Arbitration Action"), the Parties agree that
the Arbitration Action will be finally settled by binding arbitration in
accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. For
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 8.13(b) will prevent either Party
from seeking interim injunctive relief in the Chosen Court to prevent
irreparable injury pending appointment of the arbitrators pursuant to this
Section 8.13(b).

8.14 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each Party waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, any right it may have to trial by jury in respect of any
Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. Each Party
acknowledges that it and the other Parties have been induced to enter into
this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waiver in this Section 8.14.

8.15 Notices. All notices, demands, or other communications to be given or
delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement will be in
writing and will be deemed to have been given when delivered personally to the
recipient or when sent by email if delivery is confirmed by electronic
confirmation, three Business Days after being sent to recipient by U.S. First
