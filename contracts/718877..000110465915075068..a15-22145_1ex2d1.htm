(b) to reasonably co-operate and consult with AB in the preparation by AB or
AB Sub of the Takeover Offer Documents or any other document or filing which
is required for the purposes of implementing the Acquisition; and

 



 

(c) unless the King Board has effected a King Change of Recommendation
pursuant to Clause 5.2, to incorporate in the Rule 2.5 Announcement and the
Takeover Offer Documents a recommendation to the holders of King Shares from
the King Board to accept the Takeover Offer, and such recommendation shall not
be withdrawn, adversely modified or qualified except as contemplated by Clause
5.2.

 



 

3.6.4 If AB elects to implement the Acquisition by way of the Takeover Offer
in accordance with Clause 3.6.1, the Parties mutually agree:

 



 

(a) to prepare and file with, or submit to, the SEC and, to the extent
necessary, the Panel and the High Court, all documents, amendments and
supplements required to be filed therewith or submitted thereto pursuant to
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or otherwise by Law, and to make any
applications or initiate any appearances that may be required or desirable to
and in front of the High Court for the purpose of discontinuance of High Court
proceedings initiated in connection with the Scheme, and each Party shall have
reasonable opportunities to review and make comments on all such documents,
amendments and supplements and, following accommodation of such comments and

not yet vested and exercisable in accordance with the vesting provisions of
the EMI Option Agreement (" **Accelerated EMI Option Shares** "). The exercise
shall be by means of a

 



      
 

 



 

Cashless Option Exercise. The EMI Optionholder shall agree, by accepting the
Rule 15 Proposal, that if he ceases to be employed by the AB Group after the

the EMI Option Clawback Amount; and

 



 

4.2.2 in the event an EMI Optionholder does not accept the Rule 15 Proposal
described in Clause 4.2.1, the EMI Option shall lapse at the Effective Time in
accordance with the provisions of the EMI Option Agreement.

 



 

4.3 The Rule 15 Proposal to King Linked Optionholders shall provide as
follows:

 



 

4.3.1 to the extent that a King Linked Option will be vested and exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with its terms and
without regard to the Transactions (including the acceleration provided under

exercise immediately prior to the Effective Time and conditional on the Scheme
becoming effective. Such exercise shall be satisfied to the maximum extent
possible by the Release of King Linked Shares in accordance with the
provisions of the King Linked Option Agreement and the King Linked Option
shall lapse to the extent provided in such agreement (a " **Linked Share
Release** "). By accepting the Rule 15 Proposal, the King Linked Optionholder
shall direct that the King Linked Shares so Released be disposed of in the
Acquisition. To the extent the exercise of the King Linked Option will not be
satisfied by means of a Linked Share Release pursuant to this Clause 4.3.1 or
Clause 4.3.2, the King Linked Option shall be subject to the Rule 15 Proposal
to Optionholders described in Clause 4.4.1;

 



 

4.3.2 to the extent that a King Linked Option is not vested and exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with its terms and
without regard to the Transactions (including the acceleration provided for in
this Clause 4.3.2), the vesting of such King Linked Option shall accelerate
and it shall become exercisable in accordance with the provisions of the King
Linked Option Agreement immediately prior to the Effective Time and
conditional upon the Scheme becoming effective with respect to the lesser of
(i) the number of King Shares that would result in all of the King Linked
Shares being Released in a Linked Share Release, and (ii) all of the King
Shares subject to the King Linked Option (" **Accelerated Linked Options** ");
provided that if the King Linked Optionholder is a Good Reason Leaver within
the meaning of Clause 4.11, the number of Accelerated Linked Options shall be
the aggregate number of King Shares for which the King Linked Option would
have become exercisable (i) during the Transition Period applicable to such
Good Reason Leaver and (ii) on the Good Reason Leavers date of cessation of
employment with the AB Group (including any King Linked Options that would
have vested on an accelerated basis as of such date pursuant to the vesting
provisions of the King Award Agreement or the Good Reason Leavers Service
Agreement. The King Linked Optionholder shall complete a Linked Share Release
in respect of the Accelerated Linked Options and shall direct that the Linked
Shares Released pursuant to such exercise be disposed of in the Acquisition.
Any King Linked Shares that are not to be Released pursuant to the Linked
Share Release shall be transferred to King immediately prior to the
Cancellation Record Time for no consideration in accordance with the Articles
of Association of King and the King Award Agreement;

 



 

further, by accepting the Rule 15 Proposal, the King Linked Optionholder shall
agree that the Consideration in respect of the King Linked Shares Released
pursuant to this Clause 4.3.2, less the Tax Payment Amount, shall be deposited
in an escrow account held jointly by the King Linked Optionholder and AB. A
portion of the Consideration so deposited shall automatically be released from
the relevant escrow account to the King Linked Optionholder (i) within three
Business Days of each date after the Effective Time on which his Accelerated
Linked Options would have become exercisable in accordance with the vesting
provisions of the King Linked Option

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, on a pro-rata basis until depleted and, and (ii) subject to Clause
4.3.3, within five Business Days after the date the King Linked Optionholders
employment with the AB Group ceases, with respect to the portion of the
Consideration that is referable to the number of Accelerated Linked Options
for which the King Linked Option would have been vested and exercisable on
such cessation date, including any Accelerated Linked Options that would have
vested on an accelerated basis as of such date pursuant to the vesting
provisions of the King Award Agreement, and in each case on the basis that all
other conditions for exercise would have been deemed satisfied;

 



 

4.3.3 in the case of a King Linked Optionholder who is party to an AB
Executive Service Agreement, the entire balance remaining in the escrow
account described in Clause 4.3.2 on the date of cessation of the King Linked
Optionholders cessation of employment with AB shall automatically be released
to the King Linked Optionholder within five Business Days after such cessation
date, unless AB shall have delivered to the King Linked Optionholder a
certificate setting out the reasons why the circumstances of such cessation
constitute "Cause" as defined in his AB Executive Service Agreement or
otherwise do not entitle him to King Award Agreements Accelerated Vesting, as
defined in his AB Executive Service Agreement, and the King Linked
Optionholder has not notified AB within 10 Business Days after receiving such
notification that he does not accept such certificate, in which case such
remaining balance shall be paid to AB. To the extent that a King Linked
Optionholder has notified AB that he does not accept ABs certificate, the
remaining balance shall be held in escrow until a resolution of the dispute
over the King Linked Optionholders right to such balance is reached;

 



 

4.3.4 in the event that any payment due to a King Linked Optionholder is not
made in accordance with the provisions of Clause 4.3.3, and such default is
not cured within 10 Business Days of notice of such default being served by
the King Linked Optionholder, such default shall constitute a breach by AB of
the terms of the King Linked Optionholders service agreement with the AB
Group (the " **Escrow Payment Terms** ");

 



 

4.3.5 to the extent that a King Linked Option is accelerated only in part
pursuant to Clause 4.3.2, it shall be subject to the Rule 15 Proposal to
Optionholders as set out in Clause 4.4, and on the basis that the Accelerated
Linked Options would have been the first to vest and become exercisable after
the Effective Time, such that the King Linked Option shall not become vested
and exercisable for any additional King Shares until after the date on which
all Accelerated Linked Options would have become vested and exercisable in
accordance with the vesting provisions of the King Linked Option; and

 



 

4.3.6 if a King Linked Optionholder does not accept the Rule 15 Proposal for a
Linked Share Release as set out in Clauses 4.3.1 through 4.3.3, inclusive, and
the King Linked Option is not subject to the Rule 15 Proposal to Optionholders
as set out in Clauses 4.4.1 or 4.4.2, the King Linked Option subject to such
proposal shall lapse at the Effective Time and the King Linked Shares that
would have been Released in connection with such Linked Share Release shall be
transferred to King immediately prior to the Cancellation Record Time for no
consideration in accordance with the Articles of Association of King and the
King Award Agreement.

Performance Optionholders, the holder of the King Under-water Option and King
Non-Executive Directors, and subject to the provisions of Clause 4.3 in
respect of King Linked Options, shall provide as follows:

extent a King Option is vested and exercisable as of immediately prior to the

immediately prior to the Effective Time through a Cashless Option Exercise;

 



 

4.4.2 each King Option subject to this Clause 4 that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, save to

King Option as set forth in Clause 4.4.1, shall, as of the Effective Time,
subject to the consent of the Optionholder to the extent required pursuant to
the King Award Agreement, be assumed and converted into an option (an "
**Assumed Share Option** ") to acquire the number of AB Shares (rounded down
to the nearest whole share) that is equal to the product of (i) the number of
King Shares subject to such King Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the Consideration by (B)
the average closing price per AB Share on the NASDAQ Stock Market ("
**NASDAQ** ") for the five trading day period ending on the trading day
preceding the Effective Date or, if AB Shares were not available for trading
on NASDAQ on the day preceding the Effective Date, on the last day prior to
the day preceding the Effective Date that AB Shares were available for trading
on NASDAQ (the " **Exchange Ratio** "). The Assumed Share Option shall have an
exercise price per AB Share equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per King Share of such
King Option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date by (y) the
Exchange Ratio. The remaining term, vesting schedule and all of the other
terms of each Assumed Share Option shall otherwise be on the terms of the King
Award Agreement for the King Option save, in the case of King Options held by
an Optionholder who is party to an AB Executive Service Agreement, to the
extent varied by such agreement; and

Agreement.

 



 

4.5 The Rule 15 Proposal to King Performance Optionholders shall provide as
follows:

King Shares subject to the King Performance Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) the Exchange Ratio. The Assumed Performance Option
shall have an exercise price per AB Share equal to the quotient (rounded up to
the nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per King
Share of the King Performance Option in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Date by (y) the Exchange Ratio. The terms of each Assumed
Performance Option shall be the terms of the King Award Agreement for the King
Performance Option save to the extent varied by the King Performance
Optionholders AB Executive Service Agreement; and

 



 

4.5.2 if a King Performance Optionholder does not accept the Rule 15 Proposal
described in Clause 4.5.1, his King Performance Option shall lapse at the

nearest whole share) that is equal to the product of (i) the number of King
Shares subject to the King Under-water Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) the Exchange Ratio. The Assumed Under-water Option

for no consideration in accordance with the Articles of Association of King
and the King Award Agreement.

 



 

4.7 The Rule 15 Proposal to Restricted Share Award Holders, other than the

Award Holder has not notified AB within 10 Business Days after receiving such
notification that he does not accept such certificate, in which case such
remaining balance shall be paid to AB. To the extent that a Restricted Share
Award Holder has notified AB that he does not accept ABs certificate, the
remaining balance shall be held in escrow until a resolution of the dispute
over the Restricted Share Award Holders right to such balance is reached;

 



 

4.7.3 payment of the funds held in the escrow account described in Clause
4.7.2 shall be subject to the Escrow Payment Terms as described in Clause
4.3.4; and

 



 

4.7.4 to the extent that King Shares comprised in a King Restricted Share
Award will not vest pursuant to the Rule 15 Proposal described in Clause
4.7.1, they shall be transferred to King immediately prior to the Cancellation
Record Time for no consideration in accordance with the Articles of
Association of King and the King Award Agreement.

 



 

4.8 The Rule 15 Proposal to RSU Award Holders, other than the King Non-
Executive Directors, shall provide as follows:

 



 

4.8.1 each King RSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, subject to the consent of the RSU Award Holder, to the
extent required pursuant to the RSU Award Agreement, as of the Effective Time
be assumed and converted into a restricted stock unit award (an " **Assumed
RSU Award** ") with respect to the number of AB Shares (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) that is equal to the product of (i) the number of King
Shares subject to such King RSU Award and (ii) the Exchange Ratio. The vesting
schedule and all of the other terms of each Assumed RSU Award shall otherwise
be on the terms of the King Award Agreement for the King RSU Award save, in
the case of King RSU Awards held by an RSU Award Holder who is party to an AB
Executive Service Agreement, to the extent varied by such agreement; and

 



 

4.8.2 each King RSU Award that is not to be so assumed and converted shall
lapse at the Effective Time in accordance with the provisions of the King 2014
Plan.

 



 

4.9 The Rule 15 Proposal to King Non-Executive Directors shall provide as
follows:

 



 

4.9.1 each King RSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and is held by a King Non-Executive Director shall, in
accordance with the terms of the King Award Agreement, accelerate and become
fully vested immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be settled by
the issuance of the applicable number of King Shares to the King Non-Executive
Director immediately prior to the Effective Time;

 



 

4.9.2 each King Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and is held by a King Non-Executive Director shall, to the extent not
vested and exercisable in full, accelerate and become fully vested and
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the
terms of the King Award Agreement, and the King Non-Executive Director shall
be offered the opportunity to (i) exercise the King Option in full immediately
prior to the Effective Time through a Cashless Option Exercise or (ii) agree
that the King Option shall be assumed and converted into an option (an "
**Assumed Non-Executive Director Share Option** ") to acquire the number of AB
Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) that is equal to the product
of (i) the number of King Shares subject to such King Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and (ii) the Exchange Ratio. The Assumed Non-Executive
Director

 



      
 

 



 

Share Option shall have an exercise price per AB Share equal to the quotient
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (x) the exercise
price per King Share of the King Option in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Date by (y) the Exchange Ratio. The remaining term, vesting schedule
and all of the other terms of each Assumed Non-Executive Director Share Option
shall otherwise be on the terms of the King Award Agreement for the King
Option. If the Non-Executive Director does not accept the Rule 15 Proposal
described in this Clause 4.9.2, the King Option shall lapse at the Effective
Time in accordance with the provisions of the King Award Agreement; and

 



 

4.9.3 each King Restricted Share Award held by a King Non-Executive Director
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become "Vested", within the
meaning of the Restricted Share Award Agreement, immediately prior to and
conditional upon the Scheme becoming effective, in accordance with the
provisions of the King Award Agreement.

 



 

4.10 AB shall assume the King 2014 Plan and the King Award Agreements in order
to effectuate the provisions of Clauses 4.2 through 4.9, inclusive.

 



 

4.11 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Clause 4, in the event that
(i) an individual is entitled under a King Award Agreement to accelerated
vesting of a King Option or a King Share Award upon a Change in Control
Termination (as such term is defined in the King Award Agreement or the
individuals service agreement with King, a " **Good Reason Leaver Service
Agreemen** t"), (ii) in the reasonable judgment of King, the individual has a
reasonable basis to assert that an event or circumstance arising from the
Transactions constitutes or will constitute Good Reason for purposes of the
definition of a Change in Control Termination in the applicable King Award
Agreements or Good Reason Leaver Service Agreement and is identified in a
written notice to AB delivered by King contemporaneously with the execution
hereof or is identified by King no later than 30 days prior to the Effective
Date as having such a reasonable basis and AB concurs with Kings assessment,
such concurrence not to be unreasonably withheld, (a " **Good Reason Leaver**
"), and (iii) the Good Reason Leaver agrees to remain in employment with the
AB Group for a period, to be determined by King, but not in excess of six
months after the Effective Date (the " **Transition Period** "), then, subject
to the agreement of the Good Reason Leaver, (i) each unvested King Option
(other than an EMI Option or Linked Option) held by the Good Reason Leaver
shall accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to
the Effective Time with respect to the aggregate number of King Shares subject
to such King Option that would have vested and become exercisable (x) during
the Transition Period and (y) pursuant to the terms of the King Award
Agreement or Good Reason Leaver Service Agreement upon the Good Reason
Leavers Change in Control Termination upon the expiration of the Transition
Period (the " **Good Reason Accelerated Options** ") and (ii) each King RSU
Award held by the Good Reason Leaver shall accelerate and become fully vested
immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to the aggregate number
of King RSUs that would have vested (x) during the Transition Period and (y)
pursuant to the terms of the King Award Agreement or the Good Reason Leaver
Service Agreement upon the Good Reason Leavers Change in Control Termination
upon the expiration of the Transition Period (the " **Good Reason Accelerated
RSUs** "). To the extent not otherwise vested immediately prior to the
Effective Time in accordance with their vesting schedule or accelerated
pursuant to this provision, each King Option and King RSU Award held by a Good
Reason Leaver shall lapse at the Effective Time. In the event that a Good
Reason Leaver voluntarily terminates his or her employment with the AB Group
prior to the end of the Transition Period, AB shall be entitled to exercise
the Clawback Right with respect to the Good Reason Leaver Clawback Shares.

 



 

4.12 Prior to the Effective Time, King and AB shall take all necessary or
appropriate action to effectuate the provisions of Clauses 4.2 through 4.11,
inclusive, including King, the King Board and Compensation Committee of the
King Board taking any and all actions and making all determinations necessary
or appropriate under the King Award Agreements and the King 2014 Plan and
amending the King 2014 Plan and the Pre-IPO Option Agreements, subject to the
terms of the King 2014 Plan and the Pre-IPO Option Agreements permitting King
to make such amendments, as AB shall reasonably request, to permit and
facilitate the assumptions

 



      
 

 



 

and conversions contemplated by Clauses 4.2 through 4.11, inclusive, and, to
the extent permitted by the King 2014 Plan, the Pre-IPO Option Agreements and
applicable Law, cause the assumed King Options subject to the Pre-IPO Option
Agreements to be treated as Substitute Awards as defined in the King 2014
Plan, as assumed by AB, provided always that (i) no such action shall result
in any impairment of the rights of the holder of a King Share Award or King
Option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) no such
action shall result in less favourable tax treatment for the holder of a King
Share Award or King Option.

 



 

4.13 As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than 10 Business Days thereafter, AB shall prepare and file with the SEC a
Form S-8 (or file such other appropriate form) registering the number of AB
Shares necessary to fulfil ABs obligations under Clauses 4.2 through 4.11,
inclusive, and shall take all other necessary or appropriate action to
effectuate the provisions of Clauses 4.2 through 4.11, inclusive.

 



 

4.14 Withholding Taxes

 



 

All amounts payable pursuant to this Clause 4 shall be subject to any required
withholding in respect of Tax, which shall be paid as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time or such other date or dates as expressly provided
for in this Agreement or as required by applicable Law.

 



 

4.15 Amendment of Articles

 



 

King shall procure that the EGM Resolutions include a special resolution
proposing that the Articles of Association of King be amended so that any King
Shares allotted following the EGM will either be subject to the terms of the
Scheme or acquired by AB Sub for the same consideration per King Share as
shall be payable to King Shareholders by AB Sub under the Scheme (depending
upon the timing of such allotment); provided, however that nothing in such
amendment to the Articles of Association of King shall prohibit the sale
(whether on a stock exchange or otherwise) of any King Shares issued on the
exercise of King Options or vesting or settlement of King Share Awards, as
applicable, following the EGM but prior to the sanction of the Scheme by the
High Court, it being always acknowledged that each and every King Share will
be bound by the terms of the Scheme.

 



 

4.16 Change of Control Period Definition

 



 

For the purposes of implementing the provisions of certain King Award
Agreements that contain the term "date of exchange of contracts" in the
definition of "Change of Control Period", each of AB and King shall treat the
date hereof as such date of exchange of contracts.

 



 

4.17 Cash Severance Payments to Good Reason Leavers

 



 

Notwithstanding Clause 4.11, a Good Reason Leaver shall become entitled as of
the date of the termination of his employment with AB to payment of any cash
amount payable under the terms of any Good Leaver Service Agreement by reason
of a Change in Control Termination (as defined in such Good Leaver Service
Agreement).

 



 

 **5.** **King and AB Conduct**

 



 

5.1 Conduct of Business by King

 



 

5.1.1 At all times from the execution of this Agreement until the earlier of
the Effective Time and the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Clause 9, except as may be required by Law, or as required or
expressly permitted by this Agreement, or with the prior written consent of AB
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), King
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, conduct its business in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice in all material
respects.

 



      
 

 



 

5.1.2 King covenants with AB in the manner set forth in Schedule 1.

 



 

5.2 Non-Solicitation

 



 

5.2.1 Subject to any actions which King is required to take so as to comply
with the requirements of the Takeover Rules, King agrees that neither it nor
any member of the King Group shall, and that it shall cause its and their
respective Representatives and it shall use all reasonable endeavours to cause
any Concert Party of King not to, directly or indirectly:

 



 

(a) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any enquiry
with respect to, or the making or submission of, any King Alternative Proposal
or any proposal which would reasonably be expected to lead to a King
Alternative Proposal;

 



 

(b) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding a King
Alternative Proposal with, or, save as required by Law, furnish any non-public
information regarding King to, any person that has made or, to the Knowledge
of King, is considering making a King Alternative Proposal, except to notify
such person as to the existence of the provisions of this Clause 5.2;

 



 

(c) expressly waive, terminate, amend or modify any provision of any
"standstill" or similar obligation of any person with respect to any member of
the King Group; provided that King shall not be (i) prohibited from permitting
any person to make a King Alternative Proposal privately to the King Board or
(ii) required to take, or be prohibited from taking, any action otherwise
prohibited or required by this sub-clause (c) if the King Board determines, in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel), that failure
to take such action or permit such inaction would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

King shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives and shall use all reasonable endeavours to cause its and their
Concert Parties to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect
to any King Alternative Proposal, or any enquiry or proposal that may
reasonably be expected to lead to a King Alternative Proposal, request the
prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished in connection therewith and immediately terminate all physical and
electronic data room access previously granted to any such person or its
Representatives. King shall be responsible for any act done by one of its
Concert Parties which, if done by King, would constitute a breach of the
foregoing provisions of this Clause 5.2.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
King shall have used all reasonable endeavours to cause a non-controlled
Concert Party not to engage in any act which would constitute a breach of this
Clause 5.2.1 and such Concert Party nonetheless engages in such an act, such
act shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement solely for the purposes of
Clause 5.2.2.

 



 

5.2.2 Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Clause 5.2.1, if King
receives a written King Alternative Proposal which did not or does not result
from a knowing or intentional breach of Clause 5.2.1, King may take any or all
of the following actions:

 



 

(a) contact the person who makes such King Alternative Proposal to understand
the terms and conditions thereof;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) furnish non-public information to the third party (and any persons Acting
in Concert with such third party and to their respective potential financing
sources and Representatives) making such King Alternative Proposal (provided
that all such information has previously been provided to AB or is provided to
AB substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such person(s)),
if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, King receives from
the third party an executed confidentiality agreement, or as of the date
hereof such third party is party to such a confidentiality agreement,
containing terms no less restrictive on such third party than the terms in the
AB Confidentiality Agreement are restrictive on AB; provided, however, that if
such confidentiality agreement is executed after the date hereof, such
confidentiality agreement shall permit King to disclose all information
contemplated by Clause 5.2.3 to AB); and

 



 

(c) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party (and such other
persons) with respect to such King Alternative Proposal;

 



 

provided that King shall not be permitted to take the action set forth in sub-
clauses (b) or (c) unless the King Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with Kings financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that
such King Alternative Proposal is, or would reasonably be expected to lead to,
a King Superior Proposal.

 



 

5.2.3 King shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of receipt, or 48
hours if, within such initial 24-hour period, no Executive Officer is or
becomes aware of such receipt) notify AB of the receipt of any King
Alternative Proposal and shall indicate the material terms and conditions of
such King Alternative Proposal and, to the extent permitted by the terms of
any confidentiality agreement with such person existing on the date hereof,
the identity of the person making any such King Alternative Proposal, and
thereafter shall promptly keep AB reasonably informed of any material change
to the terms of any such King Alternative Proposal. Subject to any such
existing confidentiality agreement, King shall provide to AB as soon as
reasonably practicable after receipt or delivery thereof (and in any event
within 24 hours of receipt or delivery) copies of all written correspondence
and other written material exchanged between any member of the King Group (or
any of their respective Representatives) and the person making a King
Alternative Proposal (or such persons Representatives) that describes the
material terms or conditions of such King Alternative Proposal, including
draft agreements, indications of interest or term sheets submitted by either
party in connection therewith. King shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any person
following the date hereof that prohibits King from providing such information
to AB.

 



 

5.2.4 Except as set forth in Clause 5.2.5, neither the King Board nor any
committee thereof shall:

 



 

(a) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to AB), or propose publicly to
withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to AB), the Scheme Recommendation;

 



 

(b) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, any King Alternative Proposal (any of the
foregoing actions in this Clause 5.2.4 being a " **King Change of
Recommendation** ") (it being agreed that the provision by King to AB of
notice or information in connection with a King Alternative Proposal or King
Superior Proposal as required or expressly permitted by this Agreement shall
not, in and of itself, constitute a King Change of Recommendation); or

 



      
 

 



 

(c) cause or allow any member of the King Group to execute or enter into, any
expense reimbursement or break fee payment agreement, letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, transaction agreement, implementation agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, alliance agreement, partnership agreement
or other agreement constituting or with respect to, or that would reasonably
be expected to lead to, any King Alternative Proposal, or requiring, or
reasonably expected to cause, King to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to
consummate the Acquisition other than as contemplated by Clause 9.1.1(h) and
other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Clause 5.2.2.

 



 

5.2.5 Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the King Board from
making a King Change of Recommendation if the King Board has given not less
than 24 hours notice to AB of the holding of a meeting of the King Board (or
a committee thereof) at which a King Change of Recommendation is to be
considered and has concluded, in good faith (after consultation with Kings
outside legal counsel and financial advisors):

 



 

(a) that a King Alternative Proposal constitutes a King Superior Proposal; and

 



 

(b) that the failure to make a King Change of Recommendation would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

provided that (x) promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) following the
King Boards determination (after consultation with Kings outside legal
counsel and financial advisors) that a King Alternative Proposal constitutes a
King Superior Proposal, King has provided a written notice to AB (a "
**Superior Proposal Notice** ") advising AB that King has received a King
Alternative Proposal and specifying the material terms of such King
Alternative Proposal, the identity of the person making such King Alternative
Proposal and such other information with respect thereto required by Clause
5.2.3 and including written notice of the determination of the King Board that
such King Alternative Proposal constitutes a King Superior Proposal, (y) King
has provided AB with an opportunity, for a period of four Business Days
following the time of delivery to AB of the Superior Proposal Notice (as it
may be extended pursuant to the last sentence of this Clause 5.2.5, the "
**Notice Period** "), to discuss in good faith the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Transactions, including an increase in, or modification
of, the Consideration, and such other terms and conditions such that such King
Alternative Proposal no longer constitutes a King Superior Proposal and (z)
following the expiration of such Notice Period, the King Board has determined
in good faith (after consultation with Kings outside legal counsel and
financial advisors) that such King Alternative Proposal continues to
constitute a King Superior Proposal taking into account all changes proposed
in writing by AB during the Notice Period and has provided to AB a further
written notice to such effect (a " **Final Recommendation Change Notice** ").
If, during the Notice Period any material revision is made to the financial
terms or other material terms and conditions of the pertinent King Alternative
Proposal in writing, King shall, promptly following each such revision,
deliver a new Superior Proposal Notice to AB and comply with the requirements
of this Clause 5.2.5 with respect to such new Superior Proposal Notice, except
that the Notice Period shall be the greater of one Business Day and the amount
of time remaining in the initial Notice Period.

 



 

5.2.6 Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict King or
the King Board from (a) making any disclosure to the King Shareholders
required by Law (after consultation with Kings outside legal counsel)
provided such disclosure does not constitute a King Change of Recommendation
or (b) taking and disclosing to the King Shareholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to shareholders);
provided, however, that in no event shall this Clause 5.2.6 affect the
obligations of King set forth in Clauses 5.2.1 through 5.2.5, inclusive;
provided, further, that any such disclosure pursuant to sub-clause (b) above
shall constitute a King Change of Recommendation unless such disclosure (i)
expressly states that the Scheme Recommendation has not changed, (ii)
expressly states that the King Board rejects the applicable King Alternative
Proposal or (iii) is a "stop, look and listen" communication contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(a) King has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement, subject (in the case of
this Agreement) to receipt of the King Shareholder Approval to consummate the
Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Expenses

actions in connection with the Scheme with, and the receipt of the required
approval of the Scheme by, the High Court, and (iii) the filing of the Court
Order with the Registrar of Companies, no other corporate proceedings on the
part of King are necessary to authorise the consummation of the Transactions.
On or prior to the date hereof, the King Board has determined that the
Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of King and the King
Shareholders and has adopted a resolution to make, subject to Clause 5.2 and
to the obligations of the King Board under the Takeover Rules, the Scheme
Recommendation. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and

the Act, (ii) the Takeover Panel Act and the Takeover Rules, (iii) the

or filings (A) that, if not obtained or made, would not reasonably be expected
to materially impede or prevent the consummation of the Acquisition or (B) as
may arise as a result of facts or circumstances solely or primarily relating
to AB or its Affiliates or Laws or Contracts binding on AB or its Affiliates.

 



 

(c) Assuming compliance with the Scheme, Chapter 1 of Part 9 of the Act and

or prevented in a timely manner. King maintains, with respect to the King
Group, a system of "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that all
material information concerning the King Group is made known on a timely basis
to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the King SEC Documents
and other required public disclosure documents, and otherwise to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by King in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the required
certifications in connection therein.

reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect Kings ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial data; and (ii) any fraud,

a significant role in Kings internal controls over financial reporting. King

(ii) "material weakness" in the internal controls over financial reporting; or
(iii) fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other

reporting. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency"
and "material weakness" shall have the meanings assigned to them by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board in Auditing Standard No. 5.

King SEC Documents, other than the financial information furnished as part of
Kings periodic earnings releases, (i) were prepared in accordance with IFRS
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered (except as may be
indicated in the notes to such financial statements or, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC, and except that the unaudited
financial statements may not contain footnotes and are subject to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments that will not, individually or in the
aggregate, be material in amount); and (ii) fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the King Group as of the
respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash
flows of the King Group for the periods covered thereby (subject, with respect

respect to any material King Intellectual Property; or (ii) affect any of the
material terms or conditions of any license, covenant not to sue, release,
immunity or other right that any member of the King Group has granted, grants,
may grant or must grant with respect to any material King Intellectual
Property.

other Action of any nature in the United States, Canada, the European Union,

bound by any Contract with any Person (other than the King Associates) that
materially prohibits or materially restricts a group of its employees from:
(i) certain work assignments; (ii) moving within, between or among any members
of the King Group and their Affiliates (or their organization or business
units); or (iii) performing any services for or working with any third party,
to the extent that each of the foregoing prohibitions or restrictions,
individually or in the aggregate, are material to the business of any member
of the King Group.

 



 

(g) To the Knowledge of King, there are no facts or circumstances that King
reasonably expects would render invalid or unenforceable any Core Trademark as
used in an interactive video game of the King Group in the United States,
Canada, the European Union, Japan, South Korea or China.

 



 

(h) To the Knowledge of King, no member of the King Group and none of the King
Products or King Product Software is currently infringing (directly,
contributorily, by inducement or otherwise), misappropriating, or otherwise
violating or, at any time during the 24-month period prior to the date hereof,
has infringed (directly, contributorily, by inducement or otherwise),
misappropriated, or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property Right of any
other Person, where such infringement, misappropriation, or violation would,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be likely to have a
material adverse effect on the King Group.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) To the Knowledge of King, none of the King Product Software contains any
"back door," "drop dead device," "time bomb," "Trojan horse," "virus" or
"worm" (as such terms are commonly understood in the software industry) or any
other similar code, in each case, that has resulted in any of the following,
or any other code designed or intended to have any of the following functions:
(i) materially disrupting, disabling, harming or otherwise materially impeding
in any manner the operation of, or providing unauthorized access to, a
computer system or network or other device on which such code is stored or
installed; or (ii) materially damaging or destroying any data or file without
the users consent.

any provision of the applicable license agreement for any Open Source Software
that is contained in, distributed with or used in the development of any King
Product Software or any King Product containing or used in conjunction with
any King Product Software, which violation would, individually or in the
aggregate, have or be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
the King Group.

 



 

(k) During the last 24 months, no member of the King Group has received any
written claim from a third party that any Material King Product incorporates,
is integrated with, or, links to any Open Source Software in such a manner
that requires any member of the King Group to distribute any material
proprietary source code for such King Product under the terms of an Open
Source Software license, and, to the Knowledge of King, there would be no
reasonable basis for such a claim to be made by a third party. Each member of
the King Group has used commercially reasonable efforts to regulate its use
and distribution of Open Source Software in compliance with applicable Open
Source Software licenses.

 



 

(l) No material source code for any King Product Software has been delivered,
licensed or disclosed to any escrow agent or other Person (other than (i) to

obligation (whether present, contingent or otherwise) to deliver, license or
disclose the source code for any material King Product Software to any escrow
agent or other Person. Except with respect to the foregoing, to the Knowledge
of King, no event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists, that
(with or without notice or lapse of time) will, or could reasonably be
expected to, result in the delivery, license or disclosure of any material
source code for any material King Product Software to any other Person.

 



 

(m) Section 6.1.12(m) of Part A of the King Disclosure Letter contains a list,
as of the date hereof, of all standards-setting organization and multi-party
special interest groups in which any member of the King Group participates
where such participation requires any member of the King Group to grant third
parties a license with respect to any material King Intellectual Property.

and that it takes due consideration of any reasonable comments that the other
Parties may have in relation to such proposed communication, provided that it
shall not be required to provide the other Parties with any confidential
information or business secrets.

 



 

7.1.5 AB and King shall:

 



 

(a) promptly advise each other of (and AB or King shall so advise with respect
to communications received by any Subsidiary of AB or King, as the case may
be) any written or oral communication from any Relevant Authority or third
party whose Clearance is required or reasonably necessary in connection with
the consummation of the Transactions;

 



 

(b) not participate in any meeting or discussion with any Relevant Authority
in respect of any filing, investigation or enquiry concerning this Agreement
or the Transactions unless it consults with the other Party in advance, and,
unless prohibited by such Relevant Authority, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend; and

 



 

(c) promptly furnish the other Party with copies of all correspondence,
filings, and written communications between them and their Subsidiaries and
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Relevant Authority or its respective
staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions,
except that materials may be redacted (x) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the businesses of King or AB or their respective Affiliates, (y)
as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (z) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns. AB shall not consent
to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to
any voluntary delay of the consummation of the Transactions at the behest of
any Relevant Authority without the consent of King, and King shall not consent
to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to
any voluntary delay of the consummation of the Transactions at the behest of
any Relevant Authority without the consent of AB, which consent, in each case,
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. With respect to
any notice, documentation or other communication required to be given by
either Party to the other Party pursuant to this Clause 7.1.5, such first
Party may give such notice, documentation or other communication to such
second Partys outside counsel, instead of directly to such second Party, if
such first Party reasonably believes that doing so is required by, or
advisable pursuant to, applicable Law.

 



 

7.1.6 Each Party shall provide as promptly as practicable such information and
documentary material as may be requested by a Relevant Authority following any
such filing or notification and, subject to Clauses 7.1.7 and 7.1.8, shall
negotiate with any Relevant Authority in relation to any undertakings, orders,
agreements or commitments which any such Relevant Authority requires to
facilitate the Acquisition.

 



      
 

 



 

7.1.7 Each member of the King Group agrees to take, or cause to be taken,
subject to receipt by King of the prior written consent of AB (which consent
may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and AB and its
Subsidiaries agree to take, or cause to be taken, subject to Clause 7.1.8, any
and all steps and to make, or cause to be made, any and all undertakings
necessary to resolve such objections, if any, that a Relevant Authority may
assert under any Antitrust Law with respect to the Acquisition and to avoid or
eliminate each and every objection under any Antitrust Law that may be
asserted by any Relevant Authority with respect to the Acquisition, in each
case, so as to enable the Completion to occur as promptly as practicable and
in any event no later than the End Date, provided that any such steps or
undertakings are immaterial to AB, King or their combined business (assuming
for this purpose that such combined businesses were the size of King).

 



 

7.1.8 Nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be deemed to require, AB (or
any of its Subsidiaries) to (and King shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, without the prior written consent of AB) take any action,
agree to take any action or consent to the taking of any action (including
with respect to selling, holding separate or otherwise disposing of any
business or assets or conducting its (or its Subsidiaries) business in any
specified manner) if such action would (a) require any entity (including its
Subsidiaries) to divest, hold separate or otherwise take any action that
limits such entitys freedom of action, ownership or control with respect to,
or its ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any of its
businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or properties or any
equity interest in any joint venture held by such entity, (b) require any
undertaking to license any Intellectual Property of the AB Group or any King
Intellectual Property or to grant any third party access for marketing
purposes to the player networks of any member of the AB Group or the King
Group, (c) reasonably be expected to impose any limitation on or result in a
material delay in the ability of AB Sub to acquire, or to hold or to exercise
effectively, directly or indirectly, all or any rights of ownership of shares
(or the equivalent) in, or to exercise voting or management control over, King
or any member of the King Group or on the ability of any member of the King
Group to hold or exercise effectively, directly or indirectly, rights of
ownership of shares (or the equivalent) in, or to exercise rights of voting or
management control over, any member of the King Group, (d) be a limitation on
the ability of AB or its Subsidiaries to integrate or co-ordinate its
business, or any part of it, with the business of the King Group, or (e)
result in a member of the AB Group or the King Group ceasing to be able to
carry on business in any jurisdiction it does at the date hereof. For the
avoidance of doubt, the obligation to use all reasonable endeavours to achieve
satisfaction of the Conditions for the purposes of Clause 7.1.2 will not cause
AB or King to be obliged to do or permit or consent to anything that is
inconsistent with this Clause 7.1.8.

 



 

7.1.9 In the event that the Acquisition is not consummated by reason of
objections raised by any Relevant Authority under any Antitrust Laws or
failure to obtain a Clearance referenced in Condition 3.6, and (a) such
objections would reasonably have been expected to be resolved if AB had agreed
to take or cause to be taken specified actions (including actions of the type
described in Clause 7.1.8) that would have been immaterial to AB, King or
their combined business (assuming for this purpose that such combined
businesses were the size of King) and (b) AB did not agree to take or cause to
be taken such specified actions, then AB shall be obligated to pay King
$100,000,000 in cleared, immediately available funds as promptly as possible
(but in any event within three Business Days) thereafter.

 



 

7.1.10 Until the Effective Time (or termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms), no member of the AB Group shall acquire, agree to
acquire, submit a notification to a Relevant Authority regarding an
acquisition or intention to acquire or publicly announce a legally binding
Contract or specific plans to acquire (in each case, other than the
Acquisition) any Person (or any assets or securities thereof) that is
primarily engaged in the business of developing and/or publishing mobile
games, if such acquisition or legally binding Contract would involve payment
of aggregate consideration in an amount or having a value in excess of
$1,000,000,000.

 



      
 

 



 

7.1.11 Notwithstanding the reference in Condition 3.1.1 to the "sole
discretion" of AB Sub, the exercise of such sole discretion by AB Sub shall
require compliance by AB Sub with the provisions of this Clause 7.

 



 

7.2 Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance

 



 

7.2.1 For a period of six years after the Effective Date, AB shall maintain in
effect the provisions for indemnification, advancement of expenses, payment of
related enforcement costs or exculpation in the Organisational Documents of
each member of the King Group or in any agreement to which any member of the
King Group is a party and shall, if it is amending any such Organisational
Documents, retain such provisions in a manner that will ensure that the rights
thereunder of any individuals who at any time prior to the Effective Time were
directors, officers or employees of any member of the King Group or were
directors, officers, members, trustees or fiduciaries of another company,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise if such service was at the request or
for the benefit of any member of the King Group (each, together with his or
her respective heirs and representatives, a " **King Indemnified Party** "
and, collectively, the " **King Indemnified Parties** ") in respect of actions
or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Date (including actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time arising out of the
Transactions) will not be adversely affected; provided, however, that in the
event any claim, action, suit proceeding or investigation is pending, asserted
or made whether prior to the Effective Date or within such six-year period,
all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses or exculpation required
to be continued pursuant to this Clause 7.2.1 in respect thereof shall
continue until disposition thereof even if such disposition occurs after the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Date. For a period of six years after the
Effective Date, AB shall assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and
honour and guarantee, and shall cause King and its Subsidiaries to honour, in
accordance with their respective terms, (a) the provisions for
indemnification, advancement of expenses or exculpation in the Organisational
Documents of each member of the King Group and its Subsidiaries or in any
agreement to which any member of the King Group is a party and (b) each of the
covenants contained in this Clause 7.2.

 



 

7.2.2 For a period of six years from the Effective Date, AB shall cause to be
maintained in effect:

 



 

(a) the coverage provided by the policies of directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect as of the
Completion Date maintained by any member of the King Group with respect to
matters arising on or before the Effective Time (provided that AB may
substitute therefor policies with a carrier with comparable credit ratings to
the existing carrier of at least the same coverage and amounts containing
terms and conditions that are no less favourable to the insured persons (other
than changes to the terms and conditions in the applicable insurers form that
are not material to the beneficiaries thereof)); or

 



 

(b) a "tail" policy (which King may purchase at its option, subject to ABs
prior consultation, prior to the Effective Time, and, in such case, AB shall
cause such policy to be in full force and effect, and shall cause all
obligations thereunder to be honoured by King) under Kings existing
directors and officers insurance policy that covers those persons who are
currently covered by Kings directors and officers insurance policy in
effect as of the date hereof for actions and omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, is from a carrier with comparable credit ratings to
Kings existing directors and officers insurance policy carrier and contains
terms and conditions that, in the aggregate, are no less favourable to the
insured persons than those of Kings directors and officers insurance policy
in effect as of the date hereof;

 



       
 

 



 

provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, AB shall not be
required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium
paid by King prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to
be obtained pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Clause 7.2.2 and AB shall not be
required to pay, and King shall not be permitted to pay, a total premium in
excess of 600% of the last such annual premium in respect of any "tail" policy
obtained pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Clause 7.2.2, but in either such
case the relevant Party shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount.

 



 

7.2.3 The rights of each King Indemnified Party under this Clause 7.2 shall be
in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such King
Indemnified Party may have under the Organisational Documents of each member
of the King Group as applicable, any agreement, any insurance policy, the Act
(or any other applicable Law) or otherwise. The provisions of this Clause 7.2
shall survive the consummation of the Transactions and shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any King Indemnified Party
without the written consent of such affected King Indemnified Party (it being
expressly agreed that the King Indemnified Parties shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this Clause 7.2 and shall be entitled to enforce the
covenants contained in this Clause 7.2).

 



 

7.3 Employment and Benefit Matters

 



 

7.3.1 For a period of two years following the Effective Date, AB shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each King Employee:

 



 

(a) base compensation that is equal to or greater than the base compensation
provided to such King Employee prior to the Effective Time; and

 



 

(b) cash bonus opportunities, the aggregate annual amount of which are
substantially comparable in target amount to those provided to such King
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

For a period of two years following the Effective Date, AB shall provide, or
shall cause to be provided, on an aggregate (and not individual) basis across
the King Group, pensions, retirement and benefits (excluding severance
benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided
to the King Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to an
aggregate increase in annual cost not to exceed 10% to such King Employees
employers.

 



 

Further, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, AB shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, during the two-year
period following the Effective Date, severance benefits to each King Employee
in accordance with, or no less favourable than, Kings past practice or
policy, giving full credit for each King Employees full years of service with
the King Group and its predecessors prior to the Effective Time and full years
of service with AB and its Affiliates following the Effective Time.

 



 

7.3.2 King shall have the right to pay to each employee of any member of the
King Group all unpaid bonuses that have been earned or accrued, and which have
become payable, in the ordinary course consistent with past practice relating
to the period (or any part thereof) up to the Effective Date, and where any
such bonuses become payable after Completion, AB shall procure that the
relevant member of the King Group shall pay such bonuses to their employees in
accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to the payment of such
bonuses.

 



      
 

 



 

7.3.3 From the Effective Date, each King Employee (other than any King
Employees identified by King as transitional for this purpose) shall become a
participant in the King profit sharing plan which is anticipated to be
established for 2016 and consistent with the summary of terms agreed by the
Parties prior to the date hereof (the " **King Profit Sharing Plan** ") and
the profit sharing pool under the King Profit Sharing Plan shall be calculated
for the calendar year 2016 as if the plan had commenced on January 1, 2016.
King shall reasonably consult with AB regarding the timing and content of any
announcement to King employees about the King Profit Sharing Plan. Except as
provided in the next succeeding sentence, for 2016, an amount equal to (i) the
sum of the grant date values of all incentive equity that is granted by King
to its employees on or after January 1, 2016 (including, for the 2016 annual
grants, promotions, adhoc grants for retention purposes and new hire grants),
as determined accordance with the US GAAP used by AB with respect to similar
awards for purposes of measuring compensation expense for such awards accrued
for financial accounting purposes, reduced (but not below zero) by (ii) $15
million, shall be deducted from the 2016 profit sharing pool as detailed in
the King Profit Sharing Plan. In determining the equity incentives to be taken
into account under the immediately preceding sentence, any equity incentives
approved prior to October 30, 2015 that are granted in 2016 in accordance with
the authority provided under paragraph 8.1 of Schedule 1 shall be excluded.
Other than as contemplated by sub-paragraphs 8.1, 8.2, 8.4 and 8.5 of Schedule
1 or as set out in Section 6.1.3(d) of Part A of the King Disclosure Letter,
King agrees that the only equity incentive grants to be made from the date
hereof prior to January 1, 2016 shall be for new hires, promotions or adhoc
grants for retention purposes and such grants shall be in such amounts and
have such terms and conditions which are in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice.

 



 

7.3.4 For the purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of
benefits under the King Benefit Plans pursuant to which AB provides benefits
to any King Employee after the Effective Time (the " **New Plans** "), each
King Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the King
Group and its predecessors before the Effective Date, to the same extent as
such King Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar King Benefit Plan in which such King Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective
Time; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing:

 



 

(a) each King Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such
New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a King Benefit Plan in which
such King Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the " **Old Plans** "); and

 



 

(b) for the purposes of each New Plan providing disability, medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any King Employee, AB shall use all
reasonable endeavours to cause (and where this is not possible, provide
reasonable compensation for):

 



 

(i) all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered
dependents, unless and to the extent the individual, immediately prior to his
or her coverage under the New Plans, was subject to such conditions under the
comparable Old Plans; and

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Plan for the purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



 

7.3.5 Where AB maintains any of the Old Plans in full force and effect, the
provisions of Clause 7.3.4 shall not apply with respect to the benefits
available under such Old Plans unless and until AB replaces such Old Plans
with New Plans. Nothing in this Agreement shall require AB to replace the Old
Plans with New Plans where the Old Plans remain in full force and effect.

 



 

7.3.6 Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any King Employee any right
to continue in the employment or service of any member of the King Group, AB
or any Affiliate of AB, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the
rights of any member of the King Group, AB or any Affiliate of AB, which
rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services
of any King Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without
cause. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this Clause 7.3 shall (x) be deemed or construed to be an amendment
or other modification of any King Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan,
arrangement or agreement of AB, or (y) create any third-party rights in any
current or former service provider of AB, King or any of their respective
Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 



 

7.4 Financing Cooperation

 



 

7.4.1 Prior to the Completion Date, King shall use all reasonable endeavours
to provide to AB, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use all
reasonable endeavours to cause the respective officers, directors, employees
and advisors and other Representatives, including legal and accounting, of
each member of the King Group to, provide to AB and its Subsidiaries such
cooperation as may be reasonably requested by AB in connection with the
syndication and consummation of the Financing (provided that, in each case,
such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the business
or operations of any member of the King Group), including:

 



 

(a) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road
shows, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions or sessions with prospective
lenders, investors and rating agencies, in each case as reasonably requested
and upon reasonable advance notice; provided, however, that such participation
will be limited to Kings Executive Officers and will be solely for the
purpose of providing information in relation to King;

 



 

(b) providing information in connection with the preparation of materials for
rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda, lender presentations,
investor presentations and other customary marketing materials and documents
required or necessary in connection with the Financing and the Transactions,
including furnishing customary and reasonable business and financial
projections reasonably requested by AB or any of its Subsidiaries, furnishing
customary and reasonable records, data or other information necessary to
support any statistical information or claims relating to any member of the
King Group appearing in the aforementioned marketing materials, and, at the
reasonable request of AB, providing necessary support and information to
enable AB to prepare materials demonstrating the

 



      
 

 



 

meaningful differences in measurement of the King Groups historical financial
performance under IFRS compared to US GAAP, consenting (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to AB filing a Form 8-K with
the SEC disclosing information identified by AB relating to the King Group
(other than projections) for purposes of permitting such information to be
included in marketing materials or memoranda for the Financing to be provided
to potential investors who do not wish to receive material non-public
information with respect to AB and its Subsidiaries, the King Group or any of
their respective securities; provided, however, that nothing in this sub-
clause requires King to provide (i) information regarding compensation, (ii)
US GAAP financial information or (iii) anything that will result in
unreasonable interference with the business of King;

 



 

(c) furnishing AB, as promptly as reasonably practicable upon request by AB in
connection with the Financing, with the following financial information
regarding the King Group: (i) the audited consolidated statements of financial
position for the fiscal years ended on December 31, 2012, December 31, 2013
and December 31, 2014 (and, if applicable, each subsequent fiscal year ended
at least 90 days prior to the Completion Date) and related audited
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity
and cash flows of the King Group for the fiscal years ended on December 31,
2012, December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014 (and, if applicable, each
subsequent fiscal year ended at least 90 days prior to the Completion Date),
in each case, prepared in accordance with IFRS, and in compliance with
Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act (" **Regulation S-X** "),
and (ii) the unaudited consolidated statements of financial position and
related consolidated statements of operations of the King Group for each
subsequent fiscal quarter ended at least 45 days prior to the Completion Date,
and for the comparable period of the prior fiscal year, in each case, prepared
in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, as issued by IASB;
provided, however, that nothing in this sub-clause (c) requires King to
provide (A) information regarding compensation, (B) US GAAP financial
information or (C) information that is subject to confidentiality agreements,
or is privileged, or is otherwise confidential and is a trade secret or
competitively sensitive (unless disclosure is required to avoid a material
misstatement or omission or is material non-public information and disclosed
pursuant to Clause 7.4.1(b) above). Subject to disclosures contemplated by
sub-clause (C) of the immediately preceding sentence, AB shall cause all non-
public or other confidential information provided by or on behalf of King or
any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives pursuant to this Clause 7.4 to be
kept confidential in accordance with the AB Confidentiality Agreement;

 



 

(d) furnishing AB, as promptly as reasonably practicable and prior to
Completion with financial and other information with respect to the members of
the King Group prepared in accordance with the applicable provisions of US
GAAP and Regulation S-X reasonably necessary for AB to (i) evaluate the
significance of the members of the King Group pursuant to Regulation S-X and
(ii) prepare pro forma financial statements (including financial information
with respect to the members of the King Group as of and for (x) the most
recent annual period provided pursuant to sub-clause (c)(i) above, (y) the
most recent interim period provided pursuant to sub-clause (c)(ii) above and
(z) the 12-month period ending on the most recent statements of financial
position date of King provided pursuant to sub-clauses (c)(i) or (c)(ii)
above), prepared by AB after giving effect to the Transactions and the
Financing as if such transactions and the Financing had occurred as of such
date (in the case of statements of financial position) or at the beginning of
such period (in the case of other financial statements) in accordance with the
applicable provisions of US GAAP and Regulation S-X;

 



      
 

 



 

(e) reasonably cooperating with requests for due diligence to the extent
customary for financings of a type similar to the Financing and provided that
such requests do not unreasonably interfere with the business of King;

 



 

(f) providing promptly, and in any event, at least three Business Days prior
to the Completion Date, such customary documentation and other customary
information about the King Group as is reasonably requested in writing by AB
reasonably in advance of, and in any event, at least 20 calendar days prior
to, the Completion Date in connection with the Financing that relates to
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act;

 



 

(g) assisting with the preparation of any credit agreements, indentures,
notes, security purchase agreements, guarantees, pledge and security
documents, hedging arrangements, other definitive financing documents, and

opinions customary in connection with financings of a type similar to the
Financing as may be reasonably requested by AB or any of its Subsidiaries; and

 



 

(h) cooperating with AB and ABs efforts to obtain corporate and facilities
ratings as reasonably requested by AB.

 



 

provided that:

 



 

(i) no member of the King Group shall be required to pay any commitment or
other fee or incur any cost, expense or liability (other than fees and
expenses that are to be promptly reimbursed by AB under Clause 7.4.2) in
connection with the Financing prior to the Completion Date;

 



 

(ii) the King Board and officers of King prior to the Completion Date and the
directors and officers of the Subsidiaries of King prior to the Completion
Date shall not be required to adopt resolutions approving the agreements,
documents and instruments pursuant to which the Financing is obtained;

 



 

(iii) no member of the King Group shall be required to execute, prior to the
Completion Date, any financing agreements, including any credit, security,
pledge or other agreements in connection with the Financing, or deliver any
solvency, officers or similar certificates or legal opinions in connection
with the Financing, in each case, that are not subject to the occurrence of
the Completion Date (other than representation letters required by King and
its Subsidiaries auditors in connection with the delivery of "comfort
letters"); and

 



 

(iv) except as expressly provided above, no member of the King Group shall be
required to take any corporate actions that are not subject to the occurrence
of the Completion Date to permit the consummation of the Financing.

 



 

7.4.2 AB shall, promptly upon request by King, reimburse King for all
reasonable documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any member
of the King Group in connection with cooperation under this Clause 7.4 and
shall indemnify and hold harmless King, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives (including the King Board and officers of King or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Completion Date) from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, expenses, interest, judgments and
penalties (each, a " **Loss** ") suffered or incurred by them in connection
with the syndication or consummation of the Financing, any information
utilised in connection therewith and any action taken by them at the request
of AB or its Representatives (other than information provided by any member of
the King Group or to the extent a Loss arises from the gross negligence, bad
faith or misconduct of or a breach of this Agreement by an indemnified party).

 



      
 

 



 

7.4.3 King shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, supplement the
information provided in connection with the Financing on a reasonably current
basis to the extent that any such information, to the Knowledge of King,
contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not false or misleading in any material respect at the time
and in light of the circumstances under which such statement is made, promptly
after gaining Knowledge thereof.

 



 

7.4.4 King hereby consents to the use of the names and marks of King and its
Affiliates (including any Trademarks derived therefrom) in connection with the
Financing; provided, that such names and marks are used solely in a manner
that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage King or its
Affiliates or their reputation, goodwill or intellectual property.

 



 

7.4.5 King shall use all reasonable endeavours to assist in the delivery to AB
of customary payoff letters, lien terminations and instruments of discharge in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to AB to allow for the payoff,
discharge and termination in full on the ABL credit facility under the ABL
Credit Agreement dated as of October 7, 2013, as amended, among Midasplayer
International Holding Company Limited, King.com Limited, Midasplayer Vertriebs
GmbH, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the other parties thereto.

 



 

7.4.6 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, nothing in
this Clause 7.4 shall require any member of the King Group to take any action
that would violate Section 82 of the Act.

 



 

7.5 Transaction Challenges

 



 

7.5.1 King shall consult and cooperate with AB in Kings defence or settlement
of any actual or threatened shareholder litigation (other than any litigation
or settlement between King or any of its Affiliates and AB, AB Sub or any of

 **8.** **Completion of Acquisition**

 



 

8.1 Completion Date

 



 

8.1.1 Completion shall take place at 5:00 p.m., Irish time, on a date to be
agreed by the Parties, being not more than three Business Days (or such
shorter period of time as remains before 11:59 p.m., Irish time, on the End
Date) after the satisfaction or, in the sole discretion of AB Sub, waiver

9.1 Termination

 



 

9.1.1 This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective
Time:

 



 

(a) by either King or AB if the Scheme Meeting or the EGM shall have been
completed and the Scheme Meeting Resolution or the EGM Resolutions, as
applicable, shall not have been approved by the requisite majorities;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) by either King or AB if the Effective Time shall not have occurred by
11:59 p.m., Irish time, on the End Date, provided that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Clause 9.1.1(b) shall not be available to a
Party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement shall have caused the
failure of the Effective Time to have occurred by such time;

 



 

(c) by either King or AB if the High Court declines or refuses to sanction the

appealed (it being agreed that King shall make such an appeal if requested to

(d) by either King or AB if an injunction shall have been entered permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the

material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which material breach or failure to
perform:

 



 

(i) would result in a failure of any Conditions; and

 



 

(ii) if curable, is not cured within 30 days following Kings delivery of
written notice to AB of such breach or failure to perform (which notice shall
state Kings intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Clause
9.1.1(e) and the basis for such termination);

 



 

(f) by AB, if King shall have breached or failed to perform in any material
respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, which material breach or failure to perform:

 



 

(i) would result in a failure of any Conditions; and

 



 

(ii) if curable, is not cured within 30 days following ABs delivery of

9.1.1(f) and the basis for such termination);

 



 

(g) by AB, in the event that a King Change of Recommendation shall have
occurred;

 



 

(h) by King upon written notice at any time following delivery of a Final

9.1.2 Termination of this Agreement in accordance with Clause 9.1.1 shall not
give rise to any liability of the Parties except as provided in the Expenses
Reimbursement Agreement or Clause 7.1.9, and, following such termination, no
Party shall have any liability to the other Parties in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions, except as provided in the Expenses
Reimbursement Agreement; provided that such termination shall not relieve any
Party from liability for fraud or willful breach of, or failure to perform,
this Agreement. Clause 10 (other than Clauses 10.1 and 10.11) shall survive,
and continue in full force and effect, notwithstanding the termination of this
Agreement. If AB or AB Sub bring a successful action against King for
liability for willful breach of, or failure to perform, this Agreement, then
all amounts (if any) paid by King to AB under Clause 3.2.1(a) of the Expenses
Reimbursement Agreement which are included in any award made by a court of
competent jurisdiction against King arising from liability for willful breach
of, or failure to perform, this Agreement shall be credited against the amount

9.1.3 Each Party understands and confirms that termination of this Agreement
shall:

(including the Panel), the Parties shall consult together as to the terms of,
the timing of and the manner of publication of any formal public announcement
which either Party may make primarily regarding the Transactions, the Scheme
or this Agreement. AB and King shall give each other a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment upon any such public announcement and shall not issue
any such public announcement prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by applicable Law, the Takeover Rules, a court order, the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, the SEC or any Relevant Authority (including the
Panel). The Parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with
respect to the Transactions shall be in the form of the Rule 2.5 Announcement.

 



 

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of Clause 10.1(a) do not apply
to any announcement, document or publication in connection with a King
Alternative Proposal or King Superior Proposal or a change in the Scheme
Recommendation, provided that King shall have provided an advance copy of any
such proposed announcement to AB before release, or any amendment to the terms
of the Scheme proposed by AB that would effect an increase in the
Consideration whether before or after a withdrawal or adverse modification of

Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources
that are party to the Financing and so adversely affected. It is expressly
agreed that the Financing Sources in their capacities as such shall be third-
party beneficiaries of the immediately preceding sentence of this Clause 10.5
and shall be entitled to enforce such sentence as if they were a party to this
Agreement. It is further expressly agreed that the preceding two sentences of
this Clause 10.5 shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of
such state that would result in the application of the laws of any other state
or jurisdiction.

 



 

10.6 Entire Agreement

 



 

This Agreement, together with the AB Confidentiality Agreement, the Expenses
Reimbursement Agreement and any documents delivered by the AB Parties and King
in connection herewith, constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the AB
Parties (or any of them) and King with respect to the subject matter hereof,
it being understood that the AB Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and that no action by any Party
contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed to breach the AB
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

10.7 Inadequacy of Damages

 



 

Each Party agrees that damages would not be an adequate remedy for any breach
by it of this Agreement and accordingly each Party shall be entitled, without
proof of special damages, to the remedies of injunction, specific performance
or other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach of this
Agreement.

 



 

10.8 Remedies and Waivers

 



 

No delay or omission by either Party to this Agreement in exercising any
right, power or remedy provided by Law or under this Agreement shall:

 



      
 

 



 

10.8.1 affect that right, power or remedy; or

 



 

10.8.2 operate as a waiver of it.

or under this Agreement shall not preclude any other or further exercise of it
or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

 



 

10.9 Severability

 



 

If at any time any provision of this Agreement is or becomes illegal, invalid
or unenforceable in any respect under the Law of any jurisdiction that shall
not affect or impair:

 



 

10.9.1 the legality, validity or enforceability in that jurisdiction of any
other provision of this Agreement; or

 



 

10.9.2 the legality, validity or enforceability under the Law of any other
jurisdiction of that or any other provision of this Agreement; and

 



 

it is agreed by the Parties that a court of competent jurisdiction may sever
any such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision and should any provision
of this Agreement be invalid or unenforceable, then such provision shall be
deemed to have been automatically amended in such a way that, as amended, it
is valid, legal and enforceable and to the maximum extent possible carries out
the original intent of the Parties as to the matter or matters in question.

 



 

10.10 No Partnership and No Agency

 



 

10.10.1 Nothing in this Agreement and no action taken by the Parties pursuant
to this Agreement shall constitute, or be deemed to constitute, a partnership,
association, joint venture or other co-operative entity between any of the
Parties.

 



 

10.10.2 Nothing in this Agreement and no action taken by the Parties pursuant
to this Agreement shall constitute, or be deemed to constitute, either Party
the agent of the other Party for any purpose. No Party has, pursuant to this
Agreement, any authority or power to bind or to contract in the name of the
other Party.

 



 

10.11 Further Assurance

 



 

Without limitation to the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties shall, and
shall procure that each member of their respective Groups shall, issue,
execute or despatch such documentation in a timely fashion or take other
actions as is necessary or desirable to facilitate the implementation of the
Transactions or carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

discharged by AB);

 



 

each Party shall pay its own costs and expenses of and incidental to this
Agreement, the Acquisition and all other Transactions, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement.

 



 

10.13 No Third-Party Rights

 



 

Subject as provided in Clauses 7.2, 10.5, 10.14.3 and 10.14.4, no one other
than a Party shall have any right to enforce any of its terms and no third
party shall be a beneficiary in any way of this Agreement or have the right to
rely on any provision hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

10.14 Governing Law and Jurisdiction

 



 

10.14.1 Except as provided herein, this Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of Ireland, without regard to the
conflicts of law rules of Ireland that would result in the application of the
laws of any other jurisdiction.

 



 

10.14.2 Except as provided herein, each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that
the courts of Ireland are to have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and, for such purposes,
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in Ireland.
Any proceeding, suit or action arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement shall therefore be brought in the courts of Ireland.

 



 

10.14.3 Financing Sources Arrangements

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein. King, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates and Representatives, hereby (i) acknowledges that
none of the Financing Sources in their capacities as such shall have any
liability under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the Transactions, including any dispute related to, or arising
from, the Financing, the related commitment letter or the performance thereof,
(ii) waives any rights or claims against any of the Financing Sources in their
capacities as such in connection with this Agreement, the Financing or the
related commitment letter, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and (iii) agrees not to commence (and if commenced agrees to
dismiss or otherwise terminate, and not to assist) any action, arbitration,
audit, hearing, investigation, litigation, petition, grievance, complaint,
suit or proceeding against any Financing Source in its capacity as such in
connection with this Agreement, the Financing, the related commitment letter
or the Transactions. With respect to any dispute or proceeding relating to
this Clause 10.14.3, King, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and
Representatives, (w) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of
the State of New York or federal courts of the United States of America, in
each case, sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, and any appellate court from
any thereof (the courts described in this clause (w), the " **Applicable
Courts** "), and agrees that all claims in respect of any such litigation may
be heard and determined only in the Applicable Courts, (x) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally do so, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any proceeding in any Applicable
Court, (y) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defences of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such proceeding in any Applicable
Court, and (z) agrees that a final judgment in any such proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Clause 10.14.3 is
intended to, or shall, affect the rights or remedies of the parties to the
Financing.

 



 

It is expressly agreed that the Financing Sources in their capacities as such
shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Clause 10.14.3 and shall be
entitled to enforce the provisions contained in this Clause 10.14.3 as if they
were a party to this Agreement. It is further expressly agree that the
provisions of this Clause 10.14.3, shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the
conflicts of law rules of such state that would result in the application of
the laws of any other state or jurisdiction.

 



 

10.14.4 Each of the Parties hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any Action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) arising out of, or in any way relating to, this Agreement, any of
the Transactions, the Financing or the performance of services

 



      
 

 



 

thereunder or related thereto against any Financing Source in its capacity as
such, including any Action described in Clause 10.14.3 in any such court
described in Clause 10.14.3. It is expressly agreed that the Financing Sources
in their capacities as such shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Clause
10.14.4 and shall be entitled to enforce the provisions contained in this
Clause 10.14.4 as if they were a party to this Agreement. It is further
expressly agreed that the immediately preceding sentence of this Clause
10.14.4 shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such
state that would result in the application of the laws of any other state or
jurisdiction.

None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement shall survive the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement.
