ARTICLE 2 PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE SHARES

| 
---|--- 

2.1

|

Purchase and Sale of the Shares. 

On and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing,
Seller shall sell, and Purchaser shall purchase, all of Seller's right, title,
and interest in and to the Shares. Seller shall transfer and convey the Shares
and Purchaser shall purchase, the Shares free and clear of any and all Liens.

| 
---|--- 

2.2

|

Purchase Price. 

(a) The purchase price for the Shares shall be an amount equal to, without
duplication:

(i) €1,008,000,000 (the "Base Amount"); minus

(ii) the amount of Indebtedness; minus

(iii) the amount of Transaction Expenses; minus

(iv) the Warehouse Purchase Price; plus

(v) the amount of Cash;

the amount calculated pursuant to this sentence, the "Purchase Price".



(b) The Base Amount presented in paragraph (a) above is based on an assumption
that the EBITDA for the Company Group for the twelve months ended December 31,
2014 is equal to or greater than €101,500,000. In the event that the EBITDA
for the Company Group for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 as derived
from the 2014 Management Accounts (applying the Management Accounting
Principles) is less than €101,500,000, then the Base Amount shall be reduced
by an amount equal to 9.93 times the difference thereof, rounded up to the
nearest whole Euro (the "EBITDA Adjustment").

(c) In the event that the EBITDA for the Company Group for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2014 as derived from the 2014 Management Accounts (applying
the Management Accounting Principles) is greater than €101,500,000 (such
difference being the "Positive EBITDA Difference"), then any Shortfall Amount
that would otherwise be payable by Seller pursuant to Section 2.4(f) shall be
reduced by an amount equal to 9.93 times the Positive EBITDA Difference,
rounded up to the nearest whole Euro.

(d) Not later than the Marketing Commencement Date, Seller shall prepare and
deliver to Purchaser a statement, certified by an authorized signatory of the
Company (the "Estimated Purchase Price Statement"), setting forth Seller's
good faith estimate of the Purchase Price as of the Closing Date (the
"Estimated Purchase Price"), including the amount of the EBITDA Adjustment or
the Positive EBITDA Difference, if any, together with reasonable supporting
detail.

(e) After receipt of the Estimated Purchase Price Statement and prior to the
second Business Day prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Purchaser may
notify Seller in the event that it disputes any aspect of the Estimated
Purchase Price Statement and Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve such dispute. If Purchaser and Seller agree upon the amounts
set forth in the Estimated Purchase Price Statement, then the Estimated
Purchase Price set forth therein shall be deemed to apply for purposes of this
Agreement. If Purchaser and Seller fail to agree upon the amounts set forth in
the Estimated Purchase Price Statement at least one Business Day before the
anticipated Closing Date, neither Purchaser nor Seller shall delay the Closing
because of such failure to agree and the Estimated Purchase Price set forth in
the Estimated Purchase Price Statement delivered by Seller shall be deemed to
apply for purposes of this Agreement. However, the occurrence of the Closing
shall not constitute a waiver of Purchaser's right to proceed to the
determination procedure set out in Section 2.4.

2.3 Payment of Estimated Purchase Price.

(a) On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay (i) to Seller the Estimated
Purchase Price minus the Escrow Amount and minus €100,000,000, (ii) to Seller
the Parent Common Stock Consideration, (iii) to Baltissimmo NV the Warehouse
Purchase Price, (iv) to the Company, the amounts set forth on the Shareholder
Loan Payoff Letters (which the Company shall then immediately pay to the
holders of the Shareholder Loans), (v) to the Company, the amounts set forth
on the Payoff Letters (which the Company shall then immediately pay to the
holders of the Specified Indebtedness), and (vi) to the Escrow Agent the
Escrow Amount to be held and administered by the Escrow



Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. All such payments,
other than the Parent Common Stock Consideration, shall be wire transfers of
immediately available funds. Amounts with respect to Specified Indebtedness
that are stated in the Payoff Letters to be payable in United States dollars
shall be paid by Purchaser in United States dollars.

(b) Any payment to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds
pursuant to this Agreement by Purchaser shall be made to the bank accounts
nominated by Seller, such details to be provided by Seller in writing to
Purchaser at least three Business Days prior to the due date for payment.
Unless otherwise agreed by each Party in writing, any payments by wire
transfer under this Agreement shall be in immediately available funds in Euros
without any withholding (except as otherwise provided in accordance with
Section 3.5), set-off, deduction or counterclaim. All payments shall be made
by electronic transfer on the due date for payment and receipt of the amount
due shall be an effective discharge of the relevant payment obligation.

2.4 Post-Closing Adjustment.

(a) In the event that (i) Purchaser has timely notified Seller in accordance
with Section 2.2(e) that it disputes the Estimated Purchase Price Statement,
(ii) the Parties were unable to resolve the dispute prior to the Closing, and
(iii) provided that the amount by which Purchaser disputes the Estimated
Purchase Price exceeds an amount equal to 9.93 times the Positive EBITDA
Difference, as soon as is reasonably practicable after the Closing Date but
not more than 30 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to Seller a written statement showing in reasonable detail Purchaser's
computation of the Purchase Price (the "Adjustment Report") together with
reasonable supporting detail, which Adjustment Report shall be prepared in
accordance with this Agreement and the relevant Accounting Principles on a
basis consistent with that used in the preparation of the Financial Statements
and the Management Accounting Policies. All components of the Purchase Price
that can be derived from the 2014 Audited Financial Statements shall be
derived from the 2014 Audited Financial Statements without further adjustment
(it being understood that the EBITDA Adjustment is to be based on the
Management Accounting Principles and that the Transaction Expenses may reflect
expenses incurred after December 31, 2014). In the event that Purchaser has
not delivered to Seller an Adjustment Report in accordance with this Section
2.4 within the period of 30 days following the Closing Date, the Estimated
Purchase Price set forth in the Estimated Purchase Price Statement shall be
deemed final, conclusive and binding.

(b) Upon receipt of the Adjustment Report, Seller shall review the Adjustment
Report and shall promptly, but in any event within 30 days following such
receipt, notify Purchaser of any objection Seller has to Purchaser's
computation of the Purchase Price in the Adjustment Report by describing in
reasonable detail in a written notice to Purchaser (the "Objection Notice")
Seller's objection to Purchaser's computation of the Purchase Price. If Seller
does not deliver an Objection Notice within such 30 day period, then Seller
shall be deemed to have accepted the Adjustment Report, and the Purchase Price
set forth in the Adjustment Report shall be deemed final, conclusive and
binding. In the event of timely delivery of an Objection Notice, Seller and
Purchaser shall immediately



attempt, in good faith, to resolve all disputes between Seller and Purchaser
concerning any matter set forth in the Objection Notice within a period of 30
days (the "Negotiation Period").

(c) If Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree upon the Purchase Price during
the Negotiation Period, then Seller and Purchaser shall each nominate an
independent accounting firm (collectively, the "Independent Accounting
Firms"), which shall determine the Purchase Price. Purchaser and Seller shall
instruct the Independent Accounting Firms to deliver their written
determination to Seller and Purchaser no later than the 45th day following the
date on which the remaining differences are referred to the Independent
Accounting Firms or such other date as may be specified by the parties, which
written determination shall (i) be in accordance with (A) this Agreement
(including paragraph (a) above) and (B) to the extent not derivable pursuant
to clause (A), the Accounting Principles applied in a manner that is
consistent with that used in the preparation of the Financial Statements and,
in relation to the EBITDA Adjustment, the Management Accounting Principles,
(ii) be based solely on presentations and written submissions by Seller and
Purchaser to the Independent Accounting Firms, and not by independent review,
(iii) set forth in reasonable detail the basis for the Independent Accounting
Firms' final determination of the Purchase Price and (iv) absent manifest
error, be final, conclusive, non-appealable and binding on the Parties. In
determining each disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firms may not
assign a value to such item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either Seller or Purchaser or less than the lowest value for such
item claimed by either Seller or Purchaser. Seller and Purchaser shall make
available to the Independent Accounting Firms and to each other all relevant
books and records and working papers (including access to personnel at the
Company, Seller and Purchaser who prepared, or in the case of Seller reviewed,
the Adjustment Report) and all other items reasonably requested by the
Independent Accounting Firms. The fees and expenses (including VAT) of each
Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by the relevant instructing party.

(d) If the Independent Accounting Firms cannot resolve the remaining
differences within the period of 45 days referred to in Section 2.4(c), such
remaining differences shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the
dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 15.12 of this Agreement.

(e) If the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to this Agreement
exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price (the amount of such excess, the
"Additional Amount"), then within five Business Days following such
determination, Purchaser shall pay to Seller the Additional Amount by wire
transfer of immediately available funds without any withholding (except as
permitted by Section 3.5), set-off, deduction or counterclaim.

(f) If the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Purchase Price as finally
determined pursuant to this Agreement (the amount of such excess, the
"Shortfall Amount"), then Seller shall pay to Purchaser, within five Business
Days following such determination, an amount equal to (i) the Shortfall
Amount, minus (ii) an amount equal to 9.93 times the Positive EBITDA
Difference, rounded up to the nearest whole Euro (up to



the Shortfall Amount), by wire transfer of immediately available funds without
any withholding (except as permitted by Section 3.5), set-off, deduction or
counterclaim.

(g) All payments made by the Seller to Purchaser or by Purchaser to the Seller
under this Agreement, other than payments of interest, shall so far as
possible be made by way of adjustment to the Purchase Price.

(h) If any amount due for payment in accordance with this Agreement is not
paid on the due date for payment, the Person in default shall pay the Default
Interest on such amount from but excluding the due date to and including the
date of actual payment calculated on a daily basis.

4.8

Leased Property. 

(a) Schedule 4.8 sets forth all real property used or occupied by the Company
Group pursuant to Real Property Leases as of the date of this Agreement. The
Company or a Subsidiary has a valid and enforceable leasehold interest under
each of the Real Property Leases and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
has given or received any written notice, nor does the Company have Knowledge,
of any event which would entitle a landlord to terminate any Real Property
Lease or of any default or event, which, with notice or lapse of time, or
both, would constitute a default by the Company, a Subsidiary or the landlord
(or sub-landlord) under any of the Real Property Leases, except such defaults
that have not had and are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Without prejudice to the generality
of the foregoing, the Company and the Subsidiaries have quiet enjoyment and
undisturbed possession ("possession paisible") of all Leased Real Property.
The Company has provided to Purchaser in Folder 1.4 of the Data Room true and
complete copies of the Real Property Leases as in effect as of the date
hereof, together with all amendments, modifications, extensions or
supplements, if any, thereto, including any transfers, assignments or
subleases thereof to which the Company or a Subsidiary is a party.

(b) Each Real Property Lease is a legal, valid and binding obligation,
enforceable against the parties thereto in accordance with its terms. Neither
the Company nor any applicable leasing Subsidiary has leased, subleased,
licensed or otherwise assigned to or granted to anyone (other than the Company
or its applicable Subsidiary) the right to use or occupy the Leased Real
Property or any portion thereof. Neither the Company nor any applicable
leasing Subsidiary has received any written notice of any pending
condemnations, planned public improvements, annexation, special assessments,
zoning or subdivision changes, or violations or claimed violations of any Law,
or other adverse claims that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the ability to operate the Leased Real Property as currently operated.

(c) All Real Property Leases located outside of the United States are duly
registered ("enregistres") and, where appropriate in order to secure their
enforceability against Third Parties, recorded ("transcrits") with the
Mortgage Registrar ("Bureau de la conservation des hypotheques").

(d) The Company and the Subsidiaries have paid all material rents, expenses
and other amounts due by them prior to delinquency and they have otherwise
fulfilled all of their material obligations pursuant to the Real Property
Leases, the U.S. LVT Plant Development Authority Documents, and any applicable
Laws related thereto. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no events of
default, defaults or other circumstances that would permit the Development
Authority to provide a notice of default or otherwise exercise any remedies
under the U.S. LVT Plant Development Authority Documents and the Company has
no Knowledge of any circumstance that could result in an indemnification claim
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the U.S. LVT Plant
Development Authority Documents. Without limiting the foregoing, IVC US has
(i) made all required quarterly contributions accruing to date under the U.S.
LVT Plant Development Authority Documents to the Greater Dalton



Chamber of Commerce "Growth Greater Dalton 2.0" initiative which are required
to total $100,000 and which are payable in quarterly installments on each
January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15, beginning on January 15, 2014,
and (ii) properly and accurately prepared and filed on or before the
respective due dates thereof all "Annual Reports" required to be filed under
the Memorandum of Understanding attached to the Economic Development Agreement
(as defined under the U.S. LVT Plant Development Authority Lease). Such Annual
Reports have indicated that no "2009 Project Recovery Payments," "Expansion
Recovery Payments," or "Special Recovery Payments" (as those terms are defined
in the Memorandum of Agreement) were due or payable. IVC US has good,
marketable leasehold title to the U.S. LVT Plant, and neither the Company nor
IVC US have granted any Lien on the U.S. LVT Plant and to the Knowledge of the
Company, there is no Lien on the U.S. LVT Plant other than Permitted
Encumbrances.

(e) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has notified any landlord of its
intention to terminate any Real Property Lease prior to the end of its lease
term or to reduce the rentable area currently leased pursuant thereto. As at
the date of this Agreement, no landlord has notified the Company or any
Subsidiary in writing of its intention to terminate any Real Property Lease
prior to the end of its lease term or to reduce the rentable area currently
leased pursuant thereto.

4.9 Personal Property.

The Company or applicable Subsidiary possesses good and transferable title to
all of its owned Equipment, owned Vehicles, and other material items of owned
personal property free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted
Encumbrances.

4.10 Condition and Sufficiency of Assets.



The buildings, plants, structures, furniture, fixtures, machinery, equipment,
vehicles and other material items of tangible personal property currently
owned or leased by the Company Group are structurally sound, are in good
operating condition and repair (other than defects arising from normal wear
and operation), and are adequate for the uses to which they are being put. The
buildings, plants, structures, furniture, fixtures, machinery, equipment,
vehicles and other items of tangible personal property currently owned or
leased by the Company Group, together with all other properties and assets of
the Company Group, are sufficient in all material respects for the continued
conduct of the Business after the Closing in substantially the same manner as
conducted before the Closing; provided, however, that no representation is
made regarding Intellectual Property Rights, that being the subject of Section
4.12. None of the property contiguous to the Parcels owned by any member of
the Company Group is owned by any Related Person of any member of the Company
Group or the Seller.

applicable to the Benefit Plans. There are no actions (other than routine
claims for benefits) pending or, to the Knowledge of any member of the Company
Group or the Seller, threatened against the Company, any Subsidiary or any
Benefit Plan or its assets, or arising out of any of the Benefit Plans which

expected to result in material liability to the Company or any Subsidiary.

benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries.

401(a) and any trust maintained pursuant thereto has received a determination

the operations of the Benefit Plans which is reasonably likely to cause the
loss of such qualification or exemption.

arrangement" (as defined in ERISA Section 3(40)). Each of the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their ERISA Affiliates have not incurred and there are no
circumstances under which either could reasonably incur any liability under
Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

benefits under insured plans maintained by the Company or such Subsidiary (as

plans, (iii) coverage otherwise mandated by applicable Law, (iv) death

5.7 Financial Statements; Filings; No Undisclosed Liabilities.

(a) Parent has timely filed all SEC Documents required to be filed by Parent
since January 1, 2012 (together with all such SEC Documents filed, whether or
not required to be filed the "Parent SEC Reports"). The Parent SEC Reports (i)
at the time filed, complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Laws



and other applicable Laws and (ii) did not, at the time they were filed (or,
if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then
on the date of such filing or, in the case of registration statements, at the
effective date thereof) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated in such Parent SEC Reports
or necessary in order to make the statements in such Parent SEC Reports, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. To the
extent required by Securities Laws, each Parent SEC Report was accompanied by
the certificates required to be filed or submitted by Parent\'s chief
executive officer and chief financial officer pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and, at the time of filing or submission of each such certificate, such
certificate was true and accurate and complied in all material respects with
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. No member of the Parent Group other than Parent is
required to file any SEC Documents.

(b) Each of the Parent Financial Statements (including, in each case, any
related notes) contained in the Parent SEC Reports, including any Parent SEC
Reports filed after the date of this Agreement and prior to Closing, complied
as to form in all material respects with applicable Securities Laws and other
applicable laws, was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
to such financial statements or, in the case of unaudited interim statements,
as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), and fairly presented in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its subsidiaries as
at the respective dates and the consolidated results of operations and cash
flows for the periods indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial
statements were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments
which were not or are not expected to be material in amount or effect. Parent
maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15
under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports
that it is required to file or submit, or files or submits, under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.
Parent maintains internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal
control over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and
includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of Parent, (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and
expenditures of Parent are being made only in accordance with authorisations
of management and directors of Parent, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of Parent's assets that could have a material effect on its
financial statements. Parent has disclosed, based on the most recent
evaluation of its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer
prior to the date of this Agreement, to Parent's auditors and the audit
committee of Parent's board of directors (A) any significant deficiencies in
the design or operation of its internal controls over financial reporting that
are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent's ability to record, process,
summarise and report



financial information and has identified for Parent's auditors and audit
committee of Parent's board of directors any material weaknesses in internal
control over financial reporting and (B) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Parent's internal control over financial reporting.

(c) Since January 1, 2012 through the date of this Agreement, (i) neither
Parent nor any of its subsidiaries nor any director, officer, employee,
auditor or accountant of Parent or any of its subsidiaries has received any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
that Parent or its subsidiaries have engaged in illegal or fraudulent
accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Parent or
any of its subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries, has reported to the board of directors of Parent or any
committee thereof or to any director or officer of Parent any evidence of a
material violation of Securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation, relating to periods after January 1, 2012, by Parent or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents. To the Knowledge of the executive
officers of Parent there are no SEC inquiries or investigations, other
governmental inquiries or investigations pending or threatened, in each case
regarding any accounting practices of Parent or any of its subsidiaries or any
malfeasance by any executive officer of Parent.

(d) There are no outstanding or unresolved comments from any comment letters
received by Parent from the SEC relating to any of the Parent SEC Reports. To
the Knowledge of the executive officers of Parent, none of the Parent SEC
Reports is the subject of any ongoing review by the SEC.

(e) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the New York Stock
Exchange (the "NYSE"). Parent has not, in the preceding twelve months,
received notice from the NYSE to the effect that Parent is not in compliance
with the listing or maintenance requirements of the NYSE. Parent is, and,
assuming the consummation of the Proposed Transactions, has no reason to
believe that it will not in the foreseeable future continue to be, in
compliance with all such listing and maintenance requirements.

(f) To the knowledge of the executive officers of Parent, none of Parent or
any of its subsidiaries has any material Liabilities other than Liabilities
that are reflected in the financial statements included in the Parent SEC
Reports prior to the date of this Agreement, were incurred in the ordinary
course of business since January 1, 2014, or that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect
on the business, results of operations or financial condition of Parent and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

5.8 No Further Representations.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article 5 or any other provision of
this Agreement, it is the explicit intent of each Party that each of Parent
and Purchaser is not making any representation or warranty whatsoever, express
or implied, except those



representations and warranties set forth in this Article 5, and in entering
into this Agreement Seller expressly acknowledges and agrees that (i) it is
not relying on any statement, representation or warranty other than those
representations and warranties set forth in this Article 5, and (ii) none of
the Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective Related Persons or
Representatives shall have or be subject to any liability to Seller or any
other Person resulting from or in connection with the dissemination to Seller
or any other Person, or the use by Seller or any other Person of any such
information, including any information made available in connection with or
expectation of the entry into this Agreement or the Proposed Transactions
other than to the extent addressed in a representation, warranty or covenant
set forth in this Agreement and other than in the case of fraud. This Section
5.8 shall survive the Closing indefinitely.

matter hereafter arising or discovered by Seller that, if existing or Known by
the Company on the date hereof, would have been required to be disclosed on a
Schedule to this Agreement in order for the representations and warranties

as of a specific date or time period) to be true in all material respects (or
in the case of the Fundamental Representations (other than any Fundamental
Representation that speaks as of a specific date or time period) true in all
respects) as of the date hereof and (B) with respect to the representations
and warranties in Article 4 that speak as of a specific date or time period,
any matter hereafter discovered by Seller that was existing as of such

actions shall include furnishing all information and documents required by
applicable Law in connection with approvals of or filings with any
Governmental Authority with regulatory jurisdiction over enforcement of any
applicable Antitrust Laws ("Governmental Antitrust Authority"), including

its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
filings and other documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all
necessary Consents of all Third Parties and Governmental Authorities necessary
or advisable for it to consummate the Proposed Transactions. In the event that
the Parties receive a Second Request for additional information under the HSR
Act the Parties will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
respond to such Second Request as promptly as practicable and counsel for both
Parties will closely cooperate with each other during the entire Second
Request review process.

(c) Each Party shall have the right to review and comment upon in advance, and
to the extent practicable each will consult the other Parties on, in each case
subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, all the
information relating to Parent, Purchaser, Seller or the Company Group, as the
case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or other written materials
submitted to, any Third Party or Governmental Authority in connection with the
Proposed Transactions. Each Party shall have the right to participate in any
meetings or conferences with any Governmental Authority, subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of Purchaser and Seller shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. Purchaser and Seller agree that they will keep the other apprised
of the status of matters relating to completion of the Proposed Transactions,
including, subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
promptly furnishing the other with copies of notice or other communications
received by Parent, Purchaser, Seller or the Company Group, as the case may
be, from any Third Party or Governmental Authority with respect to the
Proposed Transactions.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither Parent nor
Purchaser shall have any obligation to propose or agree to accept any
undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make any
divestiture, to accept any operational restriction, or take any other action
that, in the reasonable commercial judgment of Parent and Purchaser, could be
expected to limit the rights of Parent and Purchaser or their Related Persons
to own or operate all or any portion of their respective businesses or assets.
With regard to any Government Authority, none of the Seller, any of its
Related Persons, nor the Company, shall without Purchaser's written consent,
to be given in Purchaser's sole discretion, discuss or commit to any
divestiture transaction, or discuss or commit to alter their businesses or
commercial practices in any way, or otherwise take or commit to take any
action that limits Parent's or Purchaser's freedom of action with respect to,
or Parent's or Purchaser's ability to retain any of the businesses, product
lines or assets Parent and Purchaser are acquiring in this Agreement or
otherwise receive the full benefits of this Agreement.



6.5 Access to Properties, Books and Records.

access, upon reasonable notice during normal business hours to all properties,
books, records and key management personnel of or pertaining to the Company
and its Subsidiaries to the extent reasonably required to facilitate
integration activities; provided, however, that the foregoing will not: (i)
materially interfere with the day-to-day operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; and (ii) require Seller, the Company or any Subsidiary to
provide access or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would contravene any Law or contract, or would relate to commercially
sensitive information, or would result in the waiver of any legal privilege or
work-product protection. Any information disclosed will be subject to the
provisions of Section 11.1. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall not
conduct any sampling or other intrusive investigation of air, surface water,
groundwater or soil at or in connection with any property associated or
affiliated in any way with the Company Group without the prior written
approval of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed. Any sampling activity by Purchaser shall in no way materially
interfere with or disrupt the business and operations of the Company Group.
Subject to the proviso to the first sentence of this Section 6.5, and subject
to the second sentence of this Section 6.5, from the date of this Agreement
until the earlier of termination of this Agreement or the Closing, Seller
shall, and shall cause the Company Group to, cooperate with reasonable

preparation with respect to ownership and operation of the Company Group
following the Closing, including with respect to, among other things, systems
integration and product development. Subject as aforesaid, Seller shall also
provide to Purchaser and Parent, within thirty days of the date hereof, a

obligations or liabilities to the Company Group's employees under the WARN Act
for actions occurring prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall take all
actions required by and bear sole responsibility for any obligations or

occurring on or following the Closing Date.



6.7 Payment of Indebtedness by Related Persons.

Except with respect to the Shareholder Loans which, together with the
Specified Indebtedness, shall be repaid at Closing, and as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, Seller will cause all Indebtedness owed to the

Section 6.7 shall not include the Company or its Subsidiaries) to be paid in
full prior to Closing.

6.8 Release of indemnities, etc.

Purchaser shall procure that as from Closing Seller and its Related Persons
(which term as used in this Section 6.8 shall not include the Company or its

of the Company Group, and pending such release Purchaser shall indemnify and
hold harmless Seller against all liabilities under those guarantees and
indemnities.

6.9 Further Assurances.

Subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement, each of the Parties
hereto will use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to take all
actions and to do all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Proposed Transactions (including satisfaction, but not waiver, of the
conditions to Closing set forth in Article 7 (in relation to all Parties),
Article 8 (in relation to Seller) and Article 9 (in relation to Purchaser)).

6.10 Parent Covenant.

From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date or the
termination of this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly contemplated
herein, Parent covenants and agrees that it shall conduct its business and the
business of its subsidiaries in a manner designed in its reasonable judgment,
to preserve intact the Parent Group\'s core businesses and goodwill.

transactions contemplated herein.

6.12 Employees and Benefit Plans.

(a) From the Closing until the 12 month anniversary of the Closing, Purchaser
shall provide to those employees of the Company Group as of immediately prior
to the closing (the "Continuing Employees" ) compensation and benefits that
are substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided to similarly-
situated employees of the Purchaser, except where Law or existing contractual
arrangements require that Purchaser



provides compensation and benefits no less favorable in the aggregate to those
provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to Closing, and
provided that Purchaser may, in its discretion but subject to Law and existing
contractual arrangements, choose to continue the compensation and benefit
arrangements as in effect for Continuing Employees immediately prior to
Closing where such continuation is permitted by Law, and provided further that
Purchaser may, in its discretion but subject to Law and existing contractual
arrangements, choose to alter the compensation and benefits package to meet
changes in applicable Laws, and, more in particular, to phase out
discriminations as contemplated under current or future equal treatment laws.
During such 12 month period, Purchaser shall provide Continuing Employees with
no less favorable severance benefits that they would receive under the Benefit
Plans and Non-U.S. Benefit Plans immediately prior to Closing (to the extent
such Benefit Plans and Non-U.S. Benefit Plans are disclosed in the Data Room).
Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of employment for any
employee of the Company Group, or other than as provided in any applicable
employment agreement or other contract, to restrict the right of the Purchaser
to terminate the employment of any such employee. The terms and conditions of
employment for the US-based employees of the Group Companies as of the Closing
who are represented by a union and who continue with the Purchaser shall be
governed by the applicable collective bargaining agreement.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan in which any Continuing
Employees first become eligible to participate at or after the Closing (the
"New Company Plans" ), Purchaser and Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
Employees of the Company Group or under any health and welfare New Company
Plans in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Closing
to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
were waived or otherwise satisfied under a corresponding Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) cause deductibles, coinsurance or
maximum out-of-pocket payments made by such employees during the applicable
plan year in which such employee first participates in the applicable New
Company Plan to reduce the amount of deductibles, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket payments under the New Company Plans to the extent taken account
under the corresponding Benefit Plan or Non-U.S. Benefit Plan in respect of
the same plan year; and (iii) recognize service credited by the Company Group
prior to the Closing for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting
credit (and, for purposes of severance and paid time off only, for purposes of
determining the amount or level of benefit) in any New Company Plan in which
such employees may be eligible to participate after the Closing; provided,
however, that in no event shall any credit be given to the extent it would
result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

(c) Except as expressly provided herein, nothing contained in this Agreement,
whether express or implied, shall (i) be treated as an amendment or other
modification of any Benefit Plan or Non-U.S. Benefit Plan or (ii) limit the
right, subject to the applicable Laws, of Purchaser to amend, terminate or
otherwise modify any Benefit Plan or Non-U.S. Benefit Plan following the
Closing, (iii) confer upon any Person whether or not a



party to this Agreement any right to employment, any right to compensation or
benefits, or any other right of any kind or nature whatsoever.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the members of
the Company Group, in their sole discretion, shall be permitted to (i) prior
to the Closing, pay out bonuses for any completed fiscal year to their
employees in the Ordinary Course of Business and (ii) on the Closing and with
the consent of Purchaser, not to be unreasonably withheld, pay to each
eligible employee a pro rata bonus in respect of the Company's then current
fiscal year through the Closing based on the Company Group's determination, in
good faith (and in consultation with the Purchaser), of the amounts earned,
based on actual performance through the Closing, provided that such amounts in
this clause (ii) are included as Transaction Expenses.

(e) If Purchaser so requests no later than ten days before the Closing Date,
subject to applicable Law, the terms and conditions of the applicable Benefit
Plans, any collective labor agreements and contingent on Closing, Seller shall
take all actions necessary to terminate any group 401(k) plans, including any
participant notice requirements and including documenting such actions through
resolution of the appropriate board or committee of Seller or the Company
Group, in each case with effect as of the day immediately prior to the Closing
Date. No later than the date immediately prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall provide Purchaser with evidence that the board of directors of the
applicable plan sponsor has passed resolutions to terminate each applicable
group benefit plan identified above with effect at the Closing Date. Purchaser
shall have the ability to review and consult with Seller in relation to the
form and substance of such resolutions, and Seller shall take into account
Purchaser's reasonable comments.

(f) Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate using commercially reasonable efforts
and in good faith to ensure that the following items are resolved prior to the
Closing Date: (1) to the extent 401(k) ADP/ACP discrimination tests have not
been passed for any of the prior three plan years, the Company Group shall
take all actions necessary to ensure any corrective refunds have been
processed and that, if deemed reasonably necessary by Purchaser, a corrective
filing under the Internal Revenue Service's voluntary correction program is
properly made; and (2) to the extent Form 5500 filings for the 2013 plan year
with respect to U.S. group welfare plans have not been timely filed, the
Company Group shall take all actions necessary to ensure that corrective
filings under the Department of Labor's Delinquent Filer Voluntary Compliance
Program are made.

6.13 Tax Matters.

Except as required by applicable Law or Taxing Authority practice, from the
date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, without the prior written consent
of Purchaser (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), none
of Seller, the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries shall make or change any
election, change an annual accounting period, adopt or change any Tax or
accounting method or system of internal accounting control, file any amended
Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement, settle any Tax



claim or assessment relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
surrender any right to claim a refund of Taxes, consent to any extension or
waiver of the limitation period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment
relating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or take any similar action
relating to the filing of any Tax Return or the payment of any Tax, if such
election, adoption, change, amendment, agreement, settlement, surrender,
consent or other action would have the effect of materially increasing the Tax
liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any period ending
after the Closing Date or materially decreasing any Tax attribute of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries existing on the Closing Date.

6.14 Financing.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser and Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary financing for the Purchase Price
and its other payment obligations hereunder (including with respect to the
repayment of the Specified Indebtedness and the Shareholder Loans (including
Shareholder Loan Interest), and the Warehouse Purchase Price) hereunder in a
timely manner (including alternative financing if the contemplated bond
financing is not available) and Seller shall, and shall cause the Company
Group to, use commercially reasonable best efforts to provide to Purchaser, at
Purchaser's sole expense, cooperation reasonably requested by Purchaser in
order for Purchaser to obtain financing for any portion of the Purchase Price
and such other payment obligation hereunder provided, however, that (A)
nothing in this Section 6.14 shall require any cooperation to the extent that
it would unreasonably interfere in any material respect with the business or
operations of Seller or its Related Persons, (B) none of Seller or its Related
Persons shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur
any other liability or obligation in connection with the Purchaser Financing
and (C) none of Seller or its respective Related Persons shall be required to
execute or deliver any document, including any agreement, instrument,
guaranty, warranty, indemnity or certificate, that is not contingent upon the
Closing or that would be effective prior to Closing. Purchaser and Parent
shall promptly, upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller and its
Representatives for all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred by Seller or its Representatives in connection with
the cooperation contemplated by this Section 6.14(a). All non-public
information regarding Seller and its respective Representatives provided to
Purchaser, Parent or their Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.14(a)
shall be kept confidential by them in accordance with Article 11, except for
disclosure to potential lenders or investors as required in connection with
any such financing subject to customary confidentiality provisions. Purchaser
and Parent agree that any breach of this Section 6.14(a) shall not constitute
a breach of this Agreement that gives rise to or contributes to any failure of
a condition set forth in Article 7 or Article 8 to be satisfied.

(b) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that obtaining the financing is not a
condition to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt and regardless of whether
Purchaser and Parent have complied with their obligations set out in Section
6.14(a), if the financing (whether bond financing or alternative financing)
has not been obtained, Purchaser shall continue to be obligated, subject to
the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 7 and Article
8, to complete the Proposed Transactions on



the terms contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent shall continue to be
obligated in accordance herewith.

(c) Purchaser and Parent shall, and shall procure that their Representatives
shall, cooperate with and provide such information and take such steps as may
reasonably be requested by Seller or the holders of Specified Indebtedness in
order to obtain the Payoff Letters and to discharge the Specified Indebtedness
at the Closing, including satisfaction of such holders' anti-money laundering
procedures.

6.15 Title Insurance.

Seller shall on or prior to the Closing Date deliver (or cause the Company,
its applicable Subsidiary or their respective officers to deliver) such
documents and instruments as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser or
Purchaser's title company, including without limitation affidavits of title
(such as non-imputation affidavits) and such other documentation in such forms
reasonably required by the title company in order to issue (i) an extended
coverage owner\'s policy of title insurance with respect to any U.S. Real
Property (or, as the case may be, date down endorsements to existing owner's
policies), and (ii) an extended coverage leasehold owner's policy of title
insurance with respect to the U.S. LVT Plant (or, as the case may be, date
down endorsements to existing owner's policies). Such title insurance policies
shall be issued at Purchaser's sole cost and expense, and, except as
explicitly provided herein, Seller shall have no obligations with respect to
the issuance of such title insurance policies (for the avoidance of doubt,
Seller shall have no obligation to cause the title company to remove any
exception to its existing title insurance policies or the title insurance
policies to be issued at Purchaser\'s request).

6.16 Transition Services Agreement with Baltisse.

The Parties agree to negotiate in good faith during the period from the date
of this Agreement to the Closing Date to enter into a transition services
agreement regarding the provision of ICT desktop services by IVC NV (or such
other Group Company as Seller and Purchaser may agree) to Baltisse NV after
the Closing.

6.17 Restructuring.

At or prior to the Closing, Seller (i) shall have caused the Other Shareholder
to transfer its Shares in the Company to Seller, (ii) shall have taken such
actions necessary to exercise and acquire the shares resulting from the
exercise of all outstanding stock options in the Company or any Subsidiary,
and (iii) shall have, and shall have caused the Company to, take all such
actions necessary to ensure that each member of the Company Group is wholly-
owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company as of the Closing Date, other
than with respect to class A shares in Avelgem held by certain residents of
Avelgem, Belgium (the transactions described in this Section 6.17, the
"Restructuring").

8.1 Representations and Warranties.

Each of the representations and warranties made by Seller in Article 4 shall

correct only as of such specific date or in respect of such specific period,
and (ii) may be untrue or incorrect as a result of actions or transactions
expressly permitted by the Purchase Documents or actions or transactions of
Seller made with the prior written consent of Purchaser or Parent), provided
that for purposes of this Section 8.1, if any representation or warranty made
by Seller (other than a Fundamental Representation) includes within its terms
a materiality qualifier, such qualifier shall be disregarded solely for
purposes of determining compliance with this Section 8.1; provided, further,
that for purposes of this Section 8.1, this condition shall be deemed to have
been satisfied unless the failure of any such representation and warranty
(other than



a Fundamental Representation) to be true and correct on and as of the Closing
Date, or on and as of the specific date (or specific period) that such
representation and warranty is made, as applicable, would have a Material
Adverse Effect.

Seller shall have duly performed in all material respects all of the
covenants, agreements, obligations and conditions contained in this Agreement

ARTICLE 10 POST-CLOSING MATTERS

10.1 Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation.

(a) Until the expiration of three years after the Closing Date (the
"Restricted Period"), each of (i) Balcaen, individually, and (ii) Seller (on
behalf of itself and on behalf of its Related Persons, but excluding for the
avoidance of any doubt the Company Group) agrees that it will not, in any
manner (whether on its own account, or as an owner, operator, manager,
consultant, officer, director, employee, investor, agent or otherwise),
anywhere in the United States, the European Union, Russia and the Ukraine
(together, the "Restricted Territory"), engage in the Business, or own any
interest in, manage, control, participate in (as an owner, operator, manager,
consultant, officer, director, employee, investor, agent or representative),
or consult with or render services for any Person that is engaged in the
Business; provided, however, that no owner of less than 5% of the outstanding
stock of any publicly-traded company shall be deemed to engage solely by
reason thereof in the Business. Nothing in this Section 10.1 shall be deemed
to require Seller to restrict any activities of any Person that Seller does
not control or with respect to which Seller has existing contractual or legal
obligations limiting Seller's discretion to impose on such Person obligations
such as those in this Section 10.1, provided that such contractual or legal
obligations have been disclosed to Purchaser and Parent in the Disclosure
Schedule as of the date of this Agreement. This Section 10.1 shall not apply
to Balcaen's or Seller's and its Related Persons' interests in Balta, on the
condition that during the Restricted Period (i) neither Balcaen nor Seller and
its Related Persons shall increase any of their respective ownership stakes in
Balta as compared to the date hereof, and (ii) none of Balcaen or Seller or
its Related Persons shall take any action to manage, control, participate in
(as an operator, consultant, officer, director, manager, employee, agent or
representative), or consult with or render services to Balta with respect to
the Business (provided that, notwithstanding the above, being a manager
(gerant) of Balta shall not in and of itself be prohibited under this Section
10.1).

(b) Balcaen and Seller (including its Related Persons) each agree that it will
not, during the Restricted Period, in any manner (whether on his, her or its
own account, as an owner, operator, manager, consultant, officer, director,
employee, investor, agent or otherwise), (i) call upon, solicit or provide
services to any customer of the Company as of the date hereof with the intent
of selling or attempting to sell any Business products or Business services,
(ii) hire or engage or recruit, solicit or otherwise attempt to employ or
engage any Person employed or engaged by the Company or any Subsidiary, or
induce or attempt to induce any Person to leave such employment or engagement
(provided that general advertising of vacancies and positions shall not be
prohibited), or (iii) in any way intentionally prejudice the relationship
between the Company or any Subsidiary and any employee, customer, sales
representative, broker, supplier, licensor, licensee or other material
business relation (or any prospective customer, supplier, licensor, licensee
or other business relationship) of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries
(including by making any negative or disparaging statements or communications
regarding the Company or any Subsidiary).



(c) The Parties specifically acknowledge and agree that in the event that
either Balcaen or Seller breaches this Section 10.1, Parent and Purchaser
shall have the right to seek specific performance from or injunct such
breaching party from violating this Section 10.1 and to have the restrictions
set forth in this Section 10.1 specifically enforced by the tribunal having
jurisdiction to decide on this matter. Such rights and remedies shall be in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to
Parent and Purchaser at law, and in particular the right to seek compensation
for the damage suffered as a consequence of the breach of this Section 10.1.
Balcaen and Seller each understand and agree that, if the Parties become
involved in legal action regarding the enforcement of this Section 10.1 and if
Parent or Purchaser prevails in such legal action, Parent or Purchaser, as
applicable, will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy, to recover from
Balcaen or Seller, as appropriate, its reasonable costs and attorneys' fees
incurred in enforcing such covenants.

(d) Balcaen and Seller each acknowledge that the provisions of this Section
10.1 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of
Parent and Purchaser. However, if any of the provisions of this Section 10.1
are held by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to exceed
any limitation imposed by the applicable law (in particular, but not solely,
the limitations in duration, geographic area or personal and material scopes),
such provisions shall not be declared null and void but the Parties shall be
deemed to have agreed to such provisions as confirm with the maximum permitted
by the applicable Law, and any provision of this Section 10.1 exceeding such
limitations shall be automatically amended accordingly. Provided that
Purchaser has complied with its obligations hereunder to pay the Purchase
Price, to repay the Specified Indebtedness and the Shareholder Loans
(including Shareholder Loan Interest), and to pay the Warehouse Purchase
Price, the existence of any other claim or other cause of action by Seller
against the Company Group or Purchaser Group, whether predicated on this
Agreement or otherwise, will not constitute a defense to the enforcement by
Parent or Purchaser of the provisions of this Section 10.1, which section will
be enforceable upon payment of the Purchase Price and such other aforesaid
payment obligations notwithstanding the existence of any breach by Parent or
Purchaser.

| 
---|--- 

10.2

|

Retention of Records. 

(l) Purchaser shall retain, and cause the Company Group after the Closing to
retain, all Books and Records which are in the Company Group's possession or
control at the Closing relating to the Benefit Plans or accounting or legal
matters prior to the Closing for a period of at least seven years from the
date hereof or such further period as may be required by any applicable Law in
effect as of the date of this Agreement or that may be enacted thereafter;
provided, however, that at the end of such seven-year or applicable longer
period the Books and Records may be disposed of by Purchaser or the Company
Group, if Purchaser or the Company Group first offers to surrender possession
thereof to Seller at Seller's expense. After the Closing Seller shall have the
right during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice to Purchaser or the
Company Group, to inspect and make copies of books and records of the Company
Group for any reasonable purpose including the preparation of Tax Returns and
other Governmental Authority filings, the preparation of financial statements
and the defending of claims.



(b) Seller may retain (i) one copy of the materials included in the Data Room
organized by Seller in connection with the purchase and sale of the Shares,
together with a copy of all documents referred to in such materials, (ii) all
internal correspondence and memoranda, valuations, investment banking
presentations and bids received from others in connection with the sale of the
Shares, and (iii) a copy of all consolidating and consolidated financial
information and all other accounting records prepared or used in connection
with the preparation of the Financial Statements.

| 
---|--- 

10.3

|

Further Assurances. 

Seller agrees from time to time after the Closing Date, at Purchaser\'s
request, to execute, acknowledge, and deliver to Purchaser such other
instruments of conveyance and transfer and will take such other actions and
execute and deliver such other documents, certifications, and further
assurances as Purchaser may reasonably require in order to vest more
effectively in Purchaser, or to put Purchaser more fully in possession of, any
of the Company's rights or assets. Each of the Parties hereto will cooperate
with the other and execute and deliver to the other Parties hereto such other
instruments and documents and take such other actions as may be reasonably
requested from time to time by any other Party hereto as necessary to carry
out, evidence, and confirm the intended purposes of this Agreement. Each Party
shall bear its own costs and expenses in compliance with this Section 10.3.

| 
---|--- 

10.4

|

Quitus. 

Within five Business Days following the Closing Date Purchaser shall procure
(i) that a resolution of the general meeting (or as the case may be sole
shareholder) of each member of the Company Group is duly (and, in the case of
multiple shareholders, unanimously) passed granting full discharge (quitus, or
the equivalent concept in other jurisdictions) to the outgoing members of the
board of each such member of the Company Group for their conduct up to the
Closing Date, and (ii) shall repeat such discharge at the occasion of the next
general meeting/sole shareholder resolution approving the annual accounts of
the relevant member of the Company Group, provided, however, that such
discharge to the outgoing members of the board of each such member of the
Company Group shall in both cases be granted subject to all matters which may
give rise to any finding of liability in accordance with applicable Law of
such members of the board of each member of the Company Group and which have
not been disclosed to the Purchaser prior to the Closing Date. Copies of all
such resolutions shall be promptly provided to Seller.

ARTICLE 11 CONFIDENTIALITY; PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS

| 
---|--- 

11.1

|

Confidentiality. 

(a) Until the third anniversary of (i) the Closing Date or (ii) the date of
termination of this Agreement, Purchaser will, and will cause its directors,
officers, Representatives and Related Persons to, hold in confidence, and not
disclose to any Person (other than as permitted by this Section 11.1), any
Confidential Information;



provided, however, that for Confidential Information that is a trade secret
under applicable Law, for so long as such Confidential Information remains a

(b) Until the third anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller will, and will
cause its directors, officers, Representatives and Related Persons to, hold in

Confidential Information that is a trade secret under applicable Law, for so

Law, Seller will, and will cause its directors, officers, Representatives and
Related Persons to, hold in confidence, and not disclose to any Person (other
than as contemplated by this Section 11.1), any such Confidential Information.

(c) This Section 11.1 shall not prevent disclosure by a Party or its
Representatives to the extent that: (i) disclosure is required by Law or by
any Governmental Authority (including any Taxing Authority) having applicable
jurisdiction (provided that the disclosing party shall first, to the extent
reasonably practicable and permitted by Law, inform the other party of its
intention to disclose such Confidential Information and take into account the
reasonable comments of the other party), (ii) disclosure of Confidential
Information that was lawfully in the possession of such Party or any of its

approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(b) The restriction in Section 11.2(a) shall not apply to the extent the
public announcement is required by Law or any Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that the party making the
announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other
party in advance as to its form, content and timing.

on the other;

(b) by Parent and Purchaser if any condition in either of Article 7 or Article

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article 13, from and after the
Closing Seller agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Purchaser
Indemnitees from and against, any and all Losses resulting from or arising out
of:



(a) the failure of any representation or warranty of Seller contained in or
made pursuant to this Agreement to be true and correct as of the date such

reference to the materiality of matters stated therein or as to matters having
or not having a "Material Adverse Effect" shall be disregarded.

| 
---|---

|

Agreement of Purchaser and Parent to Indemnify.

breach of which will be determined with reference to such specified date); and

(b) the breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser or Parent contained
in or made pursuant to the Purchase Documents.

| 
---|--- 

13.3

|

Procedures for Indemnification. 

(a) An Indemnification Claim shall be made by the Indemnitee by delivery of a
written declaration to the Indemnitor requesting indemnification and
specifying in reasonable detail the basis on which indemnification is sought
and the amount of asserted



Losses and, in the case of a Third Party Claim, containing (by attachment or
otherwise) such other information as the Indemnitee shall have concerning such
Third Party Claim (an "Indemnification Claim Notice").

(b) If the Indemnification Claim involves a Third Party Claim, the procedures
set forth in Section 13.4 hereof shall be observed by the Indemnitee and the
Indemnitor.

(c) If the Indemnification Claim involves a matter other than a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnitor shall have 30 Business Days following receipt of the
Indemnification Claim Notice to object to such Indemnification Claim by
delivery of a written notice of such objection to the Indemnitee specifying in
reasonable detail the basis for such objection. Failure to timely so object
shall constitute a final and binding acceptance of the Indemnification Claim
by the Indemnitor and the Indemnification Claim shall be paid in accordance
with Section 13.3(d) hereof. If an objection is timely interposed by the
Indemnitor, then the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor shall negotiate in good
faith for a period of 60 Business Days from the date (such period is
hereinafter referred to as the "Claim Resolution Period") the Indemnitee
receives such objection. After the Claim Resolution Period, if the Indemnitor
and the Indemnitee still cannot agree on the amount of an Indemnification
Claim, either the Indemnitor or the Indemnitee may submit the dispute
concerning such Indemnification Claim for resolution as provided in Section
15.12 below; provided, however, nothing herein shall prevent the Parties from
seeking interim or injunctive relief with respect to such dispute.

(d) Upon determination of the amount of an Indemnification Claim that is
binding on both the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee, the Indemnitor shall pay
the amount of such Indemnification Claim (i) if such amount is due from the
Seller, from the Escrow Amount or, if the Escrow Amount has been released from
escrow or otherwise exhausted, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
within five Business Days of the date such amount is determined, or (ii) if
such amount is due from the Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds within five Business Days of the date such amount is
determined.

| 
---|--- 

13.4

|

Defense of Third Party Claims. 

(a) In the event of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall have ten
Business Days from receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim to notify each
Indemnitor thereof in writing by providing an Indemnification Claim Notice.
The right of an Indemnitee to be indemnified under this Article 13 in respect
of a Third Party Claim shall not be adversely affected by a failure to provide
such Indemnification Claim Notice unless, and then only to the extent that, an
Indemnitor is prejudiced thereby.

(b) The Indemnitor shall have ten Business Days (or such lesser time as may be
necessary to comply with statutory response requirements for litigation claims
that are included in such Third Party Claims) from receipt of the
Indemnification Claim Notice to notify in writing the Indemnitee of whether or
not the Indemnitor will, at its sole cost and expense, defend the Indemnitee
against such Third Party Claim.



(c) In the event that the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee within the ten
Business Day period that it chooses to defend the Indemnitee against such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor will defend the Indemnitee by appropriate
proceedings, which proceedings shall be promptly settled or prosecuted by the
Indemnitor to a final conclusion in such a manner as to minimize the risk of
the Indemnitee becoming subject to Liability for any other significant matter.
If the Indemnitee desires to participate in, but not control, any such defense
or settlement, it may do so at its sole cost and expense. If any such Third
Party Claim or the litigation or resolution of any such Third Party Claim
involves a claim for equitable relief, then the Indemnitee shall have the
right to control the defense or settlement of any such Third Party Claim or
demand and its reasonable costs and expenses shall be included as part of the
indemnification obligation of the Indemnitor. If the Indemnitee should elect
to exercise such right, the Indemnitor shall have the right to participate in,
but not control, the defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim at its
sole cost and expense.

(d) In the event that the Indemnitor fails to provide a written response to
Indemnitee with respect to such Indemnification Claim Notice within the ten
Business Day period, the Indemnitee shall have the right to control the
defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim, provided, that the Indemnitor
shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the defense or
settlement of such Third Party Claim at its sole cost and expense and provided
further that the Indemnitee shall not settle any such Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(e) The Indemnitee and the Indemnitor shall cooperate with each other in all
reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim,
including making available records relating to such claim and furnishing,
without expense to the Indemnitor, management employees of the Indemnitee as
may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of any such
claim or for testimony as witness in any proceeding relating to such claim.

Settlement of Third Party Claims. 

No settlement of a Third Party Claim involving the asserted Liability of the
Indemnitee under this Article 13 shall be made without the prior written
consent by or on behalf of the Indemnitee, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Consent shall be presumed in
the case of settlements of €150,000 or less where the Indemnitee has not
responded within 20 Business Days of written notice of a proposed settlement.
Any settlement of a Third Party Claim shall include an unconditional release
of the Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such asserted liability.

Duration. 

All representations and warranties of Seller set forth in this Agreement shall
remain operative and in full force and effect until the date that is 18 months
after the Closing (the "Release Date") except that (i) the Fundamental
Representations shall



survive indefinitely, (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 4.20 shall survive until 60 days after the date upon which the right
of the Taxing Authorities or any other competent authorities to assess or
claim any Taxes in respect of the matters giving rise to such an
Indemnification Claim is barred by the relevant statute of limitation, and
(iii) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.13 shall
survive until the date that is five years after Closing, and for the avoidance
of doubt no Indemnification Claim may be made for any breach of such
representations and warranties following the expiration of the applicable
period. All representations and warranties of Purchaser and Parent set forth
in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect until
the Release Date, (and for the avoidance of doubt no Indemnification Claim may
be made for any breach of such representations and warranties following the
Release Date), except the representations and warranties of Purchaser and
Parent set forth in Sections 5.1, 5.3 and 5.5 which shall survive
indefinitely. All covenants of the Parties shall survive in accordance with
their respective terms.

13.7 Limitations and Exclusions.

(a) The Indemnitor shall be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee only when
the aggregate of all Losses suffered or incurred by the Indemnitee as to which
a right of indemnification is provided under Section 13.1(a) or 13.2(a)
exceeds €7,500,000 (the "Threshold Amount"). After the aggregate of all Losses
suffered or incurred by the Indemnitee exceeds the Threshold Amount, the
Indemnitor shall be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee for the amount of
such Losses that exceed the Threshold Amount. In no event shall the aggregate
Liability of Seller, or the aggregate Liability of Parent and Purchaser, under
this Article 13 exceed €75,000,000 (the "Maximum Amount"). Furthermore, no
claim for a Loss may be made for indemnification hereunder if the amount of
such claim does not exceed €150,000 (the "De Minimis Amount"). Notwithstanding
the above, neither the Threshold Amount, the Maximum Amount nor the De Minimis
Amount limitations shall apply to the indemnification rights of the Parties
hereto for Losses resulting from (i) fraud, (ii) breach of the Fundamental
Representations, (iii) the Tax Indemnity, or (iv) Sections 13.1(c), 13.1(d),
13.1(e), 13.1(f) and 13.1(g), and the payment of such amounts by the
Indemnitor shall not count toward the calculation of the Maximum Amount of the
Indemnitor.

(b) The amount of Losses for which indemnification is available under this
Article 13 shall be reduced by any Tax Benefits actually recognized in the tax
period in which the Losses are sustained or paid by the Indemnitee arising
from the circumstances giving rise to the claim for Losses.

(c) No Party will in any event be liable under this Article 13, and no claim
for indemnification may in any event be asserted under this Article 13, for
any exemplary, punitive, special, consequential, incidental or indirect
Losses, other than to the extent such Losses shall have been awarded to a
third party with respect to a matter otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Indemnitee shall be
entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under any provision of this
Agreement for



any amount to the extent such Person or its Related Person has been
indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any other provision of a
Purchase Document. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any
fact, circumstance or condition forming a basis for a claim for
indemnification under this Article 13 or Article 14 shall overlap with any
fact, circumstance, condition, agreement or event forming the basis of any
other claim for indemnification under this Article 13 or Article 14, or any
deduction from the Base Amount pursuant to Section 2.2, there shall be no
duplication in the calculation of the amount of the Losses (or, in the case of
Article 14, Taxes).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller shall
not be liable for any Losses to the extent the matter or circumstance giving
rise to the indemnification is reflected in calculating the Purchase Price,
nor shall the Seller be liable for any Losses (except with respect to any
amount subject to the Tax Indemnity, arising from the representations and
warranties under Section 4.20 or indemnifiable under Sections 13.1(c),
13.1(d), 13.1(e), 13.1(f) and 13.1(g)) to the extent the matter or
circumstance giving rise to the indemnification, was included on the face of
the Financial Statements or in a footnote thereto, or was disclosed in a
Disclosure Schedule.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein and for the
avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not be liable for any Losses (including Taxes
and other Losses otherwise indemnifiable under Article 14), to the extent (i)
such Losses would not have arisen but for any winding-up, a change in the
operation of the Company Group by Purchaser or its or Parent's Related Person
after the Closing Date, reorganization or change in ownership of any member of
the Purchaser Group after the Closing Date or (ii) such Losses arose or were
increased as a direct or indirect result of any change in Law occurring after
the Closing Date.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall
not have any liability for any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation
or warranty made by Seller or the Company to the extent that either Purchaser
or Parent had actual knowledge at or before the date hereof that such
representation or warranty was breached or inaccurate, provided that (i)
Seller shall bear the burden of proof in showing that Purchaser or Parent had
actual knowledge at or before the date hereof that such representation or
warranty was breached or inaccurate, and (ii) this clause (g) shall not apply
to Seller's indemnification obligations under the Tax Indemnity, Sections
13.1(c), 13.1(d), 13.1(e), 13.1(f) and 13.1(g) and any Loss arising from the
breach of representations and warranties under Section 4.20.

(h) Each Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
their respective Losses (including for the avoidance of doubt Taxes and other
Losses otherwise indemnifiable under Article 14) upon and after becoming aware
of any event or condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder. An Indemnitor shall have no
liability for any portion of such Losses that reasonably could have been
avoided had the Indemnitee made such efforts.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall
not be liable for (i) any deferred Tax liabilities included in the Financial
Statements,



calculated consistently with past practices, or in a footnote thereto, or (ii)
for Taxes which were caused by the actions following the Closing of Purchaser,
Parent and their Related Persons, except where such actions were (i) taken by
any such person with the mutual approval and cooperation of Seller to engage
in regularizations for value-added tax and transfer-pricing purposes as
permitted by applicable Law or (ii) otherwise required by applicable Law.

13.8 Insurance and Third Party Recovery.

The amount of Losses for which indemnification is available under this Article
13 or Article 14 shall be calculated net of any amounts recovered or
recoverable by Indemnitee under insurance or otherwise from third parties with
respect to such Losses.

13.9 Subrogation Rights.

In the event that the Indemnitor shall be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnitee pursuant to this Article 13, the Indemnitor shall, upon payment of
such indemnity in full, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitee with
respect to the Losses to which such indemnification relates; provided,
however, that the Indemnitor shall only be subrogated to the extent of any
amount paid by it pursuant to this Article 13 in connection with such Losses
and shall not be entitled to make any claim under any insurance policy of the
Company or any other Indemnitee.

13.10 Exclusive Remedy.

Except as provided in Article 14, the Parties covenant and agree that, from
and after the Closing, the remedies provided for in this Article 13 shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for all Losses that any Indemnitee
may suffer or incur arising from, or directly or indirectly relating to, the
Company Group, this Agreement or the Proposed Transactions, and the Parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waive any other rights or remedies (whether at law
or in equity and whether based on contract, tort, statute or otherwise) that
they may otherwise have had, now have or may in the future have against any of
the other Parties or any of the respective direct or indirect Related Persons,
officers, managers, directors, employees, advisors, shareholders, members,
consultants, investment bankers, brokers, controlling persons, partners,
managers or other representatives or agents thereof (each of whom shall be an
express third-party beneficiary hereof) arising from, or directly or
indirectly relating to, the Company Group, this Agreement or the Proposed
Transactions and covenant not to sue or otherwise assert any claim (or assist
any other Person in suing or otherwise asserting any claim) encompassed by the
foregoing covenants, agreement and waiver; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not apply to claims of fraud, and provided, further, that the
foregoing shall not limit the Parties' rights to specific performance as
contemplated by Section 15.15 with respect to covenants to be performed after
the Closing pursuant to this Agreement (but shall apply to any monetary
damages in connection with any failure to perform or breach thereof). Any
Person who is sued or otherwise has a claim asserted against him, her or it in
violation of this Section 13.10 may enforce it directly as an express third-
party beneficiary thereof.



ARTICLE 14 TAX MATTERS

14.1 Tax Matters.

(a) Seller shall from and after the Closing indemnify the Company, its
Subsidiaries and the Purchaser and hold them harmless from and against
(without duplication): (i) all Taxes (and Losses, if any, resulting from the
non-payment thereof) of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Taxable
periods ending on or before December 31, 2014 and the portion through the end
of December 31, 2014 for any Taxable period that includes (but does not end
on) December 31, 2014 ("Pre-December 31 Tax Period"), (ii) all Taxes of any
member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary group or fiscal unity
of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of any of
the foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the December 31, 2014,
including pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous
or similar state, local, or foreign Law or regulation, (iii) any and all Taxes
of any person (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) imposed on the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by contract
or pursuant to any law, rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or
transaction occurring before the Closing, (iv) any Tax arising out of or
relating to the Restructuring, (v) all Taxes arising from the termination of
any fiscal unity or other group or unity as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (vi) all Taxes arising from the transfer of
the Warehouse as provided in Section 2.5, and (vii) any loss of deferred tax
assets, provided that in each of (i) through (v) the obligation of Seller to
indemnify shall not apply until Tax (and the related Loss, if any) becomes due
and payable. From and after the Closing Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for
any Taxes that have become due and payable of the Company or its Subsidiaries
that are the responsibility of Seller pursuant to this Section 14.1(a) within
15 Business Days after written notice of payment of such Taxes by Purchaser,
the Company or its Subsidiaries. All such reimbursements shall be made by
electronic transfer in immediately available funds and receipt of the amount
due shall be an effective discharge of the relevant reimbursement obligation.
Such indemnity provided under this Section 14.1(a) shall be referred to herein
as the "Tax Indemnity." For the avoidance of doubt, if a Tax both is included
in the Tax Indemnity and arises from a breach of a tax representation or
warranty under Section 4.20, that Tax is to be covered by this Section 14.1
and not Section 13.1.

(b) In the case of any Taxable period that includes (but does not end on)
December 31, 2014 (a "Straddle Period"), (i) the amount of any Taxes based on
or measured by income or receipts of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
Pre-December 31 Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of
the books as of the close of business on December 31, 2014 (and for such
purpose, the Taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest shall
be deemed to terminate at such time) and (ii) the amount of other Taxes of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period which relate to the Pre-
December 31 Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire Taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Taxable period ending on December 31, 2014 and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.



(c) Seller and Purchaser agree to treat the payment of an Indemnification
Claim or Tax Indemnity hereunder as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for
federal, state, local and foreign income tax purposes. If, notwithstanding the
treatment required by the preceding sentence, the payment of an
Indemnification Claim or Tax Indemnity hereunder is determined to be taxable
to the party receiving such payment by any Taxing Authority, the paying party
shall also indemnify the party receiving such payment for any Taxes incurred
by reason of the receipt of such payment and any expenses incurred by the
party receiving such payment in connection with such Taxes (or any asserted
deficiency, claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding, judgment or assessment,
including the defense or settlement thereof, relating to such Taxes).

(d) Purchaser shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) all
Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries which are required to be
filed after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall permit Seller to review and
comment on each Tax Return relating to a Pre-December 31 Tax Period prior to
filing, and any such comments shall be provided to Purchaser no later than ten
days prior to the due date for such Tax Return. Purchaser shall incorporate
any reasonable comments to such Tax Returns.

(e) With regard to cooperation on tax matters from and after the Closing:

(i) Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and Seller shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 14.1 and
any audit, Litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Party\'s request)
the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any
such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, from and after the Closing the Company and its Subsidiaries,
Purchaser, Parent and Seller agree (A) to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating
to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration
of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Purchaser or
Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing
Authority, and (B) to give the other Party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the
other Party so requests, the Company and its Subsidiaries, Purchaser, Parent
or Seller, as the case may be, shall allow the other Party to take possession
of such books and records.

(ii) Purchaser, the Company and Seller further agree, upon request, to use
their commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including, but not limited to, with respect to the Proposed Transactions).



(iii) Purchaser, the Company and Seller further agree, upon request, to
provide the other party, or any Related Person of either party, with all
information that either party, or a Related Person of either party, may be
required to report pursuant to Code Section 6043 and all Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder.

(f) All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements between on the one hand
one or more members of the Company Group and on the other hand Seller and its
Related Persons (excluding the Company Group), shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

(g) All transfer, documentary, deed recording, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other such Taxes, and all conveyance and notarial fees, recording charges
and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with consummation of the Proposed Transactions shall be paid by
Purchaser when due, and Purchaser will, at its own expense, file all necessary
Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes, fees and
charges, and, if required by applicable law, Seller will, and will cause its
Related Persons to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall pay all such Taxes
and all conveyance and notarial fees, recording charges and other fees and
charges (including any penalties and interest and the cost of filing all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes,
fees and charges) from the transfer of the Warehouse as provided in Section
2.5, and, if required by applicable law, Buyer will, and will cause its
Related Persons to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.

14.2

Audits and Other Proceedings. 

(a) Following the Closing Date, if an audit or other administrative or
judicial proceeding is initiated by any Taxing Authority with respect to Taxes
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for which Seller would be liable
pursuant to Section 13.1 or 14.1, Purchaser or the Company, as the case may
be, shall within 15 Business Days notify Seller in writing of such audit or
proceeding. Failure to give such notice shall not relieve Seller from any
indemnification obligation which it would have with respect to Section 13.1 or
14.1, except to the extent that Seller is actually prejudiced thereby. Seller
will have the right, at its option and its expense, to control the conduct of
all stages of any audit or other administrative or judicial proceeding with
representatives of its own choosing with respect to Taxes of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries for which Seller would have an indemnification obligation
under Section 13.1 or 14.1, provided, however, Seller shall allow the Company
and its counsel to participate in any audit or other administrative or
judicial proceeding to the extent that such Taxes relate to the Company and
its Subsidiaries. At such time as such request is received by Purchaser,
Purchaser or the Company, as the case may be, will furnish Seller and/or its
Representatives with powers of attorney or any other documentation or
authorization necessary or appropriate to enable Seller and/or its
Representatives to control the conduct of such audit or other proceeding.
Purchaser shall control the conduct of all stages of all



other audits or other administrative or judicial proceedings with respect to
Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Purchaser and the Company
shall not, and shall not permit any of their Related Persons to, accept any
proposed adjustment or enter into any settlement or agreement in compromise
regarding any Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for which Seller
would have an indemnification obligation under Section 13.1 or 14.1 without
the express written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.



(b) With respect to any audit or other administrative or judicial proceeding
from and after the Closing that it controls, Seller (x) shall give prompt
notice to Purchaser of any Tax adjustment proposed in writing pursuant to any
audit or other administrative or judicial proceeding controlled by Seller with
respect to the assets or activities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and (y) shall not accept any proposed adjustment or enter into any settlement
or agreement in compromise which would bind Purchaser or the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries with respect to any Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries
(other than any such Taxes for which Seller would have an indemnification
obligation under Section 13.1 or 14.1) without the express written consent of
Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

14.3

|

Carrybacks. 

Seller shall be entitled to the benefit of any refund for any Tax attributable
to a Pre-December 31 Tax Period and Purchaser shall and shall procure that the
Company Group shall use commercial best efforts to obtain any such refund that
may be available and, if any such amounts are received by Parent, Purchaser,
the Company Group or their Related Persons, Purchaser shall within 15 Business
Days from such receipt pay such amount to Seller by wire transfer in
immediately available funds without any withholding (except as otherwise
provided in accordance with Section 3.5), set-off, deduction or counterclaim,
except that any refund of any Tax (or reduction in Tax liability) resulting
from a carryback of a post-acquisition Tax attribute (including net operating
losses and credits) of any of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall inure to
the benefit of Purchaser, and if any such amounts are received by Seller,
Seller shall within 15 Business Days from receipt pay such amount to Purchaser
by wire transfer in immediately available funds without any withholding, set-
off, deduction or counterclaim. All payments shall be made by electronic
transfer and receipt of the amount due shall be an effective discharge of the
relevant payment obligation.

This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder may not be assigned
unless (a) such assignment is consented to in writing by both Purchaser and
Seller, or (b) Parent or Purchaser assigns its rights, in whole or in part, to
a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, but in the case of

15.4 No Benefit to Others.

The representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements contained in this
Agreement are for the sole benefit of the Parties hereto and, in the case of
Article 13 hereof, Purchaser Indemnitees, Seller Indemnitees and Persons
referred to in the final sentence of Article 13, and their respective heirs,
executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns, and
they shall not be construed as conferring any Third Party beneficiary or any

shall be deemed and construed to include any other number, singular or plural,
and any other gender, masculine, feminine, or neuter, as the context requires.

(b) Neither this Agreement nor any uncertainty or ambiguity herein shall be
construed or resolved against Parent, Purchaser or Seller, whether under any

considered the draftsman. On the contrary, this Agreement has been reviewed,
negotiated and accepted by all Parties and their attorneys and shall be

15.7

|

Actions of the Company. 

Whenever this Agreement requires the Company to take any action or to refrain
from taking any action, such requirement shall be deemed to involve, (i) with
respect to actions to be taken, or not to be taken, at or prior to the
Closing, an undertaking on the part of Seller to cause the Company to take
such action or to refrain from taking such action, as applicable, to the
extent Seller has the requisite authority to so do, and (ii) with respect to
actions to be taken, or not to be taken, following the Closing, an undertaking
on the part of Purchaser to cause the Company to take such action or to
refrain from taking such action, as applicable, to the extent the Purchaser or
Parent have the requisite authority to so do.

15.8 Integration of Agreement.

(a) This Agreement, the Schedules, the Exhibits, the Disclosure Schedule, the
other Purchase Documents and any other legally-binding written agreement
entered into by the Parties on the date of this Agreement constitute the
entire agreement among the Parties relating to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements, oral and written, between the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality
Agreement.

(b) Neither this Agreement, nor any provision hereof, may be amended except
with an agreement in writing signed by all Parties. Neither this Agreement,
nor any provision hereof, may be waived, discharged or supplemented orally,
but only by an agreement in writing signed by the Party against which the
enforcement of such waiver, discharge or supplement is sought. The failure or
delay of any Party at any time or times to require performance of any
provision of this Agreement shall in no manner affect its right to enforce
that provision. No single or partial waiver by any Party of any condition of
this Agreement, or the breach of any term of this Agreement or the inaccuracy
or warranty of this Agreement, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or
more instances shall be construed or deemed to be a further or continuing
waiver of any such condition, breach or inaccuracy or a waiver of any other
condition, breach or inaccuracy.

15.9 Waiver.

The rights and remedies of the Parties to this Agreement are cumulative and
not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any Party in exercising
any right, power,



or privilege under this Agreement or the Purchase Documents will operate as a
waiver of such right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise
of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further
exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right,
power, privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) no
claim or right arising out of this Agreement or the Purchase Documents can be
discharged by one Party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of
the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other Party; (b) no waiver
that may be given by a Party will be applicable except in the specific
instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one Party
will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such Party or of the right
of the Party giving such notice or demand to take further action without
notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the Purchase Documents.

Time of Essence. 

 

Time is of the essence in this Agreement.

15.11 Governing Law.

This Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in
connection with it shall be governed by, and shall be construed in accordance
with, the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

15.12 Arbitration of Disputes.

(a) All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be
exclusively and finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the
International Chamber of Commerce by three arbitrators appointed in accordance
with the said Rules. The seat of the arbitration shall be Luxembourg and the
language of the proceedings shall be English.

(b) This Section 15.12 does not exclude the right of any Party to apply for
interim relief before any court having jurisdiction.

(c) This Section 15.12 shall also apply to disputes arising out of or in
connection with other Purchase Documents, unless the relevant agreement or
document provides otherwise.

(d) Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing, the Parties shall keep
confidential all matters relating to the arbitration or the award, including
all documents or testimony disclosed by the Parties during the proceedings,
subject to applicable Law, and except as necessary to protect or pursue a
legal right or to enforce or challenge an award in bona fide legal
proceedings.

15.13 Partial Invalidity.

Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in
such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but in case any
one or more of



the provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to
be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal,
or unenforceable provision or provisions had never been contained herein
unless the deletion of such provision or provisions would result in such a
material change as to cause completion of the Proposed Transactions to be
unreasonable. To the extent the deemed deletion of the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision or provisions is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect, the Parties shall endeavor in good faith to replace the
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the
economic effect of which comes as close as practicable to that of the invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provisions.

15.14 Investigation.

Purchaser acknowledges that it has been given such access to the premises,
books, records and Representatives of the Company Group and has had the
opportunity to review such other data and other information with respect
thereto as Purchaser has deemed necessary in its sole judgment to evaluate the
Proposed Transactions. Purchaser acknowledges that none of Seller, the Company
Group or any of their respective Representatives assumes any responsibility
for the accuracy or adequacy of any information heretofore or hereafter
furnished to Purchaser by or on behalf of the Company Group except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement. Purchaser agrees to accept the
Company in the condition it is in on the Closing Date based upon its own
analysis and determination with respect to all matters, and without reliance
upon any express or implied representations or warranties of any nature made
by or on behalf of or imputed to Seller or the Company Group, except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Purchaser understands that any cost estimates, revenue, earnings or
cash flow projections or other predictions of future financial performance
(excluding the EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2014) that have been
provided to Purchaser by or on behalf of Seller are not and shall not be
deemed to be representations or warranties of Seller, the Company, their
Representatives or any other Person. Purchaser acknowledges that (i) there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and
other predictions, (ii) Purchaser is familiar with such uncertainties, (iii)
Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other predictions so
furnished and (iv) under no circumstances shall Purchaser have any claim
against Seller, the Company Group or any of their respective Representatives
with respect thereto.

15.15 Specific Performance.

The Parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy would exist and
damages would be difficult to determine. Therefore, it is accordingly agreed
that each Party hereto shall be entitled to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of any other Party, and appropriate injunctive relief



shall be granted in connection therewith. Any party seeking an injunction, a
decree or order of specific performance shall not be required to provide any
bond or other security in connection therewith and any such remedy shall be in
addition and not in substitution for any other remedy to which such party is
entitled.

15.16 Parent and Purchaser.

In addition to the obligations of Parent under this Agreement and the other
Purchaser Documents, Parent hereby:

(a) guarantees to Seller the payment when due of all amounts payable by
Purchaser under or pursuant to this Agreement and the other Purchase
Documents;

(b) undertakes to ensure that Purchaser will perform when due all its
obligations under or pursuant to this Agreement and the other Purchase
Documents;

(c) agrees that if and each time Purchaser fails to make any payment when it
is due under or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Purchase Document,
Parent shall on demand (without requiring Seller first to take steps against
Purchaser or any other person) pay that amount to Seller as if it were the
principal obligor in respect of that amount by wire transfer of immediately
available funds within five Business Days of the date such amount is
requested; and

(d) agrees as principal debtor and primary obligor to indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Related Persons against all Losses sustained by them
flowing from any non-payment or default of any kind by Purchaser under or
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Purchase Document.
