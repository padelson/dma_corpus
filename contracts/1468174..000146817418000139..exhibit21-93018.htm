with GAAP consistent with the past practice of the Company and, solely to the
extent not addressed by GAAP, in accordance with the example set forth in
Exhibit B hereto.

(b) Upon delivery of the items set forth in Section 2.06(a), the Company shall
provide the Purchaser with reasonable access during normal business hours to
the Books and Records and other materials of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and the personnel of, and work papers (subject to the execution of customary

for, the Company, the Sellers and their respective Representatives, in each
case to the extent applicable to such items, and the Company shall work in
good faith and reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser to resolve any
objections or comments that the Purchaser may have with respect to the matters
set forth therein, and the parties shall make any adjustments to such matters
to the extent mutually agreed. In the event that the Estimated Closing Working
Capital is greater than the Target Working Capital, then the Purchase Price
payable to NewCo by the Purchaser at the Closing shall be increased by the
amount by which the Estimated Closing Working Capital exceeds the Target
Working Capital. In the event that the Estimated Closing Working Capital is
less than the Target Working Capital, then the Purchase Price payable to NewCo
by the Purchaser at the Closing shall be decreased by the amount by which the
Target Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Closing Working Capital.

Section 2.07 Post-Closing Adjustment to Purchase Price. The Closing Purchase
Price shall be subject to adjustment after the Closing as follows:

(a) As soon as practicable, but no later than ninety (90) days following the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall prepare in good faith and deliver to the
Sellers' Representative (each of which shall be accompanied by appropriate
information and documentation supporting the applicable calculation):

(i) an unaudited balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the

practice of the Company (the "Closing Balance Sheet");

(ii) a schedule of the Company Indebtedness as of immediately prior to the
Closing (the "Closing Company Indebtedness");

(iii) a schedule of the Cash and Cash Equivalents as of immediately prior to
the Closing ("Closing Cash and Cash Equivalents"); and

(iv) a statement of Working Capital, which shall set forth a reasonably
detailed calculation by the Purchaser of Working Capital as of the Closing
Date based on the Closing Balance Sheet (the "Closing Working Capital").

Any actions taken by the Purchaser at or after the Closing shall not be taken
into account for the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Working Capital.

(b) The Purchaser shall deliver a copy of the Closing Balance Sheet, the
Closing Company Indebtedness and Closing Cash and Cash Equivalents and the
calculation of the Closing Working Capital (together, the "Closing Financial
Data") to the Sellers' Representative promptly after it has been prepared
together, which Closing Financial Data shall be prepared in accordance with
the applicable definitions contained herein and in accordance with GAAP
consistent with the past practice of the Company and, solely to the extent not
addressed by GAAP, in accordance with the example set forth in Exhibit B
hereto.

(c) After receipt of the Closing Financial Data, the Sellers' Representative
shall have sixty (60) days (the "Review Period") to review the Closing
Financial Data, together with the work papers used in the preparation thereof,
and have its Representatives review such Closing Financial Data. In connection
with the review of the Closing Financial Data, the Purchaser shall give, and
shall cause the Company and its Representatives to give, to the Sellers'
Representative and its Representatives such access during normal business
hours to the Books and Records and other materials of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the personnel of, and work papers prepared by or for, the
Purchaser, the Company and their respective Representatives (in each case,
subject to execution of customary access letters and confidentiality
undertakings), including to such historical financial information relating to
the Company and its Subsidiaries as the Sellers' Representative or its
Representatives may reasonably request, in each case, to the extent reasonably
necessary to permit the timely and complete review of the Closing Financial
Data in accordance with this Section 2.07(c).

(d) If the Sellers' Representative has accepted such Closing Financial Data in
writing or has not given written notice addressed and delivered to the
Purchaser setting forth any objection to such Closing Financial Data (a
"Statement of Objections") prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then
such Closing Financial Data shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the
Purchaser and the Sellers. In the event that the Sellers' Representative
delivers a Statement of Objections during the Review Period (which statement
must describe in reasonable detail (including all supporting calculations and
references identifying all relevant schedules and documents) the items
contained in the Closing Financial Data with which the Sellers' Representative
disagrees and the basis for such disagreement), the Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to agree on the
amount of Closing Working Capital, Cash and Cash Equivalents or Company
Indebtedness as of immediately prior to the Closing, as applicable, and
appropriate adjustments to the Closing Balance Sheet within thirty (30) days
following the receipt by the Purchaser of the Statement of Objections;
provided, however, that the Statement of Objections may only include
objections based on (i) the failure of the calculations set forth in the
Closing Financial Data to be prepared in accordance with the applicable
definitions contained herein and in accordance with GAAP consistent with the
past practice of the Company and, solely to the extent not addressed by GAAP,
in accordance with the example set forth in Exhibit B hereto or (ii)
mathematical errors in the computation of any amount set forth in the Closing
Financial Data. Any written and executed resolution by the Purchaser and the
Sellers' Representative during the thirty (30) days after receipt by the
Purchaser of the Statement of Objections shall be final, conclusive and
binding. If the Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative are unable to reach
an agreement as to such amounts and adjustments within such thirty (30) day
period, then solely the matters set forth in the Statement of Objections that
remain in dispute shall be submitted as promptly as practicable to BDO USA,
LLP, or if BDO USA, LLP is unwilling or unable to serve in such capacity, to
such other independent accounting firm agreed to by the Purchaser and the
Sellers' Representative (such firm, the "Accounting Firm"), who shall resolve
the matters still in dispute and adjust the Closing Financial Data to reflect
such resolution; provided, however, that the Accounting Firm may not determine
an amount of (w) Closing Working Capital in excess of that claimed by the
Sellers' Representative or less than that claimed by the Purchaser, (x) Cash
and Cash Equivalents as of immediately prior to the Closing in excess of that
claimed by the Sellers' Representative or less than that claimed by the
Purchaser or (y) Company Indebtedness as of immediately prior to the Closing
in excess of that claimed by the Purchaser or less than that claimed by the
Sellers' Representative. The Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall
cause the Accounting Firm to make such determination within forty-five (45)
days following the submission of the matter to the Accounting Firm for
resolution, and such determination shall be final, conclusive and binding upon
the Purchaser and the Sellers (absent fraud or manifest error) and may be
entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. The Purchaser and the
Sellers' Representative shall instruct the Accounting Firm to (A) review only
those unresolved items specifically set forth in the Statement of Objections
and submitted to the Accounting Firm in the amounts claimed by the Purchaser
and the Sellers' Representative in the Closing Financial Data and the
Statement of Objections, respectively, (B) make its determination based solely
upon the written submissions of the Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative
(i.e., not by independent review) and (C) limit its review to whether the item
in dispute is (x) calculated in accordance with the applicable definitions
contained herein and in accordance with GAAP consistent with the past practice
of the Company and, solely to the extent not addressed by GAAP, in accordance
with the example set forth in Exhibit B hereto or (y) a mathematical error.
Each of the Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative agree that it shall not
have any right to, and shall not, institute any Action of any kind challenging
such determination or with respect to the matters that are the subject of this
Section 2.07, except that the foregoing shall not preclude an Action to
enforce such determination. The terms "Final Closing Working Capital," "Final
Closing Cash and Cash Equivalents" and "Final Closing Indebtedness" shall
mean, respectively, the definitive Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash and
Cash Equivalents and Closing Indebtedness agreed to (or deemed to be agreed
to) by the Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative or the definitive Closing
Financial Data resulting from the determinations made by the Accounting Firm
in accordance with this Section 2.07 (in addition to those items theretofore
agreed to (or deemed agreed to) by the Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative).

(e) In the event any dispute is submitted to the Accounting Firm for
resolution as provided in Section 2.07(d), the fees, charges and expenses of
the Accounting Firm shall be allocated and paid by the Purchaser, on the one
hand, and/or the Sellers, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which
the portion of the dispute not awarded to each party bears to the amount
actually contested by such party. For example, if the Sellers' Representative
claims that the appropriate adjustments are $1,000 greater than the amount
determined by the Purchaser, and if the Accounting Firm ultimately resolves
the dispute by awarding to the Sellers' Representative $300 of the $1,000
contested, then the fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be
allocated 30% (i.e., 300 ÷ 1,000) to the Purchaser and 70% (i.e., 700 ÷ 1,000)
to the Sellers.

(f) Promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) following the
determination of the Final Closing Working Capital, Final Closing Cash and
Cash Equivalents and Final Closing Indebtedness pursuant to this Section 2.07,
(i) if the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, the Purchaser shall pay to NewCo
an aggregate amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified in writing by the
Sellers' Representative at least one (1) Business Day prior to the payment
date, and (ii) if the Net Adjustment Amount is negative, NewCo shall, and the
Sellers shall cause NewCo to, pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to the
absolute value of the Net Adjustment Amount, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account specified in writing by the Purchaser at least
one (1) Business Day prior to the payment date.

Section 2.08 Withholding. The Purchaser, the Company and their Affiliates and
agents (each, a "Payor") shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (a) from the
payment in respect of any LTIP Award or other compensatory payments pursuant
to or in connection with this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or any other applicable Law relating to any Tax and (b) from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may
be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under Sections 1445 or 1446 of the Code as a result of Seller's
failure to deliver the documentation required pursuant to Section 2.04(e). No
other deduction or withholding in respect of any Taxes shall be made from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, nor shall
Purchaser establish any reserve on the Closing Balance Sheet in connection
therewith, unless (x) such additional withholding is required as a result of a
change in applicable Law after the date of this Agreement or (y) the Purchaser
and the Sellers' Representative, acting in good faith, agree that such
additional withholding is required under applicable Law. The Sellers'
Representative and the applicable Payor agree to cooperate and use
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any anticipated withholding Tax
imposed in connection with the transactions contemplated herein. To the extent
that amounts are deducted, withheld and paid over to the relevant Governmental
Authority in accordance with this Section 2.08, such deducted and withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

regardless of form, whether in money, property, gifts or services, to any
Government Official or Governmental Body in order to obtain, retain or direct

Company from (i) declaring and paying any dividends or distributions of, or
otherwise transferring to the Sellers and their Affiliates, Cash and Cash
Equivalents or (ii) engaging in the Restructuring Transactions.

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the Purchaser, directly or
indirectly, any rights to control or direct the Company's operations prior to
the Closing. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision
of their respective operations.

Section 6.02 Access to Information; Preservation of Records.

(a) Subject to Section 6.03, prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall be
entitled, through its officers, employees and Representatives, to reasonable
access during normal business hours to the officers, employees, agents and
Representatives and offices of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective Books and Records (including such financial and accounting
information as the Purchaser reasonably requests); provided, however, that
such access shall be subject to any applicable Laws relating to privacy or
data protection and shall only be upon reasonable notice, shall not
unreasonably disrupt personnel, operations and properties of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and shall be at the Purchaser's sole risk and expense. In
exercising its rights hereunder, the Purchaser shall conduct itself so as not
to unreasonably interfere in the conduct of the Business prior to the Closing.
The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that any contact or communication by the
Purchaser and its agents and Representatives with officers, employees, agents
or Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries hereunder shall be
arranged and supervised by Representatives of the Company, unless the Company
otherwise expressly consents in writing with respect to any specific contact.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of
the Sellers' Representative, the Sellers, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be required to disclose to the
Purchaser or any agent or Representative thereof any information (i) relating
to any sale process conducted by the Sellers, the Company or any of their
Affiliates for the Business or the Sellers', the Company's or any of their
Affiliates' (or their Representatives') evaluation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection therewith, including projections, financial or
other information relating thereto or (ii) if doing so would violate any
Contract or Law to which the Sellers, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates is a party or is subject or which such Person
believes in good faith would reasonably be expected, based on the advice of
outside counsel, to result in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a
claim of privilege (including without limitation, the attorney-client and work
product privileges) (provided that, in the case of this clause (ii), the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide such access as can be provided (or otherwise find alternative means to
convey such information regarding the applicable matter as can be conveyed)
without violating such privilege, Law or Contract). Prior to the Closing, the
Purchaser shall not (and shall cause its Representatives and agents not to)
use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.02(a) for any purpose
unrelated to the Transactions.

(b) After the Closing, upon reasonable written notice addressed and delivered
to the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the
Sellers' Representative, the Sellers and each of their respective
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to such
information and the Books and Records relating to the Business and/or the
Company and its Subsidiaries as is necessary for the preparation and filing of
any Tax Return, the defense of any Tax claim or assessment, in connection with
the defense of any Action, any insurance claims by, legal proceedings against
or governmental investigations of the Sellers, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the Purchaser or any of their Affiliates (in each case, other
than an Action arising out of this Agreement or related to the Transactions);
provided, however, that such access shall be subject to any applicable Laws
relating to privacy or data protection and shall only be upon reasonable
notice, shall not unreasonably disrupt personnel, operations and properties of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, and shall be at the Sellers and the Sellers'
Representatives' sole risk and expense. In exercising its rights hereunder,
each Seller and the Sellers' Representative shall conduct itself so as not to
unreasonably interfere in the conduct of the Business. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Purchaser,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be
required to disclose to the Sellers, the Sellers' Representative or any agent
or Representative thereof any information if doing so would violate any
Contract or Law to which the Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates is a party or is subject or which such Person
believes in good faith would reasonably be expected, based on the advice of
outside counsel, to result in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a
claim of privilege (including without limitation, the attorney-client and work
product privileges) (provided that, in such event, the Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide such access as can be provided (or
otherwise find alternative means to convey such information regarding the
applicable matter as can be conveyed) without violating such privilege, Law or
Contract).

(c) Subject to Section 10.02, the Purchaser shall preserve and keep the books,
records, documents, instruments, accounts, correspondence, writings, evidences
of title and other papers and electronic files relating to the Business and/or
the Company and its Subsidiaries in its possession or the possession of the
Company (the "Books and Records") for at least six (6) years following the
Closing Date or for such longer period as may be required by Law or any
applicable court order.

Section 6.03 Confidentiality; Non-Solicitation.

(a) The Purchaser and its Representatives (as such term is defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement), on the one hand, and the Sellers, the Company and
their respective Representatives (as such term is defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement), on the other hand, shall treat all nonpublic
information obtained in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
(including the entering into of this Agreement and the Transactions) as
confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.
The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby incorporated by
reference and shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at
which time such Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. If this Agreement
is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms.

(b) For a period of three (3) years following the Closing, the Purchaser
shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, keep confidential
and not use for any purpose all nonpublic information regarding the Sellers'
Representative, the Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the Company and
its Subsidiaries) of which the Purchaser or the Company became aware as a
result of the Transactions (i) unless such information becomes available to
the general public through no act or omission of the Purchaser, the Company or
its Subsidiaries in breach of this Agreement, (ii) is or becomes available to
the Purchaser, the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates on
a non-confidential basis from a source who is not, to the Knowledge of the
Purchaser, subject to a confidentiality or similar agreement, duty or
obligation prohibiting such disclosure, (iii) was independently developed
without the use of such confidential information by the Purchaser, the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates after the Closing or
(iv) unless such information is required by Law to be disclosed (provided,
that prior to any disclosure pursuant to this clause (iv), to the extent
reasonably practicable and permitted by Law, the Purchaser shall give the
Sellers and Sellers' Representative notice of such disclosure and reasonably
cooperate with the Sellers and Sellers' Representative to obtain a protective
order or other confidential treatment with respect thereto, and in any event,
only disclose such portion of such information as may be required by such
Law).

(c) For a period of four (4) years following the Closing Date, each Seller and
the Sellers' Representative shall treat all data and information relating to
the Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates or their
respective businesses (including the Acquired Business), assets, liabilities,
and all data and information relating to the customers, suppliers, financial
statements, conditions or operations of the Purchaser, the Company and their
respective Affiliates, as confidential, preserve the confidentiality thereof,
not duplicate or use or disclose to any Person such data or information and
cause its Affiliates and Representatives who have had access to such data and
information to keep confidential and not to use any such data or information
(i) unless such data or information is now or is hereafter disclosed, through
no act or omission of any Seller, or its Affiliates or Representatives, in a
manner making it available to the general public, (ii) is or becomes available
to the Sellers, the Sellers' Representative or their respective Affiliates on
a non-confidential basis from a source who is not, to the Knowledge of the
Sellers, subject to a confidentiality or similar agreement, duty or obligation
prohibiting such disclosure, (iii) was independently developed without the use
of such confidential information by the Sellers, the Sellers' Representative
or their respective Affiliates after the Closing (and for the avoidance of
doubt, was so independently developed without the benefit of any knowledge or
confidential information (or access thereto) that any such Person has by
virtue of Sellers' pre-Closing ownership and operation of the Acquired
Business) or (iv) unless such data or information is required by Law to be
disclosed (provided, that prior to any disclosure pursuant to this clause
(iv), to the extent reasonably practicable and permitted by Law, such Seller
or such Affiliate or Representative shall give the Purchaser notice of such
disclosure and reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser to obtain a protective
order or other confidential treatment with respect thereto, and in any event,
only disclose such portion of such data or information as may be required by
such Law). The Purchaser acknowledges that, following the Closing, the Sellers
and certain of their respective Affiliates will engage in (i) the Acquired
Business, solely as it relates to conducting operations in the ordinary course
to perform its obligations under (A) the Excluded Contracts (other than the
Contracts described in clause (ii) in the definition thereof) in substantially
the same manner as prior to the Closing and (B) the Transition Services
Agreement, and with respect to any other assets of the Business that are
retained by NewCo, (ii) the ownership, operation, development and management
of real property and related assets with respect to any hotel, resort or
residential real property and related assets owned in whole or in part by any
such Seller or any Affiliate of such Seller and (iii) any other business
activities (other than the Acquired Business) any such Seller or any Affiliate
of such Seller currently engages in and any natural extensions thereof
(collectively, "Ancillary Activities"). Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Purchaser agrees that neither the Sellers, the Sellers'
Representative nor any of their respective Affiliates will be in breach of any
provision of this Section 6.03(c) solely to the extent of the Sellers, the
Sellers' Representative or any of their respective Affiliates continuing to
engage in such Ancillary Activities following the Closing Date, provided that
the Sellers, the Sellers' Representative or any of their respective Affiliates
use commercially reasonable efforts to not use the data or information
described in the first sentence of this Section 6.03(c) in connection with
such activities described in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the definition of
Ancillary Activities, and in any event, shall not disclose any such data or
information other than to their Representatives that need to know the same in
connection with the Ancillary Activities applicable to such Representative.
Further, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Affiliates of Sellers own
interests in various properties that are subject to Hotel Management
Agreements and that nothing hereunder limits or restricts any such Affiliate's
ownership, access or use of any data or information related to any such
properties.

(d) For a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, each Seller
agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit (or permit to be directly or indirectly solicited) or
employ any Person who is set forth on Schedule 6.03(d) of the Sellers'
Disclosure Letter; provided that if any individual set forth on Schedule
6.03(d) is, immediately following the Closing, employed by NewCo, and such
individual does not receive an offer of employment from Purchaser or its
Affiliates within thirty (30) days following the termination of the Transition
Services Agreement, then such individual shall be deemed to be removed from
Schedule 6.03(d); provided further that the foregoing shall not prohibit (i) a
general solicitation to the public by means of general advertising or similar
methods of solicitation by search firms not specifically directed at such
Person, (ii) the soliciting, recruiting or hiring of any such Person who has
voluntarily ceased to be employed or retained by the Purchaser, the Company or
any of their respective Affiliates for a period of at least sixty (60) days
without any solicitation by any Seller; or (iii) the soliciting, recruiting or
hiring of any such Person who has involuntarily ceased to be employed or
retained by the Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates.

Section 6.04 Best Efforts; Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Third Party
Consents and Amendments.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto shall use its best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
Transactions as promptly as practicable, including (i) the obtaining of all
necessary actions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental
Authorities, (ii) the making of all necessary registrations and filings and
the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver
from, or to avoid an Action by, any Governmental Authority, and (iii)
defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining
order entered by any court or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed
until the issuance of a final, non-appealable order.

(b) The Sellers, the Company and the Purchaser shall promptly, but in no event
later than five (5) Business Days after the date hereof, make all required
filings under (i) the HSR Act and (ii) any other applicable Laws, and
thereafter make any other required submissions under the HSR Act and other
such Laws and use reasonable best efforts and diligence to satisfy any other
conditions necessary to comply with the HSR Act and any other applicable Laws
and to obtain early termination of any waiting period pursuant thereto.

(c) The Sellers, the Company and the Purchaser shall keep each other apprised
of the status of matters relating to the completion of the Transactions and
promptly furnish the other with copies of notices or other communications
between the Company, the Sellers or the Purchaser or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, Representatives or counsel, as the case may be, and any third
party or any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions. Each of
the Company and the Purchaser shall use its best efforts to take such action
as may be required to cause the expiration of the waiting periods under
applicable Law with respect to the Transactions as promptly as possible after
the execution of this Agreement. The Sellers, the Company and the Purchaser
shall keep each other timely apprised of any inquiries or requests for
additional information from any Governmental Authority pursuant to any
applicable Law and shall comply promptly with any such reasonable inquiry or
request. The Company and the Purchaser shall permit counsel for the other
party reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith
the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed written
communication to any Governmental Authority. Each of the Company and the
Purchaser agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion,
either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions unless it consults with the other party in
advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Authority,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Article 6, each of the parties hereto shall use their
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted
by a Governmental Authority with respect to the application of the HSR Act to
the Transactions. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Purchaser agrees (on
behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates and Subsidiaries) to take or cause
to be taken any and all actions necessary, proper or advisable to avoid,
eliminate and resolve any and all impediments under the HSR Act or trade
regulation law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority (including
the FTC or the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice) or any
other Person with respect to the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement
so as to enable the consummation of the Transactions to occur as soon as
reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the End Date) and to
obtain all consents, approvals and waivers under the HSR Act that may be
required by any Governmental Authority, including any such actions necessary,
proper or advisable to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated,
any decree, decision, order or judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay
the consummation of the Transactions, on or before the End Date.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Article 6, the Purchaser agrees (on behalf of itself and
each of its Affiliates and Subsidiaries) to propose, negotiate, commit to
and/or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, so as to
enable the consummation of the Transactions to occur as soon as reasonably
possible (and in any event no later than the End Date), to (i) sell or
otherwise dispose of, divest, transfer, license, or hold separate and agree to
sell or otherwise dispose of, specific assets or categories of assets or
properties or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, any of the
Purchaser's other assets or businesses (or the assets or businesses of any
Affiliate of the Purchaser) now owned or presently or hereafter sought to be
acquired by the Purchaser or such Affiliate; (ii) terminate, modify and/or
assign any existing agreements, relationships and contractual rights and
obligations; (iii) amend or terminate such existing licenses or other
Intellectual Property agreements and to enter into such new licenses or other
Intellectual Property agreements (and, in each case, to enter into agreements
with the relevant Governmental Authority giving effect thereto); (iv) change
or modify any course of conduct regarding future operations of the Purchaser
(or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries) or the Company and its
Subsidiaries, or (v) otherwise take or commit to take any other action that
would limit the freedom of action of the Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates
or Subsidiaries) with respect to, or their ability to retain, one or more of
their respective operations, divisions, businesses, product lines, customers,
assets or rights or interests, or their freedom of action with respect to the
assets, properties or businesses to be acquired pursuant to this Agreement.
The Purchaser, at its sole cost and expense, will timely comply with all
restrictions and conditions, if any, specified, requested or imposed by the
FTC or the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice as a
requirement for granting any necessary clearance or approval or terminating
any applicable waiting period. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, none of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries shall
be required to agree to or proffer to sell, divest, hold separate, lease,
license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or impair or take any
other action with respect to Purchaser's or any of its Affiliates' or
Subsidiaries' ability to own or operate any assets, properties, businesses or
product lines of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any equity or other interests of the
Company or its Subsidiaries) or any assets, properties, businesses or product
lines of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or otherwise take any action
referenced in the forgoing clauses (i) through (v), in each case that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have (i) a
Material Adverse Effect, (ii) a material adverse effect on the Purchaser and
its Affiliates and Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (iii) the Company, the
Purchaser and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company
shall not, unless requested to do so by the Purchaser, commit to or effect any
action contemplated in this Section 6.04(e).

(f) During the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Closing, except as
required by this Agreement, the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Company, enter into any transaction
that would be reasonably expected to materially impair or delay the
Purchaser's ability to consummate the Transactions or perform its obligations
hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of the
Purchaser, its Subsidiaries, or their respective Affiliates shall, and shall
not cause any Person to, acquire (whether via merger, consolidation, stock or
asset purchase or otherwise), or agree to so acquire, any material amounts of
assets of or any material portion of the equity in any other Person or any
business or division thereof, unless that acquisition or agreement would not
reasonably be expected to (i) materially increase the risk of not obtaining
any authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any
Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the Transactions or the
expiration or termination of any waiting period under any applicable Law; or
(ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an
order prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions, or materially increase
the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise.

Section 6.05 Insurance Policies. Prior to Closing, Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts (at the Purchaser's sole cost) to (a) notify
its insurance providers with respect to insurance policies under which the
Company is currently an insured by virtue of being a Subsidiary of the
Sellers, that there has been a change in control with respect to the Company,
and (b) endorse such insurance policies with the Company as an insured in
respect of (i) occurrences occurring prior to the Closing Date for insurance
written on an "occurrence" basis, and (ii) claims made on or after the Closing
Date arising solely out of occurrences occurring prior to the Closing Date for
insurance written on a claims made basis (also commonly known as "tail
coverage").

Section 6.06 Sellers' Disclosure Letter. From time to time prior to the
Closing, the Sellers and the Company shall have the continuing right to
supplement the Sellers' Disclosure Letter (a "Disclosure Letter Update") in
all respects solely for informational purposes. A Disclosure Letter Update
shall not under any circumstances be deemed to have cured any breach of a
representation and warranty or covenant that might have existed hereunder by
reason of such event or otherwise amend the Sellers' Disclosure Letter in any
respect.

Section 6.07 Employee Matters.

(a) For at least one (1) year following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall,
or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide each employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, including employees not actively at work due to injury,
vacation, military duty, disability or other leave of absence, who continues
to be employed by the Purchaser or its Affiliates as of the Closing (each, a
"Company Employee") with: (i) at least the same level of base salary or hourly
wage rate, as the case may be, that was provided to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) target annual cash performance bonus
opportunity (but not equity-based incentive opportunities) that is no less
than the target annual cash performance bonus opportunity in effect with
respect to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing, (iii)
without duplication of any other severance pay or benefit, severance pay and
benefits for any Company Employee set forth on Schedule 6.07(a) of the
Sellers' Disclosure Letter who incurs an involuntary termination by the
Company (or its employing Affiliate) without cause (as determined by Purchaser
in its good faith discretion) at any time during the one (1)-year period
following the Closing, and who signs a general release of claims in favor of
the Company and its Affiliates in a form prescribed by the Company, severance
pay in the amount and for the duration following termination (payable in
substantially equal installments over such post-termination period), each as
set forth on Schedule 6.07(a) of the Sellers' Disclosure Letter with respect
to such Company Employee (for clarity, the covenant contained in this clause
(iii) shall not apply to any Company Employee who becomes entitled to
severance during the relevant period pursuant to any agreement between such
Company Employee and the Company or any of its Affiliates as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing, rather, the terms of such agreement shall
control) and (iv) health, welfare and retirement benefits (excluding any
defined benefit pension benefits) that are no less favorable in the aggregate
to those provided to either (A) similarly situated employees of the Purchaser
or (B) such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the compensation and benefits of any Company Employee who is
covered by a collective bargaining agreement shall be provided in accordance
with the terms thereof.

(b) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on December
31, 2018, Sellers and their Affiliates shall take all actions necessary to (i)
maintain in effect each of Sellers' and its Affiliates' (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries) health (including medical, dental, vision,
prescription, etc.), welfare, retirement (including 401(k)) and fringe benefit
plans in which Company Employees are eligible to participate as of the date of
this Agreement on substantially the same terms as in effect, in each case, as
of the date of this Agreement, and (ii) cause each Company Employee to remain
eligible to participate in each such benefit plan on terms and conditions
substantially similar to those in effect on the date hereof, subject to the
terms of the applicable plan and applicable Law; provided, that to the extent
that the incremental cost to the Sellers and their Affiliates of providing
benefits under any applicable plan (exclusive of the costs to be reimbursed by
the Purchaser pursuant to the next sentence) materially increases as a result
of providing such benefits to the Company Employees, the Purchaser shall
reimburse the Sellers for such increased costs. In respect of such period,
Seller shall invoice the Purchaser monthly stating in reasonable detail the
actual cost to Seller and its Affiliates of providing such benefits
(including, without limitation, any administrative costs due to Company
Employee participation), and the Purchaser shall reimburse Seller within
thirty days after receiving each such invoice for Seller's actual costs so
invoiced. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 6.07(b)
shall fully satisfy the Purchaser's obligations under Section 6.07(a)(iv)
hereof for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on December 31,
2018.

(c) The Purchaser shall honor the annual bonus and other cash incentive plans
or arrangements of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are in place for
Company Employees (except for any LTIP Awards under the LTIP) for the calendar
year in which the Closing occurs; provided, that such bonus and cash incentive
amounts shall be calculated and paid to the eligible Company Employees
thereunder in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
taking into account the impact of the Transaction on any applicable
performance metrics and after consultation with the Purchaser, in each case,
as determined by Purchaser in its good-faith discretion.

(d) Following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, honor all vacation, sick pay and other paid time off for
Company Employees accrued but unused as of the Closing Date, in each case, to
the extent set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet (collectively, "Accrued
PTO"); provided, however, that following the Closing Date, Company Employees
shall be entitled to use such Accrued PTO only in accordance with applicable
Company policies as in effect following the Closing.

(e) Years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective predecessors shall be taken into account for purposes of
determining eligibility, vesting, and benefit accrual for each Company
Employee under all employee benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements
of the Purchaser or its Affiliates in which such Company Employee is eligible
to participate on or following the Closing Date (each, a "Purchaser Benefit
Plan"), in each case, to the same extent Company Employee was (or would have
been) entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such service under a
comparable Employee Plan prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that no
such crediting of service shall result in duplication of benefits for the same
period of service.

(f) With respect to each Purchaser Benefit Plan that is a group health plan
which replaces coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which any
Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to use commercially reasonable
efforts to: (i) waive all preexisting condition exclusions, evidence of
insurability or good health, waiting periods, actively-at-work exclusions or
other limitations with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to each Company Employee to the extent waived or satisfied under
the comparable Employee Plan in which such Company Employee participated
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) credit each Company Employee
for any co-payments, deductibles and other eligible expenses incurred by such
Company Employee (and his or her covered spouses, dependents or beneficiaries)
under the terms of the Employee Plan for purposes of satisfying any applicable
deductible, co-payment, coinsurance, maximum out-of-pocket requirements and
like adjustments or limitations under the applicable Purchaser Benefit Plan
that replaces such Employee Plan for the plan year in which the Closing Date
occurs (to the extent such credit would have been given under comparable
Employee Plans prior to the Closing Date).

(g) The Company shall use good faith efforts to obtain the execution and
delivery of an LTIP Acknowledgment from each LTIP Recipient to the Company at
or prior to Closing. On the Closing Date, the Company shall pay, through the
Company's payroll processing, to such LTIP Recipient his or her LTIP Award
(less any applicable withholding obligations), the amount of which is set
forth on Schedule 6.07(g) of the Sellers' Disclosure Letter opposite such LTIP
Recipient's name (net of applicable tax withholding) (or if such amounts are
not known on the date hereof, such amounts shall be included in an updated
version of such Schedule 6.07(g) that is provided to Purchaser prior to
Closing, which amounts shall be based on the Closing Purchase Price and the
methodology for determining such amounts set forth in the applicable LTIP
awards). The Company shall take all actions, including adopting such
resolutions, providing such notices, and using good faith efforts to obtain
any consents, in each case, as may be necessary or desirable, to ensure that,
following the Closing (subject to the Company's satisfaction of the foregoing
payment obligation), the LTIP and all awards thereunder shall be terminated
and extinguished and no Person shall have any right, claim or interest in
respect of any of the foregoing.

(h) Unless otherwise directed by the Purchaser in writing prior to the
Closing, the Company shall take or cause to be taken all actions necessary to
terminate any and all Employee Plans that are sponsored by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries which are intended to qualify as qualified cash or
deferred arrangements under Section 401(a) of the Code (the "401(k) Plans"),
effective no later than the day immediately prior to the Closing. Not less
than three (3) days prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide the
Purchaser with executed resolutions (in a form previously reviewed and
approved by the Purchaser) effecting the termination of any such Employee
Plan(s) no later than the day immediately prior to the Closing and amending
any such Employee Plan to the extent necessary to comply with all applicable
Laws.

(i) Nothing contained in this Section 6.07 or any other provision of this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall (i) give any third Person, other than
the parties to this Agreement, any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever, including but not limited to any right to continued employment or
service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates, under or by reason of this Section 6.07 or create any third-
party beneficiary rights in any other person, including any current or former
Service Provider, to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.07; (ii) prevent
or restrict in any way the right of the Purchaser to terminate reassign,
promote or demote any Service Provider (or to cause any of the foregoing
actions) at any time following the Closing Date, or to change (or cause the
change of) the title, powers, duties, responsibilities, functions, locations,
salaries, other compensation or terms or conditions of employment or service
of any such Service Providers at any time following the Closing Date; (iii)
obligate the Purchaser to adopt or maintain any particular plan or program or
other compensatory or benefits arrangement at any time or prevent the
Purchaser from modifying or terminating any such plan, program or other
compensatory or benefits arrangement at any time or any other matter related
thereto; or (iv) be construed to amend or modify any Employee Plan or any
employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement sponsored by the
Purchaser or its Affiliates.

(j) At or prior to the Closing (but no earlier than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing), Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser updated lists
including the information set forth in the first sentence of Section 4.22(f)
and the first sentence of Section 4.22(g), provided all references to "the
date of this Agreement" shall be replaced with "the date of delivery of such
updated information" and any use of "current" or "currently" or "present"
shall be interpreted as of the date of such delivery.

(k) Without limiting any other provision hereof, during the period commencing
on the date hereof and ending October 31, 2018, Sellers and their Affiliates
acknowledge and agree that they shall refrain, and shall cause NewCo to
refrain, whether directly or indirectly, formally or informally, from
soliciting, negotiating, offering employment to or hiring any of the any
Retention Agreement Employee (such actions, collectively, the "Retention
Employee Nonsolicit"). If, during such two (2)-week period, the Purchaser
notifies Sellers that it intends to seek to enter into employment agreement(s)
with one or more Retention Agreement Employees on terms sufficient to
constitute a "Continuing Employment Offer" (within the meaning of the
applicable Retention Agreement), then Sellers and their Affiliates acknowledge
and agree that they shall, and shall cause NewCo to, continue to abide by the
Retention Employee Nonsolicit with respect to any such Retention Employees
through the Closing and for a period of no less than ninety (90) days
thereafter.

(l) Effective as of immediately prior to the Closing, each of the Sellers, the
Company and the Company's Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall take all
necessary actions to transfer to NewCo: (x) (A) all Service Providers that are
not employed at a "home office location" of the Company and who primarily
provide services to any property the management of which will be transferred
to NewCo pursuant to the Restructuring Transactions (the "Property-Level
Retained Employees") and (B) all Retention Agreement Retained Employees (the
Property-Level Retained Employees and the Retention Agreement Retained
Employees, together, the "Retained Employees"); (y) all employment agreements,
service agreements retention, transaction and/or severance agreements or other
bilateral agreements with any Retained Employees that govern terms of service
and/or provide for the payment or provision of any compensation or benefits to
or for the benefit of such Retained Employees (including without limitation
the Retention Agreements); and (z) all accrued paid-time-off and any other
obligations owed by the Company or any Subsidiaries of the Company to or in
respect of any Retained Employee (including, without limitation, any accrued
bonuses (whether performance-based or otherwise)). For clarity, in no event
shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries transfer to NewCo any Employee
Plan that provides compensation or benefits to or for the benefit of any
Service Providers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who are not
Retained Employees. Upon the Closing, Sellers shall cause each Retention
Agreement Retained Employee to be notified in writing (with such notification
subject to the Purchaser's advance review and comment) that such Retention
Agreement Employee's Retention Agreement and all rights and obligations
thereunder has been transferred and assigned to NewCo effective as of
immediately prior to the Closing and that any and all obligations to the
Retention Agreement Employee thereunder (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any "Transaction Bonus," "Retention Bonus," "Severance Payment,"
"Contingent Bonus" or similar payment thereunder (each as may be defined in
the Retention Agreement Employee's Retention Agreement)) shall be solely
obligations of NewCo as of the Closing.

Section 6.08 Further Action. Each of the parties hereto shall use all
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, to
do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law, and to execute and deliver such documents and other papers,
each as may be required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and to
consummate and make effective the Transactions.

Section 6.09 DandO Indemnification.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall not, and shall cause
the Company and its Subsidiaries not to, take any steps that would reasonably
be expected to materially and adversely affect the rights of any individual
who served as a director, manager or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Closing Date (each, a "DandO Indemnified
Person") to be indemnified, either under applicable Law or the organizational
documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, as they existed
immediately prior to the Closing Date, against any costs or expenses
(including attorneys' fees and expenses of investigation, defense and ongoing
monitoring), judgments, penalties, fines, losses, charges, demands, actions,
suits, proceedings, settlements, assessments, deficiencies, Taxes, interest,
obligations, damages, liabilities or amounts paid in settlement incurred in
connection with any claim, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Closing Date and relating to the fact that the DandO
Indemnified Person was a director, manager or officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Closing Date.

(b) The Company shall, and Purchaser shall cause the Company to (i) maintain
in effect for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date the current
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by or on
behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing
Date (provided that the Company may substitute therefor policies, of at least
the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not
less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries when compared to the insurance maintained by the Company as of
the date hereof); provided, however, that in no event shall such policies
provide for a premium amount of any one year in excess of 300% of the annual
premium paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year for its
directors and officers, or (ii) obtain as of the Closing Date a "tail"
insurance policy with a claims period of six (6) years from the Closing Date
with at least the same coverage and amounts, and containing terms and
conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case with respect to claims arising out
of or relating to events which occurred on or prior to the Closing Date
(including in connection with the Transactions).

Section 6.10 RandW Policy. The Purchaser and the Sellers shall cooperate and use
commercially reasonable efforts to enable Purchaser to obtain, at or prior to
the Closing, a buyer-side representation and warranty insurance policy (with
the primary policy being provided by Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance
Company (or an Affiliate thereof) and the excess coverage policy being
provided by Everest Indemnity Insurance Company (or an Affiliate thereof)) in
the form set forth on Exhibit C (collectively, the "RandW Policy"). All premiums
and related costs due under the RandW Policy shall be paid by the Purchaser to
the applicable insurer at or prior to the Closing.

Section 6.11 Restructuring Transactions. The Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, complete the Restructuring Transactions in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in Schedule 2 hereto, including
executing and delivering all related agreements, instruments, certificates and
all other documents required to effect the actions contemplated thereby. Prior
to the Closing, the Company will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to,
take any action with respect to the Restructuring Transactions in any manner
adverse to the Purchaser without the Purchaser's prior written consent. Upon
consummation of the Restructuring Transactions, the Sellers shall cause NewCo
to sign a joinder to this Agreement in the form of Exhibit F attached hereto.

Section 6.12 Termination of Affiliate Transactions. Except as set forth in
Schedule 6.12 of the Sellers' Disclosure Letter, the Sellers and the Company
shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to, take all necessary actions to
ensure that all Affiliate Transactions are terminated at or prior to the
Closing, with no further liability or other Losses to the Purchaser or its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) with respect thereto.

Section 6.13 Non-Solicitation. From the date hereof through the earlier of the
Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section
9.01 (the "Exclusivity Period"), each of the Sellers and the Company agree
that, except with respect to the Restructuring Transactions or as otherwise
expressly set forth herein, it will not, it will cause its Affiliates not to
and it will direct its officers, managers, members, Representatives and
advisors not to, directly or indirectly, without the Purchaser's prior written
consent, take actions to encourage, solicit, enter into, initiate or hold
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to or respond to
the submission of any proposal, offer or inquiry from, any Person (other than
the Purchaser and the Purchaser's Representatives) regarding, or enter into
any contract, arrangement or understanding (including any letter of intent or
memorandum of understanding for) any disposition or purchase of any equity
interest in, any equity investment in or any sale of all or any significant
part of the assets or Business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
any merger, reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, exchange of
equity or other business combination or disposition involving the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (any offers or inquiries pertaining to any of the
foregoing matters are referred to as an "Acquisition Transaction Proposal").
If, during the Exclusivity Period, any Person (other than the Purchaser)
approaches the Sellers, the Company or any of their respective Representatives
about an Acquisition Transaction Proposal, the Sellers shall promptly inform
such Person of the existence of this provision and shall within two (2)
Business Days advise the Purchaser following the receipt of any Acquisition
Transaction Proposal.

Section 6.14 Certain Third Party Consents; Certain Post-Closing Actions.

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Sellers and the Company on the one hand, and
Purchaser on the other hand, shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with, and
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (i) from any
applicable third party (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the parties to
the Contracts set forth in Section 4.06 of the Sellers' Disclosure Schedule
but excluding the parties to any Designated Contract) any required consent,
approval or authorization with respect to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the other agreements, documents and certificates contemplated
hereby or the consummation of the Transactions, in each case, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser and (ii) all Designated
Contract Amendments. In connection therewith, the parties shall take such
reasonable actions as each other may request from time to time and shall
coordinate with each other in respect thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
but subject to the covenants and agreements set forth in Section 6.14(c) with
respect to Rebranding Costs, in no event shall the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be obligated to bear any
expense or pay any fee (other than the payment of nominal administrative,
processing or similar fees or charges) or grant any concession in connection
with obtaining any such consent, approval or authorization or Designed
Contract Amendment.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but in furtherance
thereof, prior to the Closing the parties shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) obtain a Specified Contract Consent in
respect of each Specified Contract and a Designated Contract Amendment in
respect of each Designated Contract, (ii) cause each Particular Contract to be
terminated and (iii) following such termination, cause the owner of any
Particular Hotel to deliver a Replacement Deliverable; provided, however,
that, prior to the Closing, neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates
shall contact, directly or indirectly, any counterparty to any Specified
Contract, Designated Contract, Particular Contract or any other Contract to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party without the prior
written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) and, in any event, any such approved communication between the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates with any counterparty to any Specified
Contract, Designated Contract, Particular Contract or any other Contract to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party shall require the
reasonable participation of a Representative of the Company unless the parties
agree otherwise; provided, further, that, during the ninety (90) day period
immediately following the Closing, neither Sellers nor any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives shall contact, directly or indirectly, any
counterparty to any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party unless such contact is made by one of the individuals set forth on
Schedule 6.14(b), such individual first provides reasonable advance notice of
such contact to Purchaser and such individual provides the opportunity for a
Representative of Purchaser or the Company to participate in such
communication. In connection with the foregoing, each party shall promptly
provide each counterparty to any Specified Contract, Designated Contract or
Particular Contract, as applicable, with such additional information as such
counterparty may reasonably request, and the Purchaser and the Company shall
each promptly notify the other of any material communication received by it or
its Representatives from any such counterparty relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and/or the actions described in the foregoing
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) and shall provide in such notification a summary
of such communication. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, any Specified
Contract Consent, Designated Contract Amendment, termination of a Particular
Contract or entry into a replacement Contract for a Particular Contract, in
each case, obtained pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
shall be effective only upon the occurrence of the Closing. All communications
pursuant to this Section 6.14(b) between the parties hereto and their
respective Affiliates or Representatives, on the one hand, and any
counterparty to any Specified Contract, Designated Contract, Particular
Contract or any other Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party shall be conducted in good faith and generally in furtherance of
the business interests of each of the Sellers, the Company and the Purchaser.

(c) In connection with the parties' use of commercially reasonable efforts to
complete the actions in respect of Particular Contracts and Particular Hotels
described in clauses (ii) and (iii) of Section 6.14(b) (the "Rebranding
Actions"), to the extent required to complete the Rebranding Actions, Sellers
shall incur and pay Rebranding Costs with respect to each Particular Hotel in
an amount up to the amount set forth across from such Particular Hotel's name
on Schedule 6.14(c). In the event Sellers, the Company or their respective
Affiliates incur and pay any such Rebranding Costs, and as a result thereof,
complete the Rebranding Actions with respect to any Particular Hotel,
Purchaser shall reimburse to Sellers an amount equal to Sellers' documented
Rebranding Costs in respect of such Particular Hotel (in each case, up to the
amount set forth across from such Particular Hotel's name on Schedule
6.14(c)). Purchaser shall be responsible for and indemnify and hold Seller and
its Affiliates harmless from and against all costs, liabilities and expenses
related to the transition of a Particular Hotel from the applicable legacy
franchisor brand and network to the brand and network of Purchaser and its
Affiliates; provided, that Sellers shall reimburse Purchaser an amount equal
to fifty percent (50%) of all reasonable and documented out of pocket costs
and expenses incurred by Purchaser or its Affiliates related to the transition
of a Particular Hotel's website, signage and collateral.

(d) In the event that, as of the Closing, (i) any Specified Contract Consent
has not been obtained, (ii) any Designated Contract Amendment has not been
entered into by all parties thereto or (iii) with respect to any Particular
Hotel, (A) the applicable Particular Contract has not been terminated or (B) a
Replacement Deliverable has not been executed and delivered by the owner of
such Particular Hotel, then the Closing Purchase Price will be reduced by
virtue of the Aggregate Closing Reduction. In any such event, provided that
the Purchase Price is an amount equal to less than $600,000,000, for a period
equal to one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing (which period may
be reasonably extended with respect to one or more Particular Hotels,
Designated Hotels or Specified Hotels by mutual agreement of the Purchaser and
Sellers' Representative to the extent the Purchaser determines in good faith
that, as applicable, the granting of a Specified Contract Consent, entry into
a Designated Contract Amendment or the termination of a Particular Contract
and delivery of a Replacement Deliverable is reasonably likely to occur in the
following ten (10) days), the parties will work together and continue to take
the actions described in the foregoing Sections 6.14(a) and 6.14(b), and if,
prior to the termination of such period, (1) any Specified Contract Consent
that was not obtained at Closing is obtained, (2) any Designated Contract
Amendment that was not entered into by all parties thereto prior to Closing is
entered into by all such parties or (3) any Particular Contract that was not
terminated at Closing is terminated and a Replacement Deliverable is delivered
by the owner of the applicable Particular Hotel then, in each case, Purchaser
will pay to NewCo the Per Hotel Reduction applicable to such Specified
Contract, Designated Contract or Particular Hotel, as applicable; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall have no
obligation to pay any amounts owing to NewCo pursuant to this sentence until
the sum of (x) the difference between $157,000,000 and the Aggregate Closing
Reduction (without giving effect, for the avoidance of doubt, to the operation
of the proviso at the end of the definition of "Purchase Price," such amount,
the "Pre-Closing Earned Reduction Amount") and (y) the aggregate amount owing
to NewCo pursuant to this sentence exceeds the Threshold Per Hotel Reduction
Amount, at which point Purchaser shall only be required to pay NewCo amounts
owing pursuant to this Section 6.14(d) in excess of the amount equal to the
difference between the Threshold Per Hotel Reduction Amount and the Pre-
Closing Earned Reduction Amount; provided, however, that in no event shall the
sum of the Purchase Price plus the aggregate amount paid to the Sellers
pursuant to this Section 6.14(d) exceed $600,000,000. In the event that any
Particular Contract is terminated and a Replacement Deliverable is delivered
in accordance with the foregoing clause (3), concurrently with Purchaser's
payment of the applicable Per Hotel Reduction to the Sellers (or if no such
payment is required pursuant to the foregoing proviso or otherwise, then
promptly following the occurrence of such actions), the parties shall cause
the Affiliate of the Sellers that is the party to or beneficiary of the
applicable Replacement Deliverable to be transferred to Purchaser or its
Affiliate, and the provisions of Section 6.08 shall apply thereto mutatis
mutandis.

Section 6.15 Classic Resorts Earn-out Payments. In the event the Purchaser,
the Company or their respective Affiliates incur and pay any Earn-Out Payment
(as defined in the Classic Resorts Asset Purchase Agreement) in accordance
with Section 2.7(f) of the Classic Resorts Asset Purchase Agreement, Sellers
shall, severally and not jointly, reimburse to the Purchaser an amount equal
to any such Earn-Out Payment, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account specified in writing by the Purchaser within three (3) Business
Days of the later of (a) the date such Earn-Out Payment was paid and (b) the
date Sellers received written notice that such Earn-Out Payment was paid.

Section 6.16 Transition Services Agreement Exhibits. The parties agree and
acknowledge that the exhibits and schedules attached to the form of Transition
Services Agreement attached as Exhibit A hereto are in draft form and do not
reflect the parties' final memorialization of such exhibits and schedules, and
in furtherance thereof, from the date of this Agreement until the Closing, the
parties will reasonably cooperate with each other and work in good faith to
update and finalize such exhibits and schedules to the form of Transition
Services Agreement (including by agreeing to appropriate service lengths and
by describing such services in greater detail). Such finalized exhibits and
schedules shall be attached to the Transition Services Agreement that is
executed and delivered at Closing.

Section 6.17 Loyalty Program. Prior to Closing, Purchaser will work in good
faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to transition hotels set forth
on Schedule 6.17 onto the loyalty platform and program operated by Purchaser
and its Affiliates, effective as of Closing. In connection therewith,
Purchaser shall engage with the owners of such hotels to provide them with all
reasonably requested information regarding such loyalty platform and program
and shall otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to manage Purchaser's
systems in a manner to appropriately implement such transition; provided,
however, that, prior to the Closing, neither the Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall contact, directly or indirectly, any counterparty to any
owners of such hotels without the prior written consent of the Company (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and, in any event, any such
approved communication between the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates with any
owners of such hotels shall require the reasonable participation of a
Representative of the Company unless the parties agree otherwise. In
furtherance thereof, Sellers will cause the owners of the hotels set forth on
Section 6.17 of the Disclosure Schedule to agree to Purchaser's standard
loyalty program terms with respect to the operation of such hotels.

(a) The representations and warranties made by the Sellers, the Company and
the Purchaser in this Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of one
(1) year following the Closing; provided, however, that the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 3.01 (Organization and Authority of the

warranty or covenant that would otherwise terminate at the expiration of the
applicable Survival Period with respect thereto, has been given to the party
against whom indemnification may be sought on or prior to the expiration of
the applicable Survival Period, such representation or warranty or covenant
shall survive only with respect to the matters specified in such notice and
such survival shall only apply to the portion of any such representation or
warranty or covenant with respect to which such breach or inaccuracy has
occurred.

(c) After the Closing, absent Fraud, the indemnities set forth in this Article
8 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties hereto with respect
to any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement or
in any agreement, certificate or instrument contemplated hereby; provided,
however, that nothing contained herein shall limit or impair the right of any
party (1) to specific performance or injunctive relief (including under
Section 11.13) in connection with another party's breach of its obligations
under this Agreement, (2) in any dispute under Section 2.07 (which disputes
will be resolved in accordance with the dispute mechanism set forth in Section
2.07(d)) or (3) in the case of Fraud. In furtherance of the foregoing, from
and after the Closing Date, except (w) as otherwise provided in this Article
8, (x) for matters arising out of actions or omissions occurring after the
Closing Date, (y) in the case of Fraud or (z) for breaches of this Agreement,
(i) the parties, on behalf of themselves and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives, hereby waive, and release each other and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives from, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any and all other Losses, rights, defenses, claims and causes
of action (including rights of contributions, if any), known or unknown,
foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that it may
have against the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives (in the case of the release provided by the Purchaser), or the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) or Representatives (in the case of the release provided by the
Sellers and the Sellers' Representative), as the case may be, arising under or
based upon any federal, state or local Law (including any such Law arising
under or based upon any securities Law, Environmental Law, common Law or
otherwise), (ii) the Purchaser, the Sellers, the Sellers' Representative and
the Company and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, on behalf of
themselves and their respective Affiliates and Representatives, hereby waive,
and release any director or officer of the Company from, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, defenses, claims and
causes of action (including rights of contributions, if any), known or
unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that
it may have against such director or officer in his or her capacity as such
based upon any federal, state or local Law (other than any employment-related
claims), and (iii) each of the parties expressly acknowledges that it has had,
or has had and waived, the opportunity to be advised by independent legal
counsel and hereby waives and relinquishes all rights and benefits afforded
by, and does so understanding and acknowledging the significance and
consequence of such specific waiver of, any applicable Law similar in nature
to Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, which provides:

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED THE SETTLEMENT WITH
THE DEBTOR.

Section 8.02 Indemnification of the Purchaser.

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 8.02, Section 8.06 and the other
Sections of this Article 8, following the Closing, the Purchaser and each of
its Affiliates and Representatives (each hereinafter a "Purchaser Indemnified
Party") shall be indemnified by the Sellers, severally and not jointly, from
and against the amount of any and all Losses incurred by them arising out of:

(i) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty, as of the
date hereof or as of the Closing, made by such Seller under Article 3 of this
Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or made by NewCo in the
Joinder;

(ii) any breach or failure to perform by such Seller of any of its covenants
or agreements under this Agreement or any document contemplated hereby;

(iii) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty, as of
the date hereof or as of the Closing, made by the Company under Article 4 of
this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or made by NewCo
in the Joinder;

(iv) any breach or failure to perform by the Company of its covenants or
agreements under this Agreement or any document contemplated hereby;

(v) (w) the NewCo Employee Liabilities, (x) the failure to deliver an LTIP
Acknowledgment, (y) the Specified Matters or (z) any LTIP Remediation Costs
(to the extent not counted in Company Indebtedness) (the indemnity provided in
this clause (v), the "Employee Matters Indemnity"); and

(vi) any Loss related to any Excluded Contract (the indemnity provided in this
clause (vi), the "Specific Indemnity").

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no representation, warranty
or covenant made by the Sellers or the Company in respect of Taxes, including
under Section 4.19 (other than the representations and warranties in Sections
4.19(j), (o) or (q)), shall apply or give rise to any claims for Losses with
respect to Taxes arising in the Post-Closing Tax Period, other than any
imputed underpayments imposed under Section 6225 of the Code in a Post-Closing
Tax Period which relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

Except to the extent of its obligations in respect of the Specific Indemnity,
in no event shall either Seller be responsible for Losses in excess of the
portion of the Final Purchase Price paid to such Seller.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section
8.02(a) unless the Purchaser Indemnified Party has provided the Sellers'
Representative with written notice of such claim in accordance with Section
8.04(a) or 8.05(a), as applicable.

(c) The Purchaser shall use, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing) to use, commercially
reasonable efforts in accordance with applicable Law to mitigate any Loss for
which indemnification may be sought hereunder upon becoming aware of any event
which would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto.

Section 8.03 Indemnification of the Sellers.

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 8.03, Section 8.06 and the other
Sections of this Article 8, following the Closing, the Purchaser agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold the Sellers, and each of their respective
Affiliates and Representatives (each a "Seller Indemnified Party") harmless
from and against any and all Losses incurred by them arising out of:

(i) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty, as of the
date hereof or as of the Closing, made by the Purchaser under this Agreement
or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto; and

(ii) any breach or failure to perform by the Purchaser of any of its covenants
or agreements under this Agreement or any document contemplated hereby.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Seller
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under this
Section 8.03 unless the applicable Seller Indemnified Party has provided the
Purchaser with written notice of such claim in accordance with Section
8.04(a), 8.05(a) or Section 10.03, as applicable.

(c) The Sellers shall use, and shall cause their Affiliates to use,
commercially reasonable efforts in accordance with applicable Law to mitigate
any Loss for which indemnification may be sought hereunder upon becoming aware
of any event which would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise
thereto.

Section 8.04 Procedures for Indemnification Other Than Third-Party Claims.

(a) If any Purchaser Indemnified Party or any Seller Indemnified Party
(hereinafter an "Indemnified Party") shall claim to have suffered a Loss
(other than with respect to any claim asserted, demand or other Action by any
Person who is not a party to this Agreement (hereinafter a "Third-Party
Claim")) for which indemnification is available under Section 8.02 or 8.03, as
the case may be (for purposes of this Section 8.04, regardless of whether such
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive a payment in respect of such claim by
virtue of the provisions of Section 8.05), the Indemnified Party shall notify
the party required to provide indemnification (hereinafter an "Indemnifying
Party") in writing (a "Claim Notice") of such claim promptly (but in no event
more than thirty (30) days following the discovery of such claim and in no
event after the expiration of the applicable Survival Period) (provided, that
the failure by the Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability to the Indemnified Party
except to the extent that such failure shall have actually and materially
prejudiced the defense of such claim and then only to the extent of such
prejudice), which written notice shall describe the facts and circumstances
giving rise to such Loss, the basis upon which indemnity is being sought, the
amount or estimated amount of the Loss, if known or reasonably ascertainable
at the time such claim is made (or if not then reasonably ascertainable, the
maximum amount of such claim reasonably estimated by the Indemnified Party),
and the method of computation of such Loss, all with reasonable particularity
and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of
which such Loss shall have occurred.

(b) If the Indemnified Party shall have received from the Indemnifying Party,
within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Indemnifying Party's receipt of a
Claim Notice made in accordance with Section 8.04(a), a written notice setting
forth the Indemnifying Party's objections to such claim and the Indemnifying
Party's reasons for such objection, then the parties shall negotiate in good
faith for a period of at least twenty (20) Business Days from the date the
Indemnified Party receives such objection (such period is hereinafter referred
to as the "Negotiation Period"). After the Negotiation Period, if the parties
still cannot agree on the claim, the Indemnified Party may, at any time
thereafter, until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with
respect to its claim for indemnification, commence legal proceedings against
the Indemnifying Party to enforce its rights to indemnification from and
against any Losses described in the written notice described in Section
8.04(a) above.

(c) In the event of a Third-Party Claim under this Agreement, at the
reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party, the Sellers or the Purchaser, as
applicable, and its and their Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives
shall grant the Indemnifying Party and its Representatives reasonable access
to the books, records and properties of the Sellers or the Purchaser, as
applicable, and their Subsidiaries and their Representatives to the extent
reasonably related to the matters to which the Third-Party Claim relates. All
such access shall be granted during normal business hours and shall be granted
under conditions designed to minimize the disruption to the businesses of the
Sellers or the Purchaser, as applicable, and their Subsidiaries and Affiliates
and their Representatives, as the case may be; provided, that such access
would not reasonably be expected to jeopardize or violate any attorney-client
or other applicable legal privilege, applicable Law or Contract or other
confidentiality obligations (provided that, the Sellers or the Purchaser, as
applicable, and their Subsidiaries and Affiliates and their Representatives,
as the case may be, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such
access as can be provided (or otherwise find alternative means to convey such
information regarding the applicable matter as can be conveyed) without
violating such privilege, Law or Contract or other confidentiality
obligation). The Indemnifying Party shall not, and shall cause its
Representatives not to, use (except in connection with such Third-Party Claim)
or disclose to any third person other than the Representatives of the
Indemnifying Party (except as may be required by applicable Law) any
confidential information obtained pursuant to this Section 8.04(c).

Section 8.05 Procedures for Third-Party Claims.

(a) Any Indemnified Party seeking indemnification pursuant to this Article 8
in respect of any Third-Party Claim shall give the Indemnifying Party from
whom indemnification with respect to such claim is sought: (i) prompt written
notice (but in no event more than ten (10) Business Days after the Indemnified
Party acquires knowledge thereof and in no event after the expiration of the
applicable Survival Period) of such Third-Party Claim; and (ii) copies of all
material documents and information (including court papers) relating to any
such Third-Party Claim within ten (10) Business Days of their being obtained
by the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the failure by the
Indemnified Party to so notify or provide copies within either such ten (10)
Business Day period to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any liability to the Indemnified Party for any
liability hereunder except to the extent that such failure shall have actually
and materially prejudiced the defense of such Third-Party Claim and then only
to the extent of such prejudice.

(b) In the event of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, to investigate, contest,
defend or settle any Third-Party Claim that may result in Losses with respect
to which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Article 8 and select legal counsel of its choosing in connection therewith
(provided that such notice shall include an irrevocable acknowledgment of the
Indemnifying Party that the Third-Party Claim may result in Losses, and that
if such Losses do so result, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article 8);
provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may, at its option and at its
own expense, participate in the investigation, contesting, defense or
settlement of any such Third-Party Claim through Representatives of its own
choosing; provided, further, that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle or
compromise any Third-Party Claim unless the terms of such settlement or
compromise (i) call only for a payment to the Indemnified Party (or of the
Third-Party Claim directly), the full amount of which is indemnified
hereunder, (ii) does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon
the Indemnified Party, (iii) does not require an admission or acknowledgment
of fault, wrongdoing or violation of Law by the Indemnified Party, (iv)
contains an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party in respect of such
claim and (v) would not be reasonably expected, in the good faith judgment of
the Indemnified Party, to establish a precedent, custom or practice materially
adverse to the continuing business interests or prospects of the Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates. If requested in writing by the Indemnifying Party,
the Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party
and its counsel in contesting any Third-Party Claim or, if appropriate and
related to the Third-Party Claim in question, in making any reasonable
counterclaim against the Person making such Third-Party Claim, or any cross-
complaint against any Person (other than the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates) or similar action. If the Indemnifying Party shall not have
elected to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim within ten (10)
Business Days of receipt of the Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right, at its option and at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, to do
so in such manner as it deems appropriate; provided, however, the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim at
any time thereafter if it acknowledges in writing that such Third-Party Claim
may result in Losses, and that if such Losses do so result, then the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification by the Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Article 8. In the event any Indemnified Party settles
or compromises or consents to the entry of any judgment with respect to any
Third-Party Claim the defense of which, the Indemnifying Party has properly
assumed hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
such Indemnified Party shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived all rights
to make a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement with respect to
such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
participate in (but not to control) the defense of any Third-Party Claim which
it has not elected to defend with its own counsel and at its expense.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the
Indemnifying Party be entitled to conduct or control the defense, compromise
and settlement of any Third-Party Claim if (i) such claim seeks as the sole
remedy an injunction, other equitable relief or any other non-monetary relief
against the Indemnified Party, (ii) in the event such claim were to be decided
adversely to the Indemnified Party, the aggregate amount of Losses associated
therewith, together with all other outstanding claims would reasonably be
expected to exceed the aggregate liability limitations set forth in this
Article 8, (iii) such claim relates to or arises out of any allegedly criminal
activity or quasicriminal activity, (iv) the Indemnifying Party is also a
party or has an interest in such Third-Party Claim, which interest conflicts
with the interests of the Indemnified Party (as determined by outside counsel
applying the conflict-of-interest rules restricting attorney conduct in the
applicable jurisdiction if counsel for the Indemnifying Party were to act as
counsel for the Indemnified Party) or (v) indemnification in respect of such
Third-Party Claim is being sought pursuant to the Specific Indemnity in
respect of an Excluded Contract of the type described in clause (ii) of the
definition thereof (provided, that in the case of this clause (v), the
Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any such Third-Party Claim
without the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (it being agreed and
understood that the determination as to whether it is reasonable to withhold,
condition or delay such consent, shall take into account various factors,
including costs associated with such settlement or compromise, expediency in
resolving such Third-Party Claim and the totality of the other circumstances
related to any such Third-Party Claim), unless (w) such settlement or
compromise provides for a cash payment to the applicable third party of
greater than $3,000,000, (x) the applicable Excluded Contract has previously
been terminated, or the applicable settlement or compromise includes as a term
thereof, or otherwise results in, the termination of the applicable Excluded
Contract and (y) the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to reimbursement of
its indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 8.11(c) hereof, in which
event such consent may be withheld, conditioned or delayed in the Indemnifying
Party's sole discretion)). In the event of any Third-Party Claim for which
indemnification is being sought pursuant to the Specific Indemnity in respect
of an Excluded Contract of the type described in clause (ii) of the definition
thereof, (A) the Indemnifying Party shall at its own expense have the
opportunity to participate in (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not control)
the defense thereof, (B) the Indemnified Party will consult in good faith with
the Indemnifying Party on a periodic basis with respect to litigation strategy
and accrual of litigation costs and (C) the Indemnified Party will consider in
good faith any comments or requests reasonably proposed by the Indemnifying
Party with respect thereto.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Indemnifying Party
may only investigate, contest, defend or settle such Third-Party Claim if the
insurer under the RandW Policy is not entitled, or if entitled does not elect,
to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim.

Section 8.06 Additional Limits on Rights to Indemnification.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the
case of Fraud, in no event shall the Sellers be liable for indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.02(a)(i) or Section 8.02(a)(iii):

(i) for any individual claim where the Losses relating to such claim (or other
claims arising from substantially the same facts or circumstances) is less
than $25,000 (the "Individual Basket Amount") (and any such items shall not be
aggregated for purposes of this Section 8.06(a)(i)); provided, however, that
if such amount is exceeded, the Purchaser Indemnified Party may seek
indemnification hereunder for any and all such Losses with respect to such
claim (or claims);

(ii) except with respect to any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any Fundamental
Representation or any representation or warranty set forth in Section 4.19
(Taxes), unless and until any Losses as to which the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties otherwise may be entitled to indemnification hereunder exceed
$2,250,000 (the "Deductible Amount"); provided, however, that after the
aggregate amount of all indemnifiable Losses exceeding the Individual Basket
Amount with respect thereto exceeds the Deductible Amount, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall, in the aggregate, be entitled to indemnification
only to the extent the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds the
Deductible Amount;

(iii) for any Losses, in the aggregate, related to any breach of, or
inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by the Sellers under
Article 3 (other than a Fundamental Representation) or the Company under
Article 4 (other than a Fundamental Representation or any representation or
warranty set forth in Section 4.19 (Taxes)) to the extent that the aggregate
amount of such Losses exceeds $60,000,000 (the "Cap"); provided, however, that
all Losses of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be (A) applied first to
satisfy the Deductible Amount as provided in Section 8.06(a)(ii) and (B) then
recovered from the Sellers, up to a maximum amount not to exceed the
difference between the Cap and the Deductible Amount; and

(iv) for any Losses in the aggregate related to breaches of Fundamental
Representations or any representation or warranty set forth in Section 4.19
(Taxes), to the extent the aggregate amount of such Losses (together with all
other Losses) exceeds an amount equal to the Final Purchase Price.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive remedy with respect to Losses for
which they may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.02(a)(i)
or Section 8.02(a)(iii) (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.02,
this Section 8.06 and the other Sections of this Article 8) shall be as
follows: (A) with respect to representations and warranties other than
Fundamental Representations or any representation or warranty set forth in
Section 4.19 (Taxes), to satisfy the amount of such Losses first from payment
by the Sellers of the Seller Self-Retention Amount and second out of the RandW
Policy and (B) with respect to Fundamental Representations or any
representation or warranty set forth in Section 4.19 (Taxes), to satisfy the
amount of such Losses in the following order of priority: (I) first, out of
the RandW Policy (following payment by the Sellers of the Seller Self-Retention
Amount) and (II) second, to the extent that any such Losses are in excess of
the limits of the RandW Policy (or excluded from the scope thereof other than as
a result of any breach by the Purchaser of the terms of the RandW Policy that is
either (x) not disputed by the Purchaser or (y) that is finally resolved in
favor of the insurer under the RandW Policy or any failure by Purchaser to
timely file a claim under the RandW Policy or use commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue recovery thereunder), directly against the Sellers. For
purposes hereof, "Seller Self-Retention Amount" means one-half of the self-
retention amount under the RandW Policy. For purposes of clarity and for the
avoidance of doubt, the Sellers shall only be required to pay the Seller Self-
Retention Amount on one occasion.

For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 8.06(a) shall not
apply to any claims in respect of, or brought pursuant to, the Specific
Indemnity, even if the facts or circumstances giving rise to such claims would
otherwise give rise to a claim for indemnification that would be subject to
the provisions of this Section 8.06(a) (i.e., a claim for indemnification
under Section 8.02(a)(i) or Section 8.02(a)(iii)).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except (x) in
the case of Fraud or (y) for a breach of or inaccuracy in any Fundamental
Representation (other than as set forth in clause (iv) below), in no event
shall the Purchaser be liable for indemnification pursuant to Section
8.03(a)(i):

(i) for any individual claim where the Losses relating to such claim (or other
claims arising from substantially the same facts or circumstances) is less
than the Individual Basket Amount (and any such items shall not be aggregated
for purposes of this Section 8.06(b)(i)); provided, however, that if such
amount is exceeded, the Seller Indemnified Party may seek indemnification
hereunder for any and all such Losses with respect to such claim (or claims)
in excess of such threshold;

(ii) unless and until any Losses as to which the Seller Indemnified Parties
otherwise may be entitled to indemnification hereunder exceed the Deductible
Amount; provided, however, that after the aggregate amount of all
indemnifiable Losses exceeding the Individual Basket Amount with respect
thereto exceeds the Deductible Amount, the Seller Indemnified Parties shall,
in the aggregate, be entitled to indemnification only to the extent the
aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds the Deductible Amount;

(iii) to the extent that the aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds the Cap;
provided, however, that all Losses of the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be
(1) applied first to satisfy the Deductible Amount as provided in Section
8.06(b)(ii) and (2) then recovered from the Purchaser, up to a maximum amount
not to exceed the difference between the Cap and the Deductible Amount; and

(iv) for any Losses related to a breach of or inaccuracy in a Fundamental
Representation under the Agreement, to the extent the aggregate amount of such
Losses (together with all other Losses) exceeds the Final Purchase Price.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the amounts owed
(if any) by Purchaser to the Sellers pursuant to Article 10 shall not be
subject to the limitations contained in this Section 8.06(b).

(c) An Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to double recovery for any
Losses. In calculating amounts payable to an Indemnified Party hereunder, the
amount of any indemnified Loss shall be determined without duplication of any
other Loss for which an indemnification claim has been made under any other
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. Without limitation of the
foregoing, an Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnification for
Losses (and the amount of any such Losses shall not be includable in
determining whether the aggregate amount of the Losses exceeds the Deductible
Amount) if and to the extent that the amount of any Losses from any matter has
been taken into account as a reduction to Purchase Price in the determination
of Final Closing Indebtedness, or otherwise in the determination of the Final
Closing Working Capital.

Section 8.07 Losses Net of Insurance, Tax Benefits; Reserves. The amount of
any Loss for which indemnification is provided to a Purchaser Indemnified
Party under this Article 8 shall be net of any tax benefit realized by the
Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to, and in the taxable year of or in
the two taxable years following, such Loss and net of any amounts recovered by
the Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to such Loss under insurance
policies or other third-party sources (in each case, net of any costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the collection of any such amounts, and
net of any deductible or increase in insurance premiums as a result of such
Loss). The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided to a
Seller Indemnified Party under this Article 8 shall be net of any tax benefit
realized by the Seller Indemnified Party with respect to, and in the taxable
year of or in the two taxable years following, such Loss and net of any
amounts recovered by the Seller Indemnified Party with respect to such Loss
under any insurance policies or other third-party sources. An Indemnified
Party shall, to the extent practicable and commercially reasonable, submit
claims under and use commercially reasonable efforts to diligently pursue
recovery under all insurance policies under which any Losses may be insured
(other than the RandW Policy). Any amounts recovered by an Indemnified Party and
its Affiliates under any such insurance policies (other than the RandW Policy)
shall reduce the amount of any Loss for which indemnification may be sought
hereunder. A "tax benefit" shall mean, with respect to any Person, an actual
reduction in Taxes payable attributable to any deduction, expense, loss,
credit or refund to such person as a result of such Losses. The amount of any
Loss shall be calculated net of any reserves related to the matter that is the
subject of the Loss, but only to the extent such reserves are expressly taken
into account as a reduction to the Final Purchase Price as a result of the
final determination of the Final Closing Indebtedness.

Section 8.08 Materiality. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, for purposes of determining the amount of any Losses that
are the subject matter of a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article
8, and for purposes of determining whether the representations and warranties
giving rise to such indemnification have been breached or are inaccurate),
each representation and warranty in this Agreement shall be read without
regard and without giving effect to the term, or, as applicable, clause
containing, "material," "materiality" or similar phrases or clauses (including
"Material Adverse Effect" or "material adverse effect") contained in such
representation or warranty.

Section 8.09 Subrogation of Rights. The Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated
to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party, and each Indemnified
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to perfect the above
subrogation rights; provided, that, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
required to perfect the above subrogation rights to the extent the
Indemnifying Party determines in good faith that granting such subrogation
rights would negatively impact the Indemnifying Party's relationships,
contractual or otherwise, with any Person having a business relationship with
the Indemnifying Party.

Section 8.10 Tax Treatment of Payments. The Purchaser and the Sellers agree
that all payments made pursuant to this Article 8, Article 10 or the second
sentence of Section 6.14(c) shall be treated as adjustments to the Final
Purchase Price for all Tax purposes to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law.

Section 8.11 Certain Limitations on Losses With Respect to the Employee
Matters Indemnity and the Specific Indemnity.

(a) With respect to any amounts owed by the Sellers pursuant to any of the
Employee Matters Indemnity or the Specific Indemnity (to the extent such
Specific Indemnity claim is in respect of an Excluded Contract of the type
described in clause (i) of the definition thereof), such amounts shall not
include (i) punitive damages or (ii) exemplary or multiple damages or
diminution in value, loss of profits or loss of business opportunity damages
or other special, incidental or consequential damages and shall not be
calculated by using a multiple of earnings, book value or other similar
measure that may have been used in arriving at or that may be reflective of
the Purchase Price (except, in the case of this clause (ii), to the extent
that any such amounts are or were the reasonably foreseeable consequence of
the circumstances giving rise thereto), it being understood that any Taxes,
interest or penalties imposed by operation of law shall not be excluded from
the scope of the Employee Matters Indemnity or the Specific Indemnity by
operation of this Section 8.11; provided, that nothing in this Section 8.11
shall prevent a Purchaser Indemnified Party from recovering the actual amount
paid by it in respect of any Third-Party Claim that is otherwise indemnifiable
hereunder.

(b) With respect to any amounts owed by the Sellers pursuant to the Specific
Indemnity in respect of an Excluded Contract of the type described in clause
(ii) of the definition thereof, such amounts shall only include (i) Losses
which are awarded to a third party in connection with any applicable Third-
Party Claim, (ii) Losses which are paid to a third party in settlement or
compromise of any Third-Party Claim and (iii) out-of-pocket costs or expenses
incurred by any Purchaser Indemnified Party (including reasonable attorneys'
fees and other professional services fees) in connection with such claim. Any
such Losses shall be paid by Sellers to the Purchaser Indemnified Party (or as
directed by the Purchaser Indemnified Party) on a periodic basis, promptly
following (and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days) such Purchaser
Indemnified Party providing Sellers with reasonable documentation evidencing
any such Losses, whether before or after the resolution of such Third-Party
Claim.

(c) In the event any Purchaser Indemnified Party suffers Losses that are
indemnifiable pursuant to the Specific Indemnity in respect of an Excluded
Contract of the type described in clause (ii) of the definition thereof, and
either (x) the applicable Excluded Contract remains in full force and effect
following final resolution of the applicable Third-Party Claim (which final
resolution shall be deemed to have occurred upon either (i) a final non-
appealable ruling by a court of competent jurisdiction in respect thereof or
(ii) a full and final written settlement of all matters related to such Third-
Party Claim, duly executed by the parties thereto) or (y) the counterparty to
the applicable Excluded Contract dismisses or otherwise withdraws the
applicable Third-Party Claim and waives any breach or default under such
Excluded Contract as a result of the consummation of the Transactions or as a
result of the management of the applicable Specified Hotel by Purchaser or its
Affiliates, which, in the case of either clause (x) or (y), results in
Purchaser or its Affiliate remaining as the hotel manager thereunder, then
such Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be required to reimburse to the Sellers
(on a pro rata basis) an aggregate amount equal to the indemnifiable Losses in
respect of such Third-Party Claim that Sellers have actually paid to such
Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to the foregoing Section 8.11(b);
provided that in no event shall such reimbursement exceed the Residual Value
of the applicable Excluded Contract. For purposes hereof, the "Residual Value"
applicable to any Excluded Contract shall be equal to seventy five percent
(75%) of the Per Hotel Closing Reduction applicable to such Excluded Contract;
provided, that to the extent the terms of the Excluded Contract are amended or
modified in connection with the resolution of such Third-Party Claim under
clause (x) or (y) above in a manner that is materially less favorable in the
aggregate to the hotel manager thereunder, such Residual Value shall be
equitably adjusted in accordance with the provisions hereof to reflect any
change in the value of such Excluded Contract resulting therefrom. In any such
event, the parties will work together in good faith to determine any such
adjustments upon the request of either party. If the parties are unable to
reach an agreement as to such adjustments within thirty (30) days of either
party initiating the process for determination thereof, then the parties shall
submit the dispute to a mutually agreed independent third party valuation
firm, who shall resolve such matters; provided, however, that the valuation
firm may not determine an adjustment that is in in excess of that claimed by
the party claiming the highest adjustment or less than that claimed by the
party claiming the lowest adjustment. The parties shall cause the valuation
firm to make such determination within forty-five (45) days following the
submission of the matter thereto for resolution, and such determination shall
be final, conclusive and binding upon the parties (absent fraud or manifest
error) and may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. The
parties shall instruct the valuation firm to make its determination based
solely upon the written submissions of the Parties (i.e., not by independent
review). Each of the parties agrees that it shall not have any right to, and
shall not, institute any Action of any kind challenging such determination,
except that the foregoing shall not preclude an Action to enforce such
determination.

ARTICLE 9 

TERMINATION

Section 9.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing Date (the "Termination Date"):

(a) by the Purchaser, effective upon written notice addressed and delivered to
the Sellers and the Company, if (i) there shall have been a breach of any of
the representations, warranties, agreements or covenants set forth in this
Agreement on the part of the Sellers or the Company which would, or would be
reasonably expected to, cause the satisfaction of any conditions set forth in
Section 7.02 not to be satisfied prior to the End Date, and (ii) either such
breach has not been waived in writing by the Purchaser, or, if curable, such
breach has not been cured by the earlier of (x) thirty (30) days following the
receipt of Purchaser's written notice of such breach and (y) the End Date;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 9.01(a) shall not be available to the Purchaser if it is then in
breach of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant contained herein
that would or would reasonably be expected to cause the conditions of Section
7.01 not to be satisfied prior to the End Date;

(b) by the Company, effective upon written notice addressed and delivered to
the Purchaser, if (i) there shall have been a breach of any of the
representations, warranties, agreements or covenants set forth in this
Agreement on the part of the Purchaser which would, or would be reasonably
expected to, cause the satisfaction of any conditions set forth in Section
7.01 not to be satisfied prior to the End Date, and (ii) either such breach
has not been waived in writing by the Company, or, if curable, such breach has
not been cured by the earlier of (x) thirty (30) days following the receipt of
the Company's written notice of such breach and (y) the End Date; provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.01(b)
shall not be available to the Company if either the Sellers or the Company are
then in breach of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant
contained herein that would or would reasonably be expected to cause the
conditions of Section 7.02 not to be satisfied prior to the End Date;

(c) by the Company or the Purchaser, effective upon written notice addressed
and delivered to the other party, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
prior to the date that is ninety (90) days after the date hereof (the "End
Date"); provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 9.01(c) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill
any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the principal cause of the
failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date;

(d) by the Company or the Purchaser, effective upon written notice addressed
and delivered to the other party, if there shall be in effect a final, non-
appealable Law or Governmental Order of Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction permanently prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 9.01(d) shall not be available to a party whose failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement shall have been the principal cause of the
foregoing; or

(e) by the mutual written consent of the Company and the Purchaser.

Section 9.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 9.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and of no further force or effect and there shall be no liability on the
part of any party hereto arising under or out of this Agreement except that
the provisions of Section 6.03(a) (Confidentiality), this Article 9
(Termination), and Article 11 (General Provisions) shall survive the
termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing herein shall
relieve either party from liability for Losses incurred by the other party
resulting from (a) the willful and material breach by a party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement or (b) the Purchaser's failure to pay any portion of the Purchase
Price, or any adjustments thereto pursuant to this Agreement, upon
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 7.01
and Section 7.02 (other than those that are satisfied by action taken at the
Closing, provided that such conditions are capable of being satisfied), as and
solely to the extent required by, this Agreement. For purposes of this
Agreement, "willful and material breach" shall mean any deliberate act or a
deliberate failure to act, which act or failure to act constitutes in and of
itself a material breach of this Agreement, if at the time of such act or
failure to act it was the intention of the applicable Person to breach any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement; provided, however, that a failure of either Sellers or the
Purchaser to consummate the Transactions as and when required to do so in
accordance with Section 2.03 upon the satisfaction of the conditions to
Closing set forth in Article 7 (other than those conditions to be satisfied on
the Closing Date, but subject to the written waiver or satisfaction of such
conditions) in breach of this Agreement (in either case, following (a) written
notice from the other party delivered on the date the Closing is required to
occur pursuant to Section 2.03, which notice irrevocably confirms that all
such conditions are satisfied and that the party delivering such notice is
ready, able and willing to consummate such transactions on such date and (b)
the party receiving such notice failing to consummate such closing within five
(5) Business Days thereof) shall be deemed to be intentional and willful,
including in the case of whether or not the Purchaser had sufficient funds
available to consummate the Transactions or take such action.

ARTICLE 10 

TAXES

Section 10.01 Preparation of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes.

(a) The Sellers' Representative shall prepare and file (or cause to be
prepared and filed) all Pass-Through Tax Returns that are required to be
prepared by or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date. The Sellers shall pay all
Taxes arising from allocations of income to them with respect to such Tax
Returns, whether or not shown as due on such Tax Returns. The Sellers'
Representative shall prepare and file all Tax Returns for NewCo and the
Sellers shall pay, or shall cause NewCo to pay, all Taxes in connection
therewith or which are otherwise owed by NewCo. Sellers shall, or shall cause
NewCo to, reimburse the Purchaser, the Company and their Affiliates for any
withholding Taxes imposed on such parties with respect to the direct and
indirect transfers of the shares of Alila pursuant to this Agreement or the
Unaffiliated Member Equity Purchase Agreement.

(b) The Purchaser shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and timely file (or
cause to be timely filed), taking into account extensions, all income Tax
Returns (other than Pass-Through Tax Returns described in Section 10.01(a)) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries for any taxable period ending on or before
the Closing Date for which a Tax Return is first required to be filed after
the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns"). All Pre-Closing
Income Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in
a manner consistent with past practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, with respect to such items, to the extent permissible under
applicable Law. The Purchaser shall provide the Sellers' Representative with a
copy of each Pre-Closing Income Tax Return, together with appropriate
supporting information, at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date
(including any extension thereof) for the filing of such Tax Return for the
Sellers' Representative's review and approval prior to filing such Tax Return.
The Sellers shall (in accordance with their Pro Rata Percentages) pay or cause
to be paid the Taxes, if any, shown due on the Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns
(other than to the extent that the liability for those Taxes is reserved
against in, or taken into account in the preparation of, the Company Financial
Statements).

(c) The Purchaser shall prepare and timely file (or cause to be prepared and
timely filed), taking into account extensions, all income Tax Returns of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all Straddle Periods (the "Straddle Period
Income Tax Returns"). All Straddle Period Income Tax Returns shall be prepared
by treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with past
practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, with respect to
such items, to the extent permissible under applicable Law. The Purchaser
shall provide the Sellers' Representative with a copy of each Straddle Period
Income Tax Return and a statement (or draft Schedule K-1 or applicable
equivalent under state, local or foreign Tax law) specifying the amount of Tax
shown due on such Tax Return that is allocable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
pursuant to Section 10.01(e) (a "Straddle Period Statement"), together with
appropriate supporting information, at least thirty (30) days prior to the due
date (including any extension thereof) for the filing of such Tax Return for
the Sellers' Representative's review and approval prior to filing such Tax
Return. The Sellers shall (in accordance with their Pro Rata Percentages) pay
or cause to be paid the Taxes, if any, set forth on the applicable Straddle
Period Statement for which the Sellers are liable pursuant to Section 10.01(e)
in respect of such Straddle Period Income Tax Returns (other than to the
extent that the liability for those Taxes is reserved against in, or taken
into account in the preparation of, the Company Financial Statements).

(d) The Purchaser shall prepare and timely file (or cause to be prepared and
timely filed), taking into account extensions, all non-income Tax Returns of
the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle
Periods that are required to be filed after the Closing Date (the "Non-Income
Tax Returns"). All Non-Income Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating items
on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with past practice of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, with respect to such items, to the extent
permissible under applicable Law. The Purchaser shall provide the Sellers'
Representative with a copy of each Non-Income Tax Return at least ten (10)
days prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for the filing of
such Tax Return, and the Purchaser shall consider in good faith any comments
in respect of such Tax Return provided by the Sellers' Representative.

(e) For purposes of Section 10.01(c), where it is necessary to apportion
between the Sellers and the Purchaser an income Tax liability of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes for
the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the end of the day
on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any
partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries holds an interest shall be deemed to terminate at that time), and
partnership items shall be allocated using the interim closing method as of
the Closing Date for purposes of Section 706 of the Code. For the avoidance of
doubt, any estimated or prepaid income Taxes paid by the Sellers, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to a Tax Authority prior to the Closing in respect
of any Straddle Period or Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of
the Sellers and shall reduce the amount of Taxes for which the Sellers are
responsible with respect to any Straddle Period Income Tax Return.

(f) The Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates, including the
Company and its Subsidiaries, not to, (i) amend, refile, revoke or otherwise
modify (or cause to be amended, refiled, revoked or otherwise modified) any
Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, (ii) make or change (or cause to be made or changed) any
Tax election that has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) file (or cause to be filed) a ruling
request with any Tax Authority that relates to the Taxes or Tax Returns of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iv)
initiate (or cause to be initiated) any voluntary disclosure or similar
proceedings with any Tax Authority regarding any Tax or Tax Return of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (v) take
any action (or cause to be taken any action) to extend the applicable statute
of limitations with respect to any Tax Return of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case without the Sellers'
Representative's written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Sellers' Representative acknowledges
that withholding consent to an action in the preceding sentence is
unreasonable if such action is required by Law.

(g) The Purchaser shall reimburse the Sellers, in accordance with each
Seller's Pro Rata Percentage, for any additional tax owed by the Sellers
(including tax owed by the Sellers due to any indemnification payment)
resulting from any action or inaction by the Purchaser or its Affiliates,
including any transaction engaged in by the Company or its Subsidiaries
outside the ordinary course of business occurring after the Closing on the
Closing Date, other than any such action or inaction required by applicable
Law.

(h) Except with the express written consent of the Sellers' Representative,
which consent may be withheld in the Sellers' Representative's absolute
discretion, none of Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective Affiliates shall make any election with respect to any
Foreign Subsidiary under Section 338(g) of the Code.

(i) Except as contemplated in this Agreement or the Unaffiliated Member Equity
Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser shall not take or permit any action, and
shall cause each Foreign Subsidiary which is a "controlled foreign
corporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the Closing Date (and
their Subsidiaries, if any) not to take any action or engage in any
transaction outside of the ordinary course of business that could increase
such Foreign Subsidiary's "subpart F income" within the meaning of Section 952
of the Code from the time of the Closing through the end of the tax year of
such Foreign Subsidiary ending on December 31, 2018.

(j) None of the Purchaser or its Affiliates shall take, or cause or permit any
Foreign Subsidiary to take, any action outside the ordinary course of business
of such Foreign Subsidiary on or after the Closing Date (including any
restructuring or Tax election with respect to any Foreign Subsidiary) that
would increase the earnings and profits of the Foreign Subsidiaries for the
Tax periods ending on or before December 31, 2018 and including the Closing
Date, as calculated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes.

(k) The parties agree that NewCo is the sole "withholding agent" (as such term
is defined in the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder)
with respect to the Unaffiliated Member Equity Purchase Agreement. Any amounts
required to be deducted and withheld from the consideration payable under the
Unaffiliated Member Equity Purchase Agreement shall be the responsibility of,
and paid (or caused to be paid) by, the Sellers or NewCo following the
Closing. The Purchaser shall not (and shall not cause or permit any of its
Affiliates to) directly or indirectly deduct or withhold any Tax amounts in
respect of transferred interests in Alila pursuant to the Unaffiliated Member
Equity Purchase Agreement, nor shall Purchaser establish any reserve on the
Closing Balance Sheet in connection therewith, in each case unless withholding
is required as a result of a change in applicable Law after the date of this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary (except in the case of a change in applicable Law described in
the forgoing sentence), for all purposes of this Agreement, the Sellers'
Representative shall determine, in its sole discretion, whether any
withholding Taxes are payable in respect of the transactions contemplated by
the Unaffiliated Member Equity Purchase Agreement.

Section 10.02 Cooperation with Respect to Tax Matters. The Purchaser, the
Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Sellers on the other
hand, shall reasonably cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
the other party, in connection with the filing of any Tax Returns pursuant to
this Agreement and any audit or other action, including any defense thereof,
in respect of Taxes. The Purchaser shall retain possession of, and shall
provide the Sellers reasonable access to (including the right to make copies
of), such supporting books and records and any other materials that the
Sellers may specify with respect to Tax matters relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date, or to otherwise enable the Sellers to
satisfy their accounting and Tax requirements, and shall make employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of such materials, until the relevant statute of limitations has
expired. After such time, the Purchaser may dispose of such material, provided
that, prior to such disposition, the Purchaser shall give the Sellers a
reasonable opportunity to take possession of such materials.

Section 10.03 Tax Contests. The Purchaser, the Company and their Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and the Sellers' Representative, on the other hand, shall
notify the other in writing promptly after (but in no event more than ten (10)
days after) acquiring knowledge of any inquiry, claim, audit, assessment,
proceeding or similar event with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
Straddle Period, or that otherwise may affect the Sellers' liability for
Taxes, with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries (any such inquiry,
claim, audit, assessment, proceeding or similar event, a "Tax Contest"). Any
failure to so notify the other party of any Tax Contest shall not relieve such
other party of any liability with respect to such Tax Contest except to the
extent that such failure shall have prejudiced the defense of such matter. The
Sellers' Representative shall have the right, upon written notice addressed
and delivered to the Purchaser, to control the conduct of any Tax Contest
relating to (a) a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date, and (b) the
pre-Closing portion of a U.S. federal income Tax Straddle Period of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to the extent, in either case, such
Tax Contest could affect the allocations of income to the Sellers, or could
affect the Sellers' liability for Taxes under this Agreement; provided,
however, that (i) the Sellers' Representative shall provide the Purchaser the
opportunity to participate in the defense of such Tax Contest at the
Purchaser's expense, with counsel of the Purchaser's choice at the Purchaser's
expense, (ii) the Sellers' Representative shall keep the Purchaser reasonably
informed of the progress of such Tax Contest, (iii) the Sellers'
Representative shall not settle or compromise such Tax Contest without the
Purchaser's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed and (iv) in the case of any Tax Contest
relating to income Taxes for a Straddle Period, (x) the Sellers'
Representative's control rights shall be limited to those matters affecting
the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date
(but, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any extraordinary items allocated
entirely to Purchaser or its Affiliates pursuant to Section 706 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder) and (y) Purchaser may
direct, in its sole discretion, any Subsidiary of the Company to make an
election under Section 6226 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder with respect to any Tax Contest for a taxable period
beginning on or after January 1, 2018. With respect to all other Tax Contests,
or if the Sellers' Representative has not elected to control the conduct of a
Tax Contest described in the prior sentence within thirty (30) days after
receipt of notice thereof, the Purchaser shall have the right to control the
conduct of any Tax Contest, including any settlement or compromise thereof;
provided, however, that (i) the Purchaser shall provide the Sellers'
Representative the opportunity to participate in the defense of such Tax
Contest at the Sellers' expense (in accordance with each Seller's Pro Rata
Percentage), with counsel of the Sellers' Representative's choice at the
Sellers' expense (in accordance with each Seller's Pro Rata Percentage), (ii)
the Purchaser shall keep the Sellers' Representative reasonably informed of
the progress of such Tax Contest and (iii) the Purchaser shall not settle or
compromise such Tax Contest without the Sellers' Representative's prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed and provided further that the Sellers' Representative
shall consent (or be deemed to consent) to the making of any election under
Section 6226 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder
with respect to any Tax Contest for a taxable period beginning on or after
January 1, 2018. To the extent that a "partnership representative" (within the
meaning of Section 6223(a) of the Code) of any Subsidiary of the Company is an
Affiliate of the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall cause such partnership
representative to cooperate in implementing the provisions of this Section
10.03, including the Sellers' Representative's rights under this Section 10.03
with respect to any Tax Contest with respect to a U.S. federal income Tax
Straddle Period. In the case of any Tax Contest that is also a Third-Party
Claim, the procedures set forth in this Section 10.03, and not those set forth
in Section 8.04 or Section 8.05, shall govern the conduct of such Tax Contest.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Tax Contest relating to
or involving NewCo or any of NewCo's direct or indirect owners shall be solely
controlled by NewCo or NewCo's direct or indirect owners, as applicable, and
the Purchaser shall have no rights hereunder with respect to any such Tax
Contest.

Section 10.04 Tax Treatment. For United States federal, state and local income
tax purposes, (i) the Company, the Sellers, and the Purchaser agree that the
purchase and sale of the Membership Interests shall be treated as a taxable
purchase by Purchaser of the assets of the Company and (ii) the Two Roads
Hospitality LLC partnership, as in existence prior to the contribution of the
Membership Interests to NewCo as set forth in Schedule 2 hereto, shall not
terminate, and NewCo shall be treated as the partnership which is the
continuation of such Two Roads Hospitality LLC partnership.

Section 10.05 Survival. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the covenants and agreements of the parties contained in this
Article 10 shall survive the Closing and remain in full force until the
expiration of the applicable statutes of limitation for the Taxes in question.

ARTICLE 11 

GENERAL PROVISIONS

Section 11.01 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each
of the Sellers, Sellers' Representative, Company and the Purchaser shall bear
its own expenses; provided, however, that the Purchaser shall be responsible
for payment of (i) all costs and expenses in connection with the filings of
the notification and report forms under the HSR Act in connection with the
Transactions, and (ii) all sales, use, real property or stock transfer, real
property gains, transfer, stamp, registration, documentary, recording,
intangible or similar Taxes or charges, of any nature whatsoever, applicable
to, or resulting from, the Transactions, together with any interest,
penalties, fines or fees with respect thereto ("Transfer Taxes").
Notwithstanding Section 10.01 of this Agreement, which shall not apply to Tax
Returns relating to Transfer Taxes, any Tax Returns that must be filed in
connection with Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and filed when due by the
Purchaser. The Purchaser and the Sellers shall, and the Purchaser shall cause
the Company to, cooperate in the preparation, execution, and filing of all Tax
Returns relating to Transfer Taxes which become payable in connection with the
Transactions.

policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of

interests or obligations hereunder to any Affiliate of the Purchaser,
including the assignment of Purchaser rights and obligations hereunder to any
number of its Affiliates, whereby any such Affiliate shall purchase any
Membership Interests as designated by Purchaser; provided, that, no such
assignment shall relieve the Purchaser of its obligations hereunder.

Section 11.07 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be binding

nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to, shall or shall
be deemed to confer upon any other Person other than the parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, any legal or equitable right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, including any third-party beneficiary rights.

Section 11.08 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except

Purchaser, each of the Sellers and the Company by action taken or authorized

Section 11.11 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER
DOCUMENTS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, THE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OF THE OTHER PARTIES HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT ANY OF THE OTHER PARTIES WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.11.

Section 11.12 Public Announcements. Prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers,
the Company and the Purchaser shall not issue any press release or public
announcement concerning this Agreement or the Transactions without obtaining
the prior written approval of the other parties hereto, which approval will
not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed, unless disclosure is
otherwise required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules of any stock
exchange, provided, however, that, to the extent required by applicable Law or
by the applicable rules of any stock exchange, the party intending to make
such release shall, to the extent permissible by such applicable Law or stock
exchange law, permit the other parties to review such release and consult with
the other parties hereto with respect to the text thereof and to consider in
good faith any proposed modifications thereto prior to such release.

Section 11.13 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed by the parties hereto in accordance with their specific
terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Purchaser,
on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the other
(as applicable) and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and to thereafter cause the Transactions to be consummated on the
terms and subject to the conditions thereto set forth in this Agreement. The
foregoing rights are in addition to and without limitation of any other remedy
to which the parties may be entitled at law or in equity. The parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. Each of the
parties hereto hereby waives (a) any defenses in any action for specific
performance, including the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate and
(b) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other security as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. If any party brings any Action to

other party, the End Date shall automatically be extended by (x) the amount of

(y) such other time period established by the New York court presiding over
such Action.

Section 11.14 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by the other parties hereto. For the
convenience of the parties, any number of counterparts hereof may be executed,
each such executed counterpart shall be deemed an original and all such
counterparts together shall constitute one and the same instrument. In the
event that any signature to this Agreement is delivered by facsimile
transmission or by e-mail delivery of a "portable document format" data file,
such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party
executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force
and effect as if such facsimile or "portable document format" signature page
were an original thereof. No party hereto shall raise the use of a facsimile
transmission or e-mail delivery of a "portable document format" data file to
deliver a signature to this Agreement or the fact that such signature was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile transmission or
e-mail delivery of a "portable document format" data file as a defense to the
formation or enforceability of a legally binding agreement and each party
hereto forever waives any such defense.

Section 11.15 Certain Legal Representation Matters.

(a) In any dispute or proceeding arising under or in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions, the Sellers' Representative, the Sellers and
their respective Affiliates shall have the right, at their election, to retain
the firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP (the "Retained Firm") to
represent them in such matter and the Purchaser hereby irrevocably consents
to, and waives any conflict associated with, any such representation in any
such matter. Each of the Purchaser, the Sellers' Representative and the
Sellers acknowledges and agrees that the Retained Firm has acted as counsel
for the Sellers' Representative, the Sellers and the Company in connection
with this Agreement. The parties agree that the fact that the Retained Firm
has represented the Sellers' Representative, the Sellers and the Company prior
to the Closing shall not prevent the Retained Firm from representing the
Sellers' Representative, the Sellers (or any of their Affiliates) in
connection with any matters involving this Agreement, including any disputes
between any of the parties that may arise after the Closing. The Purchaser,
the Sellers' Representative, and the Sellers hereby waive any actual or
potential conflict of interest relating to the Retained Firm's representation
of the Sellers' Representative and the Sellers in the Transactions.

(b) The Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, including, after
the Closing, the Company (and their respective directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, controlling persons and representatives and their respective
successors and assigns), hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all
attorney-client communications between, on the one hand, the Sellers'
Representative, the Sellers and/or the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their
respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling persons and
representatives) and, on the other hand, their counsel, including the Retained
Firm, to the extent related to the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement or any schedule, certificate or other document
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection with the Transactions or
in connection with the Closing and that are subject to the attorney-client
privilege in accordance with applicable Laws, shall be deemed privileged
communications as to which such privilege may only be waived by the Sellers'
Representative or the Sellers, as applicable, and neither the Purchaser nor
any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through the Purchaser shall seek
to obtain any such privileged communications by any process, other than in
connection with any third party or any investigation conducted by a
Governmental Authority.

Section 11.16 Sellers' Representative.

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the Sellers hereby designate Lowe
Hospitality Group, Inc. to serve as the sole and exclusive representative of
the Sellers (the "Sellers' Representative") from and after the Closing with
respect to those provisions of this Agreement that contemplate action by the
Sellers' Representative after the Closing; provided, however, that if Lowe
Hospitality Group, Inc. at any time is unable or unwilling to serve as
Sellers' Representative or resigns as Sellers' Representative, then Lowe
Hospitality Group, Inc. shall appoint a successor Sellers' Representative.
Each successor Sellers' Representative, if required to serve, shall sign an
acknowledgment in writing agreeing to perform and be bound by all of the
provisions of this Agreement applicable to the Sellers' Representative. Each
successor Sellers' Representative shall have all of the power, authority,
rights and privileges conferred by this Agreement upon the original Sellers'
Representative, and the term "Sellers' Representative" as used herein shall be
deemed to include any successor Sellers' Representative.

(b) The Sellers' Representative is hereby constituted and appointed as agent
and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of each of the Sellers. This power of
attorney and all authority hereby conferred is granted and shall be
irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of any Seller, by operation
of Law or any other event. The Sellers' Representative shall promptly deliver
to each Seller any notice received by the Sellers' Representative concerning
this Agreement and the Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Sellers' Representative has full power and authority, on behalf
of each Seller and such Seller's successors and assigns, to: (i) interpret the
terms and provisions of this Agreement and the documents to be executed and
delivered by the Sellers in connection herewith, (ii) execute and deliver and
receive deliveries of all agreements, certificates, statements, notices,
approvals, extensions, waivers, undertakings, amendments, and other documents
required or permitted to be given in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) receive service of process
in connection with any claims under this Agreement, (iv) agree to, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of, assume the defense of claims, and
demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators
with respect to such claims, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate
in the judgment of the Sellers' Representative for the accomplishment of the
foregoing, (v) give and receive notices and communications, and (vi) take all
actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Sellers'
Representative on behalf of the Sellers in connection with this Agreement and
the Transactions.

(c) Service by the Sellers' Representative shall be without compensation
except for the reimbursement by the Sellers of out-of-pocket expenses and
indemnification specifically provided herein. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Sellers' Representative shall have
no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth herein, and no
implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities on behalf of the Company or any Seller shall otherwise exist
against the Sellers' Representative.

(d) Neither the Sellers' Representative nor any agent employed by the Sellers'
Representative shall be liable to any Seller relating to the performance of
such Sellers' Representative's duties under this Agreement for any errors in
judgment, negligence, oversight, breach of duty or otherwise except to the
extent it is finally determined in a court of competent jurisdiction by clear
and convincing evidence that the actions taken or not taken by the Sellers'
Representative constituted fraud or were taken or not taken in bad faith. The
Sellers' Representative shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Sellers
against all losses, including costs of defense, paid or incurred in connection
with any action, suit, proceeding or claim to which the Sellers'
Representative is made a party by reason of the fact that the Sellers'
Representative was acting as the Sellers' Representative pursuant to this
Agreement; provided, however, that the Sellers' Representative shall not be
entitled to indemnification hereunder to the extent it is finally determined
in a court of competent jurisdiction by clear and convincing evidence that the
actions taken or not taken by the Sellers' Representative constituted fraud or
were taken or not taken in bad faith. The Sellers' Representative shall be
protected in acting upon any notice, statement or certificate believed by the
Sellers' Representative to be genuine and to have been furnished by the
appropriate Person and in acting or refusing to act in good faith on any
matter.

(e) Following the Closing, the Purchaser shall be entitled to rely
conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) upon any
actions taken by the Sellers' Representative as the duly authorized action of
the Sellers' Representative on behalf of each Seller with respect to any
matters set forth in this Agreement or related hereto and no party shall have
any cause of action against the Purchaser for any action taken by the
Purchaser in reliance upon the instructions or decisions of, or execution of
documents by, the Sellers' Representative.

Section 11.17 Several Liability. For purposes of clarity and avoidance of
doubt, all representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
Sellers hereunder are several obligations of the Sellers and not joint and
several.
