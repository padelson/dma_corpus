to deduct and withhold from the Arrangement Consideration or any amount
otherwise payable to a holder of Company Common Shares, Company Equity Awards
or other Equity Interests of the Company pursuant to this Agreement and the
Plan of Arrangement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. Any
amounts that are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement and the Plan of
Arrangement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made. To the extent that the amount so required
under applicable Tax Law to be deducted or withheld from the payment of
Arrangement Consideration to a holder of Company Common Shares, Company
Equity Awards or other Equity Interests of the Company exceeds the Arrangement
Cash Consideration otherwise payable to the holder of such Company Common
Shares, Company Equity Awards or other Equity Interests of the Company, each
of the Company, Holdings, Amalgamation Sub and the Arrangement Exchange Agent
(and any such other Person that has a withholding obligation pursuant to this
Agreement) is hereby authorized to sell such portion of the Arrangement Share
Consideration otherwise payable to the holder of such Company Common Shares,
Company Equity Awards or other Equity Interests of the Company as is necessary
to provide sufficient funds to the Company, Holdings, Amalgamation Sub or the
Arrangement Exchange Agent (or any such other Person that has a withholding
obligation pursuant to this Agreement), as the case may be, to enable it to
comply with such deduction or withholding requirement and the Company,
Holdings, Amalgamation Sub or the Arrangement Exchange Agent (or

 



23  any such other Person that has a withholding obligation pursuant to this
Agreement) shall notify such holder of such sale and remit (x) the applicable
portion of the net proceeds of such sale to the appropriate taxing authority
and (y) the remaining net proceeds of such sale (after deduction for the
amounts described in clause (x)) to such holder.

 

(k) _Rights Agreement_. The Company and the Company Board of Directors shall
take all action necessary, immediately prior to the Effective Time, to waive
or otherwise render inapplicable the application of the Rights Agreement to
the Arrangement and to ensure that the Rights Agreement does not interfere
with or impede the success of the Arrangement.

 

Section 2.3 _The Merger_.

 

(a) _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), on the Closing Date, but after the Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Parent. At the Merger Effective
Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Parent
shall continue as the surviving company in the Merger (the "Surviving
Company").

 

(b) _Merger Effective Time_.

 

(i) As soon as practicable on the Closing Date following the filing of the
Articles of Arrangement with the Director and the Effective Time of the
Arrangement, Parent and/or Merger Sub shall file with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger, in accordance with, and in
such form as is required by, the relevant provisions of the DGCL,
with respect to the Merger (the "Certificate of Merger"). The Merger shall
become effective at the time that the Certificate of Merger has been duly
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later
time as the Company and Parent shall agree, in writing and specify in the
Certificate of Merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL;
_provided_ that the Merger shall become effective at the time contemplated in
the Arrangement to the fullest extent possible (the time the Merger becomes
effective being the "Merger Effective Time").

(ii) The Merger will have the effects set forth in this Agreement, the
Certificate of Merger and the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Merger Effective Time, the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and all of the assets, property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of Parent and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Parent and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company,
in each case as provided under the DGCL.

(c) _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Company until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or
by applicable Law. The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior
to the Merger Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Company
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law,
except that references to the name of Merger Sub shall be replaced by
references to the name of the Surviving Company.

(d) _Directors and Officers of Surviving Company_. The directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be the directors of
the Surviving Company until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly appointed, elected and qualified,
as the case may be. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

(e) _Effect on Capital Stock_. 

(i) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Merger Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties, each
share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Merger Effective Time held by Holdings and

 



24  the Partnership, respectively, and all rights in respect thereof, shall
forthwith be cancelled and cease to exist and be converted into one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Company, which shall
be held directly or indirectly by Holdings and the Surviving Company shall
further issue its shares to Holdings and to the Partnership in consideration
of Holdings issuing the Holdings Consideration and the Partnerships issuing
the Exchangeable Security Consideration in accordance with _Section
2.3(e)(iii)_.

 

(ii) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned Stock_. At the Merger Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any
of their respective shareholders, each Parent Common Share that is owned by
Parent as treasury stock and each Parent Common Share that is owned directly
by Holdings, Partnership or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 

(iii) _Conversion of Parent Common Shares_. At the Merger Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties,
subject to the proration procedures set forth in _Section 2.3(f)(iii)_:

(A) each Non-Election Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with
_Section 2.3(e)(ii)_) shall be converted into the right to receive (x) 0.99
Holdings Common Shares (together with any additional Holdings Common Shares
issued pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)(iii)_, the "Holdings Consideration") and
(y) 0.01 Exchangeable Units, in each case, without interest, and

 

(B) each Exchangeable Election Share shall be converted into the right to
receive one (1) Exchangeable Unit (together with Exchangeable Units issued in
respect of each Non-Election Share in accordance with _Section
2.3(e)(iii)(A)(y)_) the "Exchangeable Security Consideration" and together
with the Holdings Consideration, the "Merger Consideration").

All such Parent Common Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time represented any such Parent Common Share (each, a
"Certificate") and each holder, as of immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time, of a non-certificated outstanding Parent Common Share
represented by book entry ("Parent Book Entry Shares") shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the applicable
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Parent Common Shares
represented by such Certificate or Parent Book Entry Share (as applicable)
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time to be delivered in accordance
with  _Section 2.3(e)(iv)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the
date of this Agreement and the Merger Effective Time the outstanding Holdings
Common Shares, Parent Common Shares or Exchangeable Units shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or units or a different class, by
reason of any dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have
occurred, then any number or amount contained herein which is based upon the
number of Holdings Common Shares, Parent Common Shares or Exchangeable Units,
as the case may be, will be equitably adjusted to provide to Parent and the
holders of Parent Common Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event.

(iv) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Holdings Common Shares or fractional Exchangeable Units shall be
issued upon the conversion of Parent Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Parent Common Shares converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Holdings Common Shares
or a fraction of an Exchangeable Unit (after taking into account (x) all
shares of Parent

 



25  Common Shares exchanged by such holder and (y) and proration in accordance
with _Section 2.3(f)(iii)_ shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to (A) such fractional amount such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive multiplied by (B) an amount equal to the
average of the closing sale prices of Parent Common Shares on the NYSE as
reported in the Wall Street Journal for each of the ten (10) consecutive
trading days ending with the second complete trading day prior to the Closing
Date (not counting the Closing Date).

 

(f) _Exchange of Certificates and Parent Book Entry Shares_.

 

(i) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall appoint
a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the payment and delivery of the
Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Merger Effective Time, Holdings or
Partnership, as applicable, shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates and Parent Book
Entry Shares, for exchange in accordance with this _Article 2_ through the
Exchange Agent (all such Holdings Common Shares and Exchangeable Units
deposited with the Exchange Agent are hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund"):

(A) certificates representing the aggregate number of Holdings Common Shares
to be issued as Holdings Consideration (or, if uncertificated Holdings Common
Shares will be issued, Holdings shall make appropriate alternative
arrangements); and

 

(B) certificates representing the aggregate number of Exchangeable Units to be
issued as Exchangeable Security Consideration (or, if uncertificated
Exchangeable Units, Partnership shall make appropriate alternative
arrangements).

(ii) _Election Procedures_.

(A) Each Person (other than Parent, the Company, Holdings, Partnership, Merger
Sub or Amalgamation Sub) who on or prior to the Election Deadline is a holder
of record of Parent Common Shares shall be entitled, with respect to all or a
portion of such Parent Common Shares, to make an Exchangeable Election on or
prior to the Election Deadline to receive only the Exchangeable Security
Consideration on the basis set forth in this Agreement. Each Person receiving
Exchangeable Security Consideration (whether in consideration for a Non-
Election Share or an Exchangeable Election Share) pursuant to the Merger
shall be deemed, by virtue of such receipt of such Exchangeable Security
Consideration and without any further action on any such Persons part, to
have (1) executed the Partnership Agreement as a holder of an Exchangeable
Unit and (2) agreed to the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions of
the Exchangeable Units, including the terms and conditions set forth in the
Voting Trust Agreement.

 

(B) Partnership shall prepare an election form, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent with such provisions as Parent may specify
(the "Election Form") pursuant to which a holder of record of Parent Common
Shares may make an Exchangeable Election with respect to all or a portion of
the Parent Common Shares held by such holder. Parent or Holdings shall mail,
or shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail, the Election Form, together with
the Joint Information Statement/Circular to holders of Parent Common Shares.
Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to specify
the number of shares of such holders Parent Common Shares with respect to
which such holder makes an Exchangeable Election (and, if relevant, the
specific lot of Parent Common Shares to which such election relates) in
connection with the Merger. Any Parent Common Share with respect to which the
Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly completed Election Form
on or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day that is three
(3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (which date shall be publicly
announced by Parent as soon as reasonably

 



26  practicable but in no event less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date) (or such other time and date as Parent may specify)
(the "Election Deadline") shall be deemed to be a Non-Election Share. If the
Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Deadline shall be
similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent shall promptly announce any
such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled Election Deadline, which
rescheduled Election Deadline if necessary shall be at the discretion of
Parent provided that at least one (1) Business Day of advance notice thereof
shall have been provided.

 

(C) Parent shall make Election Forms available as may reasonably be requested
from time to time by all Persons who become holders (or beneficial owners) of
Parent Common Shares prior to the Election Deadline, and Parent shall provide
to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform
its obligations as specified herein and as specified in any agreement with
the Exchange Agent.

(D) Any election made pursuant to this _Section 2.3(f)(ii)_ shall have
been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a
properly completed Election Form prior to the Election Deadline. An Election
Form with respect to Parent Common Shares shall be deemed properly completed
only (i) with respect to Parent Common Shares represented by Certificates, if
accompanied by one or more Certificates duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in
form acceptable for transfer on the books of Parent or (ii) with respect to
Parent Book Entry Shares, upon the Exchange Agents receipt of an "agents
message" by the Exchange Agent or such other evidence of transfer of Parent
Book Entry Shares as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request, collectively
representing all Parent Common Shares covered by such Election Form, in each
case together with duly executed transmittal materials included with the
Election Form. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the Person
submitting such Election Form by submitting written notice that is received
by the Exchange Agent on or prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an
Election Form is revoked on or prior to the Election Deadline, the Parent
Common Shares represented by such Election Form shall become Non-Election
Shares and Parent shall cause the Certificates representing such Parent Common
Shares or Parent Book Entry Shares to be promptly returned without charge to
the Person submitting the Election Form upon such revocation or written
request to that effect from the holder who submitted the Election Form;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a subsequent election may be made with respect
to any or all of such Parent Common Shares if the holder thereof complies with
the procedures, terms and conditions set forth in this _Section 2.3(f)(ii)_.
In addition, all Exchangeable Elections shall automatically be revoked and all
Certificates representing Parent Common Shares and Parent Book Entry Shares
shall be promptly returned without charge if this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Article 9_.

(E) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Election Form, the
Exchange Agent, in consultation with Parent, shall have reasonable discretion
to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and
any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be
binding and conclusive. None of Parent, Holdings, Partnership, Merger Sub or
the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any
defect in an Election Form.

 



27 (iii) _Proration_. If the aggregate number of Exchangeable Units that
would otherwise be issued as Exchangeable Security Consideration to Parent
Shareholders in the aggregate based on the operation of _Section 2.3(e)(iii)_
and the aggregate number of Exchangeable Elections in the absence of this 
_Section 2.3(f)(iii)_ (the "Non-Prorated Exchangeable Units") exceeds the
Exchangeable Unit Election Number, then the Parent Common Shares shall be
treated in the following manner:

 

(A) A unit proration factor (the "Exchangeable Unit Proration Factor") shall
be determined by dividing the Exchangeable Unit Election Number by the total
number of Non-Prorated Exchangeable Units.

(B) Each holder of Parent Common Shares shall receive (i) a number of
Exchangeable Units equal to the product of (x) the Exchangeable Unit Proration
Factor multiplied (y) such Parent Shareholders number of Non-Prorated
Exchangeable Units (the product of clauses (x) and (y), the "Prorated
Exchangeable Units") and (ii) a number of additional Holdings Common Shares
equal to (x) such Parent Shareholders number of Non-Prorated Exchangeable
Units _minus_  (y) such Parent Shareholders number of Prorated Exchangeable
Units.

(C) The number of Exchangeable Units that may be issued to holders of Parent
Common Shares hereunder shall not exceed the number of such Exchangeable Units
that would cause the fair market value of Holdings interest in the
Partnership to be less than 50.1% of the fair market value of all equity
interests in the Partnership (the "Exchangeable Unit Election Number"). The
Exchangeable Unit Election Number shall be determined as of the Closing Date,
taking into account the fair market value of all common units and preferred
units in the Partnership to be held by Holdings as of immediately after the
Merger Effective Time, but disregarding any contingent interests in the
Partnership attributable to any options issued by Holdings, all as reasonably
determined by Holdings.

(iv) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_.

 

(A) Promptly following the Merger Effective Time, Holdings shall send, or
shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder of Parent
Common Shares at the Effective Time (other than any record holder of Parent
Common Shares who has previously made (and not revoked) a valid Exchangeable
Election with respect to all of such holders Parent Common Shares) a letter
of transmittal together with instructions thereto (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or,
in the case of Parent Book Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set
forth in the letter of transmittal).

(B) The holder of any Parent Common Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which such Parent Common
Shares have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_ at the following
time: (x) in the case of Exchangeable Election Shares, promptly following the
Merger Effective Time and (y) in the case of Non-Election Shares; (i) with
respect to Parent Common Shares represented by a Certificate, upon the
surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, or (ii)
with respect to Parent Book Entry Shares, upon the Exchange Agents receipt of
an "agents message", in each case together with a letter of transmittal,
duly, completely and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent; _provided_ that, in either case, any Exchangeable Security
Consideration shall be delivered directly by the Partnership to the holder of
Parent Common Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Parent Common
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of Parent, the Merger
Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing
such Parent Common Share (or, with respect to Parent Book Entry Shares, proper
evidence of such transfer) is presented to the Exchange

 



28  Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.3(e)(iv)_, each
Certificate and Parent Book Entry Share shall be deemed at any time from and
after the Merger Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration such holder of Parent Common Shares
is entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to _Section
2.3(e)(iii)_.

(v)  _No Further Ownership Rights in Parent Common Shares_. The Merger
Consideration issued and credited as fully paid in accordance with the terms
of this _Article 2_ upon conversion of any Parent Common Shares shall be
deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Parent Common Shares. From and after the Merger Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Company of Parent Common Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time. If, after the
Merger Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing Parent Common
Shares or Parent Book Entry Shares are presented to Holdings or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this _Article 2_.

(vi)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Parent Common Shares for six (6)
months after the Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to Holdings or its
designee, and any holder of Parent Common Shares who has not theretofore
complied with this _Article 2_ shall thereafter look only to Holdings for
payment of its claim for Merger Consideration as unsecured creditors, without
any interest thereon.

 

(vii) _No Liability_. None of the Parent Parties, the Company, the Surviving
Company or the Exchange Agent or any of their respective Affiliates shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed as of a
date that is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority will, to the
extent permissible under applicable Law, become the property of Holdings free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

(viii) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Holdings, Partnership, Merger
Sub and the Exchange Agent and any other Person that has a withholding
obligation pursuant to the Merger (without duplication) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to any
holder of Parent Common Shares or Parent Equity Awards pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. Any amounts
that are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. To the
extent that amounts are so required under applicable Tax Law to be deducted
or withheld from the payment of Merger Consideration to a holder of Parent
Common Shares or Parent Equity Awards, each of the Parent, Holdings,
Partnership, Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent (and any other Person that has
a withholding obligation pursuant to this Agreement, without duplication) is
hereby authorized to sell such portion of the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable to the holder of such Parent Common Share or Parent Equity Awards as
is necessary to provide sufficient funds to the Parent, Holdings,
Partnership, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent (or any such other Person that
has a withholding obligation pursuant to this Agreement), as the case may be,
to enable it to comply with such deduction or withholding requirement and the
Parent, Holdings, Partnership, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent (or any such
other Person that has a withholding obligation pursuant to this Agreement)
shall notify such holder of such sale and (x) remit the applicable portion of
the net proceeds of such sale to the appropriate taxing authority and (y) the
remaining net proceeds of such sale (after deduction for the amounts described
in clause (x)) to such holder.

 



29 (ix) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Holdings
or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable and customary amount as Holdings or the Exchange Agent may direct,
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, issue the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

(x) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Holdings Common Shares or units of Partnership
with a record date after the Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Certificate or Parent Book Entry Shares (as applicable)
with respect to the Parent Common Shares represented thereby until such
Certificate or Parent Book Entry Share (as applicable) has been surrendered in
accordance with this _Article 2_. Subject to applicable Law and the
provisions of this _Article 2_ , following surrender of any such Certificate
or Parent Book Entry Share (as applicable), there shall be paid to the record
holder thereof by the Exchange Agent, without interest promptly after such
surrender, in addition to the Merger Consideration, at the time of surrender,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date on or after
the date of the Merger Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the
date of this surrender and not previously paid.

(g) _Parent Equity Awards_.

 

(i) No later than immediately before the Merger Effective Time, Parent and
Holdings shall take such actions as may be required to provide that:

(A) each Parent Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time shall, at the Merger Effective Time, be exchanged for an
option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under
such Parent Option immediately before the Effective Time (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, with respect to vesting), a number of Holdings Common
Shares equal to the number of Parent Common Shares subject to such Parent
Option immediately before the Merger Effective Time at a price per share
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per Parent
Common Share otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Parent Option (each Parent
Option as so adjusted, an "Exchanged Parent Option"); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such conversion shall be effected in accordance with Section 424(a) of
the Code; and

(B) each Parent RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time shall, at the Merger Effective Time, be exchanged for a
restricted stock unit, subject to the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Parent RSU immediately before the Merger Effective Time
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to vesting), with
respect to a number of Holdings Common Shares equal to the number of Parent
Common Shares subject to such Parent RSU immediately before the Merger
Effective Time (each Parent RSU as so adjusted, an "Exchanged Parent RSU").

(ii) At the Merger Effective Time, Holdings shall assume all the obligations
of Parent under the Parent Stock Plans, each Exchanged Parent Option and
Exchanged Parent RSU and the agreements evidencing the grants thereof.

 

(h) _Bonus Swap Program_. No later than immediately before the Merger
Effective Time, Parent and Holdings shall take such actions as may be
required to provide that:

(i) any then-current investment period under a Parent Bonus Swap Program
shall continue in effect in accordance with its terms following the Merger
Effective Time; _provided_ that at the end of each such investment period,
with respect to an applicable participant, such participants elected non-
equity incentive compensation amount shall be used to purchase Holdings
Common Shares and such participant shall be granted options to purchase
Holdings Common Shares, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Parent Bonus Swap Program; and

 



30 (ii) the conversion of Parent Common Shares purchased by participants
pursuant to a Parent Bonus Swap Program into Merger Consideration shall in no
event be deemed a "sale" of any such Parent Common Shares for purposes of such
Parent Bonus Swap Program or any related Parent Option award agreement.

 

Section 2.4 _The Closing_. The closing (the "Closing") of the Arrangement and
the Merger shall take place at the offices of Davies Ward Phillips and Vineberg
LLP, located at 155 Wellington Street West, Toronto, Ontario, at 10:00 a.m.,
Toronto time, on a date to be specified by the Company and Parent, which shall
be no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the satisfaction or
(to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the Party or Parties entitled to
the benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in _Article 8_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
_Section 8.3(e)_ and _Section 8.3(f)_) are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of
those conditions), or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed
in writing between the Company and Parent; _provided_ _that_ , notwithstanding
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article 8_ , if the
Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions (other than those conditions that by their nature (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, _Section 8.3(e)_ and _Section 8.3(f)_) are to be
satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law) waived at the Closing), the
Closing shall take place instead on the earlier to occur of (i) any Business
Day during the Marketing Period to be specified by Parent to the Company on no
less than three (3) Business Days written notice to the Company and (ii) the
Business Day immediately following the last day of the Marketing Period, but
in each case subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in _Article 8_ ;  _provided_ _further_ that, notwithstanding the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article 8_ , if, and only in the
event that, Parent is unable close solely because of the failure and refusal
of the sources of the Debt Financing to fund the Debt Financing when all
conditions to the Debt Financing being funded had been satisfied (other than
those conditions that by their nature (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
_Section 8.3(e)_ and  _Section 8.3(f)_) are to be satisfied at the time of
funding) (a "Financing Failure"), then Parent shall be entitled to delay the
Closing until the expiration of the Alternative Financing Period, if it
delivers to the Company written notice of such a Financing Failure at least
one (1) Business Day prior to the date on which Parent would otherwise be
obligated to consummate the Closing pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ (a
"Closing Failure Notice"), which Closing Failure Notice includes a
certification of a senior executive officer of Parent that confirms that, as
of such date of the Closing Failure Notice the Parent Parties would have
consummated the Closing but for a Financing Failure (for the avoidance of
doubt, the Parent Parties shall not be obligated to waive any of the
conditions for their benefit in _Article 8)_ ; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary hereunder, the Parent Parties
shall be entitled to no more than one (1) Alternative Financing Period. The
date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the
"Closing Date."

 

Section 2.5 _Parent Shareholder Actions; Preparation of Joint Information
Statement/Circular and Form S-4_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable upon receipt of the Parent Shareholder Voting
Agreement and the Parent Shareholder Consent, Parent will provide the Company
with a copy of such document. In connection with the Parent Shareholder
Consent, Parent shall take all actions necessary to comply, and shall comply
in all respects, with the DGCL, including Section 228, the Parent Certificate
of Incorporation and the Parent Bylaws.

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, each of
the Parties shall cooperate in preparing and shall cause to be filed with the
Canadian securities administrators and the SEC (and, if applicable, any other
Governmental Authority) (i) mutually acceptable materials which shall
include (A) the Circular, which shall also constitute the proxy statement
relating to the matters to be submitted to the Company Shareholders at the
Company Meeting, which shall include (in form and substance acceptable to the
Company) matters relating to the Equity Financing as Parent shall reasonably
request, as and to the extent required under applicable Law or stock exchange
listing requirements in order to consummate the Equity Financing in accordance
with its terms (which for the avoidance of doubt shall not in any event
increase conditionality to the Closing, it being understood

 



31  that anything related to such matters, including whether or not approved at
any shareholders meeting, shall not in any event be a condition to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Arrangement and the Merger), together with any other documents required by the
CBCA or applicable Laws in connection with the Company Meeting and (B) the
Information Statement as contemplated by Rule 14c-2 under the 1934 Exchange
Act (clauses (A) and (B), collectively, together with any amendments or
supplements thereto, the "Joint Information Statement/Circular") and (ii) a
registration statement on Form S-4 (of which the Joint Information
Statement/Circular will form a part) with respect to the issuance of Holdings
Common Shares in the Arrangement and the Merger and Exchangeable Units (in
respect of the Merger) (the "Form S-4").

 

(c) Each Party will provide legal counsel and other advisors to the other
Party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on drafts of the
Form S-4, including the Joint Information Statement/Circular and other
documents related to the Company Meeting, the Parent Shareholder Voting
Agreement or the Parent Shareholder Consent, as applicable, prior to filing
such documents with the applicable Governmental Authorities or mailing such
documents to the Company Shareholders or the Parent Shareholders, as
applicable. No filing or mailing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Joint
Information Statement/Circular or Form S-4, as applicable, will be made by
any Party without the consent of the other Parties, which will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing shall not apply to any filings with the SEC deemed to
supplement the Joint Information Statement/Circular or the Form S-4 or any
document which forms a part thereof through its incorporation by reference
therein.

 

(d) Each of the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Joint
Information Statement/Circular cleared by the SEC (and, if applicable, any
other Governmental Authority) and the Form S-4 to be declared effective as
promptly as practicable by the SEC (and, if applicable, any other Governmental
Authority), and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Arrangement and the Merger. As promptly as practicable after such clearance
and declaration of effectiveness, the Company and Parent shall, unless
otherwise agreed to by the Parties, cause the Joint Information
Statement/Circular and other documentation required in connection with the
Company Meeting and the Parent Shareholder Consent to be sent
contemporaneously to (x) in the case of the Company, such Persons as required
by the Interim Order and applicable Laws and (y) in the case of Parent, each

(e) Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Joint
Information Statement/Circular and the Form S-4 comply in all material
respects with applicable Laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC and
Canadian securities administrators applicable thereto and make available to
the other Party such information as is reasonably necessary to comply
therewith, including with respect to the preparation and inclusion of any
required pro forma or audited financial information. Each Party shall
cooperate and provide the other Party with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Joint Information
Statement/Circular or the Form S-4 prior to filing such amendment or
supplement with the SEC or any relevant Canadian securities administrators,
and each Party will provide the other Party with a copy of all such filings
made with the SEC or any relevant Canadian securities administrators.

(f) Each Party shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders of
its Equity Interests as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation and filing of the Joint Information Statement/Circular or the Form
S-4. Each Party will advise the other Party, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, the
issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the
Holdings Common Shares and/or the Exchangeable Units issuable in connection
with the Arrangement and the Merger, as applicable, for offering or sale in
any

 



32  jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC or any relevant Canadian securities
administrators (or, if applicable, any other Governmental Authority) for
amendment of the Joint Information Statement/Circular or the Form S-4.

(g) If, at any time prior to the Closing, any information relating to any of
the Parties or their respective Affiliates, officers or directors is
discovered by any Party, and either Party could reasonably believe that such
information is required to be or should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Joint Information Statement/Circular or the Form S-4 so
that the Joint Information Statement/Circular or Form S-4, as applicable,
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties and, to the
extent required by applicable Law or the rules and regulations of the SEC or
any relevant Canadian securities administrators, an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information, the Parties hereto shall cause to be
promptly filed with the SEC and Canadian securities administrators (or, if
applicable, any other Governmental Authority) and, to the extent required by
Law, disseminated to the Company Shareholders and the Parent Shareholders.

 

(h) The Joint Information Statement/Circular shall include:

 

(i) subject to the terms and conditions set forth in _Section 6.4_, the
Company Recommendation (unless the Company shall have effected a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with the terms of this Agreement),
the Company Fairness Opinions, the rationale for the Company Recommendation
(unless the Company shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) and a statement that,
to the Knowledge of the Company, each director of the Company intends to vote
all Company Common Shares held by him or her in favor of the
Arrangement Resolution at the Company Meeting; and

effective for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval.

(b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including _Section 6.4_), the
Company shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from the Company
Shareholders proxies in favor of the approval of the Arrangement Resolution
and take all other actions reasonably requested by Parent to obtain the
approval of the Arrangement by the Company Shareholders, if so requested and
at Parents expense, including using the services of investment dealers and
proxy solicitation agents, and cooperating with any Persons engaged by Parent,
to solicit proxies in favor of the approval of the Arrangement Resolution and
take all other actions reasonably requested by Parent to obtain the Company
Shareholder Approval and such other matters as may be necessary to be approved
in connection with the Merger and (ii) permit Parent to assist, and consult
with Parent and keep Parent apprised, with respect to such solicitation and
other related actions. The Company shall, prior to the Company Meeting, keep
Parent reasonably informed of the number of proxy votes received in respect
of matters to be acted upon at the Company Meeting, and in any event shall
provide such number promptly upon the request of Parent or its
Representatives.

 

(c) The Company shall not adjourn, postpone, delay or cancel (or propose for
adjournment, postponement, delay or cancellation) the Company Meeting without
Parents prior written consent; _provided_ that the Company shall be permitted
to adjourn, delay or postpone convening the Company Meeting if (A) the failure
to adjourn, delay or postpone the Company Meeting would not, based upon

 



33  the advice of outside legal counsel, allow sufficient time under applicable
Law for the distribution of any required supplement or amendment to the Joint
Information Statement/Circular or Form S-4 or (B) in accordance with _Section
6.4(e)_, (C) in accordance with _Section 8.5_, or (D) as of the time the
Company Meeting is scheduled to occur (as set forth in the Interim Order),
there are insufficient Company Common Shares represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Meeting, but only until the Company Meeting can be held at which there
are a sufficient number of Company Common Shares represented to constitute a
quorum; _provided_ that the Company Meeting shall not be postponed or
adjourned to a date that is more than fifteen (15) days after the date for
which the Company Meeting was originally scheduled.

Disclosure Record under any other captions to the extent the disclosures are
predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature, but it being understood
that this clause (i) shall not be applicable to _Section 3.3_ (Capital
Structure), _Section 3.4_ (Authority; Recommendation), _Section 3.23_
(Information Supplied), _Section 3.25_ (Takeover Statutes), _Section 3.26_
(Brokers and Other Advisors) and _Section 3.27_ (Opinions of Financial
Advisors), or (ii) as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company

existence) as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
other than where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing

Company Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of the Articles of
Incorporation of the Company (the "Company Articles of Incorporation") and the
Amended and Restated By-law No. 1 of the Company (the "Company Bylaws"), in
each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, are included in the

Parent prior to the date hereof.

 

Section 3.2 _Subsidiaries_. The chart attached to _Section 3.2_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date set forth therein, each
Subsidiary of the Company. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or
other Equity Interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company have been validly

Liens. Except for its interests in its Subsidiaries, the Company does not own,
directly or indirectly, any capital stock of, or other Equity Interests in,
any corporation, partnership, joint venture, association or other entity.
There are no options, warrants, rights, convertible or exchangeable

kind to which any Subsidiary of the Company is a party or by which any of
them is bound (a) obligating any such Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or

other voting securities of or Equity Interests in, or any security
convertible or exchangeable for any shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of or Equity Interest in, any Subsidiary of the Company, (b)
obligating any such Subsidiary to issue, grant or enter into any such
option, warrant, right, security, unit, Contract or undertaking, or (c)
giving any Person the right to receive any economic interest of a nature
accruing to the holders of capital stock of any of the Companys Subsidiaries,

are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock or options, warrants,
rights, convertible or exchangeable securities, stock-based performance units
or other rights to acquire shares of capital stock of the Company, other than
pursuant to the Company Stock Plans, the Company Equity Awards and the 2014
Share Repurchase Program and the Companys Direct Share Purchase and Dividend

this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby do not, and the
consummation of the Arrangement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and thereby and compliance with the provisions
of this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby will not,
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of

the Company or its Subsidiaries, other than, in the case of clause (b) above,
any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights, losses or Liens that would

Authority is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby by the Company or

administrators (and, if applicable, any other Governmental Authority) of the
Joint Information Statement/Circular and the Form S-4, (D) the Required
Regulatory Approvals, or (E) any other Authorizations, Orders, Permits,

the same would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or could not reasonably be expected
to prevent or significantly impede or materially delay the completion of the
Arrangement or the Merger.

Section 3.6 _Securities Laws Matters; Financial Statements; Undisclosed
Liabilities_.

(a) The Company is (i) a "reporting issuer" within the meaning of applicable
Canadian Securities Laws in all provinces and territories of Canada, (ii) a
foreign private issuer within the meaning of the 1934 Exchange Act, and (iii)
not on the list of reporting issuers in default under applicable Canadian
Securities Laws, and neither the SEC nor any other securities commission or
similar regulatory authority has issued any order preventing or suspending
trading of any securities of the Company, and the Company is in compliance in
all material respects with applicable Canadian Securities Laws and applicable
U.S. Securities Laws. Trading in the Company Common Shares on the TSX and the
NYSE is not currently halted or suspended. No delisting, suspension of
trading or cease trading order with respect to any securities of the Company
is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened. Except as set
forth in this _Section 3.6_ or on _Section 3.6_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to
continuous disclosure or other public reporting requirements under any
securities Laws other than under Canadian Securities Laws and the Exchange
Act.

 

(b) The Company has filed all material reports, schedules, forms, statements
and other documents with Canadian securities administrators or the SEC
required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Canadian Securities Laws or
U.S. Securities Laws since August 1, 2012. As of their respective effective
dates (in the case of Company Public Disclosure Records that are registration
statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the 1933 Securities Act) and
as of their respective dates of filing (in the case of all other Company
Public Disclosure Records), the Company Public Disclosure Records complied as
to form in all material respects with the requirements of Canadian Securities
Laws and U.S. Securities Laws, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of Canadian securities administrators and the SEC promulgated
thereunder applicable thereto, and except to the extent amended or superseded
by a subsequent filing with Canadian securities administrators or the SEC
prior to the date of this Agreement, as of such respective dates, none of the
Company Public Disclosure Records contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date
hereof, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters
from the SEC staff or staff of any Canadian securities administrator with
respect to any of the Company Public Disclosure Records. To the Knowledge of
the Company, as of the date hereof, none of the Company Public Disclosure

material respects with Canadian Securities Laws, U.S. Securities Laws and the
published rules and regulations of the Canadian securities administrators and
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the period involved
except (i) as otherwise stated in the notes to such statements or, in the case
of the Company Annual Financial Statements, in the auditors report thereon
and (ii) that the Company Interim Financial Statements are subject to normal
period-end adjustments and may omit certain financial statement footnote
disclosures (none of which are material to the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole). The Company Financial Statements fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the

 



37  Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof
and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of the Company Interim Financial
Statements, to normal period-end adjustments and the absence of footnotes
(none of which are material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole)).

 

(d) Except for matters reflected or reserved against in the most recent
audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company (or the notes thereto)
included in the Company Public Disclosure Record, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations (whether absolute,
accrued, contingent, fixed or otherwise) of any nature that would be
required under GAAP, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company (including the notes
thereto), except liabilities and obligations that (i) were incurred since the
date of such balance sheet in the ordinary course of business, (ii) are
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
or (iii) would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.7 _Internal Controls_.

 

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintained a system
of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under
the 1934 Exchange Act). Such internal controls provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and the
preparation of Company financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP. Since August 1, 2012, the Companys principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to the
Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board of Directors
(i) all known significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any material respects the Companys ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any
known fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls and
the Company has provided to Parent copies of any material written materials
relating to each of the foregoing. The Company has made available to Parent
all such disclosures made by management to the Companys auditors and audit
committee from August 1, 2012 to the date of this Agreement.

(b) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Exchange
Act) and such disclosure controls and procedures are designed so that material
information relating to the Company required to be included in reports filed
under the 1934 Exchange Act, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made
known to the Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer, and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
alerting the Companys principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer to material information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits to the SEC under the 1934
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.

(c) Since August 1, 2012, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has

in Rule 3b-7 under the 1934 Exchange Act) or director of the Company. There
are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7
under the 1934 Exchange Act) or director of the Company.

 

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has or is subject to any
"Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of
Regulation S-K promulgated under the 1933 Securities Act).

(e) There have not been during the preceding three (3) years any
transactions, Contracts or understandings or series of related transactions,
Contracts or understandings, nor are there any of the foregoing currently
proposed, that (if proposed but not having been consummated or executed, or
if consummated or executed) would be required to be disclosed under Item 404
of Regulation S-K

 



38  promulgated under the 1933 Securities Act that have not been disclosed in
the Company Public Disclosure Record filed prior to the date hereof.

 

(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, no related party of the Company is
entitled to receive as a consequence of the Arrangement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement any collateral benefit,

collateral benefit where either (i) the related party, together with its
associated entities beneficially owns or exercises control or direction over
less than one percent of the outstanding Company Common Shares or (ii) the
requirements of clause (c)(iv)(B)(I) and (II) of the definition of
collateral benefit have been satisfied with respect to that benefit and the
Company will provide the disclosure contemplated by clause (c)(iv)(B)(III) in
the definition of collateral benefit in the Joint Information
Statement/Circular. The terms "related party", "associated entity" and
"collateral benefit" are used in this paragraph as defined in Multilateral
Instrument 61-101 _Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special
Transactions_.

 

Section 3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Between December 29, 2013
and the date of this Agreement, (a) there has not been any fact,
circumstance, change, effect, event or occurrence that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and (b) the
Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses only in the
ordinary course of business, and, except as set forth in _Section 3.8_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, there has not been any circumstance, action or
activity, which, if taken after the date hereof, would be a violation of
_Section 6.1(b)(ii)_, _Section 6.1(b)(iii)_, _Section 6.1(b)(iv)_, _Section
6.1(b)(viii)_ or _Section 6.1(b)(xxi)_.

litigation, action, charge, complaint, arbitration, mediation, grievance or
other proceeding brought, conducted or heard by or before any court or other
Governmental Authority (each, a "Litigation") pending or, to the Knowledge of

Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no Order
outstanding against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually
or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. This _Section 3.9_ does not relate to tax matters, which are
the subject of _Section 3.14_ or environmental matters, which are the subject

1933 Securities Act (any such Contract, a "Company Material Contract").

 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has made available to Parent
true and complete copies of each Company Material Contract. Each of the
Company Material Contracts is valid and binding on the Company or the
Subsidiary of the Company party thereto and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
each other party thereto, and is in full force and effect, except for such
failures to be valid and binding or to be in full force and effect that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no default under any Company
Material Contract by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, by any other party thereto, and no event has
occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would
constitute a default thereunder by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, by any other party thereto, in each case
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. This _Section 3.10_ does not
relate to Company Benefit Agreements or Company Benefit Plans, which are the
subject of _Section 3.13_, real property leases, which are the subject of
_Section 3.15_, or agreements entered into with franchisees, which are the
subject of _Section 3.19_.

2012, in compliance with all Laws applicable to its business or operations
(including Franchise Laws and Relationship Laws), in each case except for
instances of noncompliance that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. This
_Section 3.11_ does not relate to compliance with securities Laws or
financial statements, which are the subject of _Section 3.6_, internal
controls, which are the subject of _Section 3.7_, employee benefit
matters which are the subject of _Section 3.13_, tax matters which are the
subject of _Section 3.14_ or environmental matters which are the subject of

authorizations, registrations, licenses, certificates, exemptions, permits
and consents of Governmental Authorities (collectively, "Authorizations")
necessary for it to conduct its business as presently conducted, except for
such Authorizations the absence of which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the
Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice
that any Authorizations will be terminated or modified or cannot be renewed
in the ordinary course of business, and the Company has no Knowledge of any
reasonable basis for any such termination, modification or nonrenewal, except
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. 

(c) The term "Franchise Laws" means the FTC Rule and any other Law regulating
the offer or sale of franchises, including any pre-sale registration or
disclosure Law. The term "FTC Rule" means the Federal Trade Commission trade

opportunity operator.

Section 3.12 _Employment Matters_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining agreement or other
Contract with any labor organization, union or association. There are not, to
the Knowledge of the Company, any union organizing activities concerning
any employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending or threatened
and no such activities have occurred in the past five (5) years, that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. There are no strikes, slowdowns, work
stoppages, lockouts, or other material labor disputes pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened, against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and no such disputes have occurred within the past five (5)
years. Except as contemplated by this Agreement, to the Knowledge of the
Company, no director, executive, other key employee or group of employees has
any present intention to terminate his, her, or their employment with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect). Since August 1, 2012, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has implemented any employee layoffs not in compliance with the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 or any similar Law.

Company Benefit Agreement.

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning
of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination or
opinion letter as to such qualification from the IRS, and, to the Knowledge of

Benefit Agreement that provides health or life insurance benefits to employees
or former employees (or any of their beneficiaries) of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or to any other Person after retirement or other termination
of service (other than coverage or benefits required to be provided under
Section 4980B of the Code or any similar Law for which the full premium cost
of such coverage is paid by the covered participant or beneficiary).

 

(e) No Company Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or

Effect, no Controlled Group Liability has been or is reasonably expected to be
incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates, other
than liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
(which premiums have been paid when due).

 

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates
contributes to or otherwise participates in or has any current or contingent
liability or obligation with respect to (i) any "multiemployer plan" (within
the meaning of Sections 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), (ii) any "multi-
employer pension plan" (or term of similar import) as defined under the

ERISA).

(g) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, (i) no proceeding, claim, action or lawsuit relating to any

States, and (iii) no Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement is
under, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
notice of, an audit or investigation by the IRS, Department of Labor or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, any other Governmental Authority relating to any
Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement.

 

(h) The consummation of the Arrangement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, alone or in combination with any other event
(where such other event would not alone have an effect described in this
sentence), will not give rise to any material liability under any material
Company Benefit Plan or material Company Benefit Agreement, including
liability for severance pay,

 



41  unemployment compensation, termination pay or withdrawal liability, or
accelerate the time of payment, funding or vesting or increase the amount of
compensation or benefits due to any employee, officer or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether current, former or retired) or
their beneficiaries. No amount that could be received (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property) as a result of the consummation of the
Arrangement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by any employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement, or
otherwise, would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or
would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any indemnity obligation on or after
the Effective Time for any taxes imposed under Section 4999 or 409A of the
Code.

Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement that primarily covers workers
located outside of the United States (each, a "Foreign Company Plan"), has
been established, registered, qualified, funded, invested, operated
and administered in accordance with the applicable plan document and all
applicable Laws and other requirements, and if intended to qualify for special
tax treatment, satisfies all requirements for such treatment. To the Knowledge
of the Company, no event has occurred with respect to any Foreign Company
Plan that is intended to be registered that would result in the revocation of
the registration of such Foreign Company Plan or entitle any Person (without
the consent of the Company) to wind up or terminate any Foreign Company Plan,
in whole or in part, or which could otherwise reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the tax status of any such Foreign Company Plan except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

obligations, other than any agreement or arrangement mandated by applicable
Law. The term "Company Benefit Plan" means each "employee benefit plan" (as

Benefit Agreement), in each case sponsored, maintained or contributed to, or
required to be sponsored, maintained or contributed to, by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or under or with respect to which the Company or any of

(d) The charges, accruals, and reserves for Taxes reflected on the Company

result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit under, or result in
the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries under (other than any such Lien created from any
action taken by a Parent Party) or any right of rescission or set-off under,
any provision of any Company Specified Agreement other than any such
conflicts, violations, defaults, rights, losses or Liens that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

payments made by suppliers and other third parties on account of Company
Franchises purchases from those suppliers and third parties, have been

neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice that
any Authorizations will be terminated or modified or cannot be renewed in the

occurred in the past five (5) years, that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. There
are no strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, lockouts, or other material labor
disputes pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, against Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries and no such disputes have occurred in the past five
(5) years. Except as contemplated by this Agreement, to the Knowledge of
Parent, no director, executive, other key employee or group of employees has

reports referenced in _Section 4.13(b)_ is complete and accurate in all
material respects, and (y) to the Knowledge of Parent, no material changes

employer pension plan" (or term of similar import) as defined under the

Plans that primarily covers workers located in the United States, and (iii) no
Parent Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Agreement is under, and neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of, an audit or
investigation by the IRS, Department of Labor or, to the Knowledge of Parent,

Benefit Agreement.

 

(h) The consummation of the Arrangement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, alone or in combination with any other event
(where such other event would not alone have an effect described in this
sentence), will not give rise to any material liability under any material
Parent Benefit Plan or material Parent Benefit Agreement, including liability
for severance pay, unemployment compensation, termination pay or withdrawal
liability, or accelerate the time of payment, funding or vesting or increase
the amount of compensation or benefits due to any employee, officer or
director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (whether current, former or

Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Agreement that primarily covers workers

established, registered, qualified, funded, invested, operated and
administered in accordance with the applicable plan document and all
applicable Laws and other requirements, and if intended to qualify for special
tax treatment, satisfies all requirements for such treatment. To the Knowledge
of Parent, no event has occurred respecting any Foreign Parent Plan that is
intended to be registered which would result in the revocation of the
registration of such Foreign Parent Plan or entitle any Person (without the
consent of Parent) to wind up or terminate any Foreign Parent Plan, in whole
or in part, or which could otherwise reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the tax status of any such Foreign Parent Plan except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

any such Lien created from any action taken by a Company Party) or any right

the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

Section 5.4 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and
complete copies of (a) an executed securities purchase agreement dated on or
about the date hereof (the "Equity Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (the "Equity Financing Source") will purchase certain
equity securities of Holdings, subject to the terms and conditions therein,
for cash consideration in the aggregate amount set forth therein (being
collectively referred to as the "Equity Financing"), and (b) an executed
commitment letter and corresponding fee letter from the Debt Financing
Sources related to such Debt Commitment Letter (with only the fee amounts,
pricing flex, interest rates (and pricing caps), securities demand and other
economic terms of the 

 



65  market flex (none of which would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the amount or availability of the Debt Financing) redacted) dated on or about
the date hereof (such letters collectively, the "Debt Commitment Letter" and,
together with the Equity Purchase Agreement, the "Financing Letters") from the
financial institutions identified therein (and together with their permitted
assignees, the "Debt Financing Sources") to provide, subject to the terms and
conditions therein, debt financing to Holdings or its Affiliate in the amounts
set forth therein for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (being collectively referred to as the "Debt Financing" and
together with the Equity Financing collectively referred to as the
"Financing"). As of the date hereof, none of the Equity Purchase Agreement
or Debt Commitment Letter has been amended or modified, no such amendment or
modification is contemplated, and none of the respective obligations and
commitments contained in such letters have been withdrawn, terminated,
rescinded, amended or modified in any respect. Holdings or its Affiliate has
fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the
Equity Purchase Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letter that are payable on
or prior to the date hereof. Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance
with the Equity Purchase Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letter, as

Debt Commitment Letter, together with Parent cash, will in the aggregate be
sufficient for the Parent Parties and the Surviving Company to, on and after
the Closing Date, (i) pay the aggregate Arrangement Cash Consideration, (ii)
pay for any refinancing of any outstanding indebtedness of the Company and
Parent contemplated by this Agreement or the Financing Letters and (iii) pay

"Required Payments"). The Financing Letters are in full force and effect as
of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of Holdings and Parent and, to the knowledge of Holdings and
Parent, each other party thereto, enforceable against such party in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, and
the Equity Purchase Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
each party thereto, enforceable against such party in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. No event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to (A) constitute a default or breach on the part of
Holdings or Parent or their respective Affiliates or, to the knowledge of
Holdings and Parent, any other party thereto, under any term of the Financing,
(B) to the Knowledge of Parent, constitute a failure of any condition to
the Financing or (C) to the knowledge of Holdings and Parent otherwise result
in any portion of the Financing being unavailable on the Closing Date. Neither
Holdings nor Parent has any reason to believe that any of the conditions to
the Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be
available to Holdings or its Affiliates in the full contemplated amount at the
time required to consummate the Closing. There are no conditions precedent or
contingencies to the obligations of the parties under the Financing Letters
(including pursuant to any "flex" provisions in the related fee letter or
otherwise) to make the full amount of the Financing available to Holdings or
its Affiliate on the terms therein except as expressly set forth in the
Financing Letters. As of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other
Contracts to which Holdings, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates is a
party related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount
of the Financing, which expand the conditions precedent to the Financing.

Subsidiaries in connection with a Company Acquisition Proposal or proposal
that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal,
(B) representation on to the Company Board of Directors in connection with a

of such tender or exchange offer or take-over bid, or (2) publicly reaffirm
the Company Recommendation (if previously made at such time), (D) adopt,
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend to the
Company Shareholders a Company Acquisition Proposal or resolve or agree to

such a written request for reaffirmation only once for each Company
Acquisition Proposal and once for each increase of price of such Company
Acquisition Proposal), fail to reaffirm publicly the Company Recommendation
within the earlier of (x) ten (10) Business Days after Parent requests in
writing that the Company Recommendation be reaffirmed publicly and (y) two

clause (i) being referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change") or
(ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

 

(e) _Superior Proposal_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, prior to the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained,
but not after, the Company Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement relating to any Company Acquisition
Proposal or recommend a Company Acquisition Proposal which Company Acquisition
Proposal did not arise or result from any breach of this _Section 6.4_;
_provided_ , in each case, that the Company Board of Directors (or any
committee thereof) has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, (x) that failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) that such Company
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the Company Board of Directors (or any committee thereof)
has given Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice of
its intention to take such action (which notice shall include an unredacted
copy of any Company Superior Proposal, an unredacted copy of the relevant
proposed transaction agreements and a copy of any financing commitments
relating thereto, a written summary of the material terms of any Company
Superior Proposal not made in writing, including any financing commitments
relating thereto (such notice a "Company Superior Proposal Notice"), (ii)
following the end of such notice period, during which time the Company Board
of Directors (or any committee thereof) shall have negotiated in good faith
with Parent with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal to the
extent Parent wishes to do so, the Company Board of Directors (or any
committee thereof) shall have considered in good faith any proposed revisions
to this Agreement proposed in 

 



75  writing by Parent and shall have determined that the Company Superior
Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal (taking such
proposed revisions into account) and that failure to take such action would
be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law. In the event that the Company provides a Company
Superior Proposal Notice on a date which is fewer than five (5) Business Days
prior to the Company Meeting, the Company shall be entitled to adjourn or
postpone the Company Meeting to a date that is not more than fifteen (15) days
after the date of such Company Superior Proposal Notice and in the event of
any subsequent material change to the material terms of such Company Superior
Proposal prior to the termination of the Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.1(d)(i)_, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent
an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (i) above and
the notice period in clause (i) shall have recommenced and the condition in
clause (ii) shall have been satisfied again, except that the notice period
shall be at least one (1) Business Day (rather than the three (3) Business
Days otherwise contemplated by clause (i) above).

 

(f) _Disclosure Obligations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company or the Company Board of Directors (or any committee
thereof) from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. or
Canadian federal, provincial or state Law, including taking and disclosing to
its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the 1934 Exchange Act or issuing a directors circular in
accordance with Canadian Securities Laws (or any similar communication to
shareholders), or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the
shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
1934 Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the shareholders of the
Company); _provided_ that complying with such obligations or making such
disclosure shall not in any way limit or modify the effect, if any, that any
such action has under this Agreement.

(g) _Intervening Event_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
prior to the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, but not after,
the Company Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) may effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change involving the actions contemplated by clauses
(i)(A) and (i)(B) of _Section 6.4(d)_ in response to any development, fact,
change, event, effect, occurrence or circumstance that (A) does not relate to
a Company Superior Proposal (which is addressed under _Section 6.4(e)_) and
(B) is not known (or the material consequences of which are not known) to the
Company Board of Directors as of the date hereof if (1) the Company Board of
Directors (or any committee thereof) has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (2) prior to
taking such action, the Company Board of Directors (or any committee thereof)
has given Parent at least three Business Days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action which notice will identify the reasons for the
proposed Company Adverse Recommendation Change, and (3) following the end of
such notice period, the Company Board of Directors (or any committee thereof)
shall have considered in good faith any revisions to this Agreement proposed
in writing by Parent and shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that
failure to effect such Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to this _Section 6.4(g)_ shall not give rise to any
termination right for the Company.

(h) _Actions of Representatives_. Any breach of this _Section 6.4_ by a
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall constitute a
breach of this _Section 6.4_ by the Company.

external legal counsel or external expert of the other and shall not be shared
by such counsel or expert with any other Person;

 

(iii) subject to _Sections_ _7.2(c)(ii)_ , _7.2(c)(iv)_ and _7.2(c)(v)_ ,
respond as promptly as reasonably possible to any inquiries or requests
received from a Governmental Authority in respect of any Required Regulatory
Approval;

 

(iv) permit the other Parties to review in advance any proposed written
communications of any nature with a Governmental Authority in respect of any
Required Regulatory Approval, and provide the other Parties with final copies
thereof unless the timing of the response requested by the Governmental
Authority does not reasonably permit such review or except in respect of
competitively or commercially sensitive information, which competitively
and/or commercially sensitive information will be redacted from the draft
written communications to be shared with the other Parties pursuant to this 
_Section 7.2(c)(iv)_ and will be provided (on an unredacted basis) only to
the external legal counsel or external expert of the other and shall not be
shared by such counsel or expert with any other Person; and

 

(v) not participate in any meeting or discussion (whether in person, by phone
or otherwise) with a Governmental Authority in respect of any Required
Regulatory Approval unless it consults with the other Parties in advance and
gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate thereat
(except (A) where the timing of the response requested by the Governmental
Authority does not reasonably permit such review, (B) the Governmental
Authority expressly requests that the other should not be present at the
meeting or discussion or part or parts of the meeting or discussion, or (C)
where competitively or commercially sensitive information may be discussed,
in which case, with respect to meetings and discussions with the Governmental
Authority, every effort will be made to allow external legal counsel to
participate); and

 

(vi) cooperate in good faith to obtain the Required Regulatory Approvals but,
in the case of a disagreement over the strategy, tactics or decisions
relating to obtaining the Required Regulatory Approvals, the Parent Parties
shall have the final and ultimate authority over the appropriate strategy,
tactics and decisions.

 

(d) Each Party shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, not take
or agree to take any action, or assist, counsel or encourage any third party
not to take or agree to take any action, whether directly or indirectly, after
the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement or the Closing, that would be reasonably likely to (i) materially
delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any permission, approval
or consent from any Governmental Authority necessary to be obtained prior to
Closing, (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Authority
entering an Order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Arrangement and the Merger,
(iii) materially increase the risk of not being able to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any such Order on appeal or otherwise or (iv)
otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Arrangement and the Merger;
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not require any Party to waive any of the
conditions set forth in _Article 8_.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary
(but other than with respect to the Investment Canada Act Approval, which
approval shall be governed by the provisions of

 



78   _Section 7.2(f)_), in order to permit and cause the Closing to occur as
soon as possible and prior to the Outside Date, the Parent Parties and their
respective Subsidiaries shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do,
or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain
the Required Regulatory Approvals (other than the Investment Canada Act
Approval, which approval shall be governed by the provisions of _Section
7.2(f)_) prior to the Outside Date, including proposing, negotiating, agreeing
to and effecting, by undertaking, consent agreement, hold separate agreement
or otherwise: (i) the sale, divestiture, licensing, or disposition of any
part of the businesses or assets of any Party or its respective Subsidiaries;
(ii) the termination of any existing contractual rights, relationships and
obligations, or entry into or amendment of any such contractual arrangements;
(iii) the taking of any action that, after consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Arrangement and the Merger,
would limit the freedom of action of, or impose any other requirement on,
any Party or its respective Subsidiaries with respect to the operation of one
or more of the businesses, or the assets, of the Party or its respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates; and (iv) any other remedial action whatsoever that
may be necessary in order to obtain the Required Regulatory Approvals prior
to the Outside Date, provided that any such action is conditioned upon the
completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Arrangement and the Merger. The Parent Parties and their respective
Subsidiaries shall further take, or cause to be taken, all other action and
do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to
avoid (including by way of entering into an agreement with a Governmental
Authority regarding the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Arrangement and the Merger), oppose, or seek to have
lifted or rescinded, any application for, or any resulting injunction
or restraining or other order seeking to stop, or that otherwise adversely
affects the ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Arrangement and the Merger. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Parent Parties and their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall not be required to take any
action, or do or cause to be done anything, pursuant to this _Article 7_ that
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to cause a
Burdensome Impact.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
the Parent will submit to the Director of Investments under the Investment
Canada Act and enter into written undertakings with Her Majesty the Queen in
right of Canada which, at a minimum, will reflect all of the commitments set
out in  _Section 7.2_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. The Parent will
further agree to include enhanced and/or additional commitments if and as
required to secure Investment Canada Act Approval, _provided_ that such
enhanced and/or additional commitments would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, cause a Burdensome Impact. For the avoidance
of doubt, any enhanced or additional commitments beyond all of the commitments
set out in  _Section 7.2_ of the Company Disclosure Letter and beyond the
expenditures and costs of any matters and related amounts included in the
Companys current strategic plans shall be aggregated with any actions or
other agreements or obligations required pursuant to this _Article 7_ for
determining whether there has been a Burdensome Impact.

(g) No Party shall, and no Party shall permit its directors or officers to,
make any false or disparaging public statement that is reasonably likely to
materially impair the reputation, goodwill or commercial interest of the other
Party or reduce the likelihood of the Closing to occur.

Section 7.3 _Transaction Litigation_. Subject to the other provisions of
this  _Section 7.3_, the Parties shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to prevent the entry of (and, if entered, to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned) any Order that results from any shareholder litigation
against the Parties or any of their respective directors or officers relating
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby including the
Arrangement and the Merger. The Company and Parent shall each give the other
the opportunity to participate in, but not control, the defense or settlement
of any shareholder litigation against such Party or any of its directors or
officers relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Arrangement and the Merger), and no such
settlement of any shareholder litigation shall be agreed to without

 



79  Parents prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each of Parent and the Company shall keep
the other reasonably informed of any shareholder litigation (including
providing the other Party notice within forty-eight (48) hours of the
commencement of any such shareholder litigation of which such Party has
received notice), unless doing so would, in the reasonable judgment of such
Party, jeopardize any privilege of such Party or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect such shareholder litigation.

 

Section 7.4 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Holdings shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company) to, honor all Company Benefit
Plans and Company Benefit Agreements in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately before the Effective Time, except as otherwise specifically
provided herein on in the Plan of Arrangement. During the period of twelve
(12) months beginning on the Effective Time (or, if shorter, during the period
of continued employment of the relevant employee), Holdings shall provide or
cause to be provided to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
of the Effective Time who continues employment with Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately following the Effective Time (an "Affected Employee")
(i) base compensation and cash incentive opportunities that, in each
case, are no less favorable than was provided to the Affected Employee as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) all other compensation and
employee benefits (excluding equity-based compensation), in the aggregate,
that are no less favorable than the value of such compensation and employee
benefits (excluding any value attributable to equity-based compensation)
provided to the Affected Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for the twelve
(12)-month period following the Effective Time, Holdings shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Company to, provide any Affected Employee who experiences
a termination of employment under circumstances that would have entitled such
Affected Employee to severance benefits under either a severance plan or
policy of the Company or its Affiliates applicable to such Affected Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time or a severance plan or policy of
Holdings or its Affiliates applicable to similarly situated employees of
Holdings and its Affiliates at the time of such termination, with severance
benefits at a level at least equal to the greater of those that would have
been provided under the either such severance plan or policy.

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 7.4(a)_, following the
Effective Time, Holdings shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including
the Surviving Company) to, provide the Affected Employees with the opportunity
(subject to the terms of the applicable bonus plan (which shall be no less
favorable than the terms applicable to similarly situated employees of
Holdings and its Affiliates), including with respect to any requirements to
remain employed through the date of payment of bonuses) to earn a full (non-
prorated) annual incentive bonus in respect of calendar year 2015, regardless
of when the Effective Time occurs.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Holdings shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company) to, elect pursuant to
subsection 110(1.1) of the Tax Act and any similar provisions of any
applicable provincial or territorial tax statute in Canada to forgo that
portion of the income tax deduction that Holdings, Parent, the Company, or
any Person not dealing at arms length with Holdings, Parent or the Company
for purposes of the Tax Act, could benefit from in respect of the settlement
of (i) Company Options referred to in this Agreement or (ii) Holdings
Arrangement Options, that is, in each case, attributable to payments to
Company Optionholders that give rise to taxation under the Tax Act. To effect
the foregoing, the parties shall (i) cause Holdings, Parent and/or the
Company, as the case may be, to timely comply with the requirements described
in subsection 110(1.1) of the Tax Act, including the filing of any elections
and the delivery of written notice of such election to each such holder
in accordance with the requirements set out in the Tax Act, (ii) not amend or
revoke any such elections; and (iii) comply in all respects to the extent
reasonably possible to allow the relevant Company Optionholders to benefit
from the deduction provided under paragraph 110(1)(d) of the Tax Act and of
any similar provisions of any applicable provincial or territorial Tax statute
in Canada.

 



80 (d) Parent and Holdings shall cause any employee benefit plans which the
Affected Employees are entitled to participate in after the Closing Date to
take into account for all purposes (including eligibility, vesting, and level
of benefits), but not for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit
pension plan, service for the Company and its Subsidiaries as if such service
were with Holdings, to the same extent such service was credited for the same
purpose under a comparable Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement
prior to the Closing Date (except to the extent it would result in a
duplication of benefits or compensation with respect to the same period of
service). To the extent any health benefit plan replaces a Company Benefit
Plan that is a health benefit plan in the plan year in which the Effective
Time occurs, Holdings shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Company) to use reasonable efforts to (i) waive all limitations as
to preexisting conditions exclusions and all waiting periods with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Affected
Employee to the extent waived or satisfied under the replaced Company Benefit
Plan prior to the Closing Date and (ii) credit each Affected Employee for any
co-payments, deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses paid prior to the
Closing Date under the terms of the replaced Company Benefit Plan in
satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket requirements
for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

(e) Parent and Holdings hereby acknowledges that (i) the Merger shall
constitute a "change in control" (or term or concept of similar import) under
the terms of the Company Benefit Plans and Company Benefit Agreements and (ii)
the individuals set forth on _Section 7.4(e)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter shall have the right to terminate their employment for "good reason"
(or term or concept of similar import) under the terms of the Company Benefit
Plans and Company Benefit Agreements as a result of the occurrence of the
Merger, notwithstanding anything contained therein to the contrary.

(f) The Company may adopt a retention program in accordance with the terms of
_Section 7.4(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(g) Nothing contained in this  _Section 7.4_ shall (i) be construed to
establish, amend, or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement, Contract, policy or arrangement, (ii) limit the ability of Holdings
or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, Contract, policy or
arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any
of them, (iii) create any third-party beneficiary rights or obligations in
any Person (including any Affected Employee) other than the Parties to this
Agreement or any right to employment or continued employment or to a
particular term or condition of employment with Holdings or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, or (iv) limit the
right of Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries) to terminate the employment or
service of any employee or other service-provider following the Closing Date
at any time and for any or no reason.

Section 7.5 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Each of Holdings, the Company, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries
agree that all rights to indemnification or exculpation now existing in favor
of the present and former directors and officers of the Company, Parent or of
any of their respective Subsidiaries (each such present or former director or
officer (i) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries being herein referred to as
a "Parent Indemnified Party" and (ii) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries being herein referred to as a "Company Indemnified Party" and
each Parent Indemnified Party and Company Indemnified Party being an
"Indemnified Party" and such Persons collectively being referred to as the
"Indemnified Parties") as provided in the applicable governing documents of
the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any Contract
by which the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries is bound
and which is in effect as of the date hereof, will survive the completion of
the Plan of Arrangement and the Merger and continue in full force and effect
and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified (except as required
by applicable Law) in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party, with respect to actions or
omissions of the Indemnified Parties occurring at or prior to the Closing.

 



81 (b) Holdings will, or will cause the Company, Parent and their
respective Subsidiaries to, maintain in effect without any reduction in scope
or coverage for six (6) years from the Closing Date customary policies of
directors and officers liability insurance providing protection no less
favorable to the protection provided by the policies maintained by the
Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, which are in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date and providing protection in
respect of claims arising from facts or events which occurred on or prior to
the Closing Date; _provided_ that in no event shall Holdings be required to
expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in
excess of 300% of the sum of, as applicable, (x) the annual premiums
currently paid by the Company or its Subsidiaries for such insurance and (y)
the annual premiums currently paid by Parent for such insurance; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Holdings shall obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, each of the Company and Parent shall, prior to the Closing
Date, and if the Company or Parent is unable to do so, the Surviving Company
as of the Closing Date shall, purchase prepaid non-cancellable run-off or
"tail" directors and officers liability insurance on terms, including with
respect to coverage and amounts, no less favorable to those covered thereby
than the directors and officers liability policies currently maintained by
the Company or Parent, as applicable, but providing coverage for a period of
six (6) years from the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from or
related to facts or events which occurred on or prior to the Closing Date;
_provided_ that the premiums for such insurance do not exceed 600% of the
Companys or Parents current annual premium for directors and officers
liability insurance, as applicable; _provided_ , _further_ , that Holdings may
substitute therefor policies of a reputable and financially sound insurance
company containing terms, including with respect to coverage and amounts, no
less favorable to any Indemnified Party.

(c) The covenants contained in this _Section 7.5_ (i) are intended to be for
the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs, executors, administrators and other
legal representatives and (ii) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which an Indemnified Party has under Law, Contract or otherwise, and
shall be binding on Holdings and any of its successors.

 

(d) If the Company, Parent, Holdings or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, Holdings shall, in each case, ensure that any such successor or
assign assumes all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.5_.

Section 7.6 _Rule 16b-3 Actions_. Prior to the Closing, Holdings, the Company
and Parent shall take all such steps as may be required to cause (a) any
dispositions of Company Common Shares or Parent Common Shares (including
derivative securities with respect to Company Common Shares or Parent Common
Shares, as applicable) resulting from the Arrangement or the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is or
will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934
Exchange Act with respect to the Company or Parent, as applicable, immediately
prior to the Merger Effective Time to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the 1934 Exchange Act and (b) any acquisitions of Holdings Common
Shares, Company Common Shares or Parent Common Shares (including derivative
securities with respect to Holdings Common Shares, Company Common Shares or
Parent Common Shares) resulting from the Arrangement or the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by each individual who may
become or is reasonably expected to become subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Exchange Act with respect to
Holdings to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Exchange
Act.

Section 7.7 _Stock Exchange Listings; Trading of Exchangeable Units_. 

(a) Holdings, Partnership and Parent shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to cause (i) the Holdings Common Shares to be (A) approved for
listing on NYSE, subject only to official notice of issuance, and (B)
conditionally approved for listing on the TSX, subject only to the

 



82  satisfaction of the customary listing conditions of the TSX, and (ii) the
Exchangeable Units to be conditionally approved for listing on the TSX,
subject only to satisfaction of the customary listing conditions of the TSX,
in each case, prior to the Closing, and in each case the Company agrees to
cooperate with such other Parties in taking, or causing to be taken, all
actions necessary for such listings.

 

(b) Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with each other in taking, or
causing to be taken, all actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to
delist Parent Common Shares from the NYSE and Company Common Shares from the
NYSE and the TSX and to cause the Company to cease to be a reporting issuer in
each jurisdiction in Canada and to terminate registration of the Company
Common Shares under the 1934 Exchange Act and terminate registration of Parent
Common Shares under the 1934 Exchange Act; _provided_ that such delisting and
termination shall not be effective until after the Effective Time
with respect to Company Common Shares and the Merger Effective Time with
respect to Parent Common Shares.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
provide to the Parent Parties, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use
its reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its Representatives (including its independent auditors) to
provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent (x) to enable each of
Holdings and Partnership to become a reporting issuer under applicable
Canadian Securities Laws in one or more jurisdictions in Canada and be
qualified to file a prospectus in the form of a "short form prospectus" (as
defined in National Instrument 41-101 ("NI 41-101") _General Prospectus
Requirements_ ) for a distribution of its securities in one or more
jurisdictions in Canada pursuant to section 2.2 of NI 44-101 _Short Form
Prospectus Distributions_ and (y) to otherwise facilitate the sale or resale,
as applicable, by Partnership, Parent or any other holder of Exchangeable
Units over the TSX or any other recognized Canadian marketplace, including:

(i) cooperating with the Parent Parties in making such applications and
taking, or causing to be taken, all such other actions as are necessary to
obtain any consent, authorization, Order or approval of, or any exemption by,
any securities commission or similar regulatory authority that is required
under applicable Canadian Securities Laws or the rules and policies of the TSX
for purposes of clause (x) or (y) above;

 

(ii) assisting with the preparation and filing of any non-offering "long form
prospectus" (as defined in NI 41-101) of Partnership for purposes of clause
(x) above;

(iii) assisting with the preparation and filing of any "base shelf
prospectus" and any "shelf prospectus supplement" thereto for purposes of
effecting an "at-the-market distribution" of Exchangeable Units as soon as
practicable after Closing ("base shelf prospectus", "shelf prospectus
supplement" and "at-the-market distribution" each having the meaning given to
them in NI 44-102 _Shelf Distributions_ ); and

 

(iv) using reasonable best efforts to prepare and furnish to Parent as
promptly as practicable all information and disclosure relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries (and, where applicable, prepared after giving
effect to the Arrangement and the Merger as if the Arrangement and the Merger
had occurred) of the type and form required by applicable Canadian
Securities Laws for purposes of any of the items in any of the foregoing
clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), including applicable financial statements, audit
reports and other financial information and data regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as may be reasonably requested by Parent.

The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to update any information and
disclosure provided to Parent pursuant to clause (iv) above to ensure that
such information and disclosure, (x) if included within an application of the
type referred to in clause (i) above, remains accurate and complete in all
material respects, and (y) if included within a prospectus referred to in
clause (ii) or (iii) above, when taken as a whole, does not contain as of the
time provided to Parent, after giving effect to any prior updates thereto
provided by the 

 



83  Company pursuant to this paragraph, any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact that is required to be stated in such
prospectus or that is necessary in order to make the statements contained
therein not materially misleading. The Company hereby consents to the use of
the Companys logos in connection with any of the materials referred to in
this _Section 7.7(c)_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended, or reasonably likely, to harm or
disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
intellectual property rights.

Section 7.8 _Takeover Statutes_. If any state or provincial
antitakeover statute, "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business
combination," "fair price" or similar statute or regulation (collectively,
"Takeover Laws") is or may become applicable to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, each of the Parties and its respective Affiliates shall use
reasonable best efforts to (a) grant such approvals and take all such actions
as are legally permissible so that the transactions contemplated hereby may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
(b) otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Laws on
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 7.9 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) _Efforts to Obtain the Financing_. Parent shall use, and cause its
Affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing described in the
Financing Letters on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
described therein and in the related fee letter including using reasonable
best efforts (i) to maintain in effect the Financing Letters until the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) to negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect to the financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter (collectively, the "Debt Financing Agreements")
on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter and related fee letter or, if available, on other
terms that are acceptable to Parent and would not adversely affect (including
with respect to timing, taking into account the expected timing of the
Marketing Period) the ability of the Parent Parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein, (iii) to satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions to funding that are applicable to Parent and its Affiliates in the
Debt Commitment Letter and such definitive agreements thereto (other than any
condition where the failure to be so satisfied is a direct result of the
Companys failure to furnish information described in _Section 7.9(b)_ and in
the Equity Purchase Agreement and to consummate the Financing at or prior to
the Closing, and (iv) to enforce (including through litigation in the event of
a material breach thereof by any party thereto) its rights under or with
respect to the Financing Letters. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates
shall agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any waivers of,
any condition or other provision under the Financing Letters without the prior
written consent of the Company to the extent such amendments, modifications
or waivers would reasonably be expected to (A) reduce the aggregate amount of
cash proceeds available from the Financing to fund the amounts required to be
paid by the Parent Parties under this agreement below the amount required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Arrangement and the Merger (including by changing the amount of fees to be
paid or original issue discount) (B) impose new or additional conditions or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Financing in a manner reasonably likely to prevent or delay or impair the
ability of each of the Parent Parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (C) decrease the aggregate Equity Financing
as set forth in the Equity Purchase Agreement delivered on the date hereof
below the amount required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Arrangement and the Merger, or (D) amend or modify
any other term in a manner reasonably likely to prevent or delay or impair the
ability of each of the Parent Parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Arrangement and the Merger,
or adversely impact the ability of the Parent Parties to enforce their rights
against the other parties to the Financing Letters or the Debt Financing
Agreements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall
give the Company prompt (and in any event within two Business Days) written
notice (x) of any actual or alleged breach or default (or

 



84  any event that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to
any of the Financing Letters or Debt Financing Agreements, (y) of the receipt
of any written notice or other written communication with respect to any
actual or alleged breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to
any of the Financing Letters or any definitive document related to the
Financing or any provisions of the Financing Letters or any definitive
document related to the Financing (z) if the Parent Parties determine in good
faith that they will not be able to satisfy any of the obligations to,
or otherwise be able to obtain, some or any portion of the Financing on the
terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Letters
(including any "market flex" provisions) or Debt Financing Agreements prior to
the Outside Date. Upon the occurrence of any circumstance referred to in
clause (x), (y) or (z) of the preceding sentence or if any portion of the Debt
Financing otherwise becomes unavailable, and such portion is reasonably
required to fund the aggregate Arrangement Cash Consideration and all fees,
expenses and other amounts contemplated to be paid by the Parent Parties or
the Surviving Company pursuant to this Agreement, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Arrangement and the Merger) on terms and conditions not less favorable to the
Company or Parent (in the reasonable judgment of Parent) than the terms set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (including the flex provisions thereof).
Any reference in this Agreement to (1) the Debt Financing shall include any
such alternative financing, (2) the Debt Commitment Letter shall include the
commitment letter and the corresponding fee letter with respect to any such
alternative financing, (3) the Debt Financing Agreements shall include the
definitive agreements with respect to any such alternative financing and (4)
the Debt Financing Sources shall include the financing institutions
contemplated to provide any such alternative financing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in
this _Section 7.9(a)_ shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable best
efforts of the Parent Parties be deemed or construed to require, any of the
Parent Parties to (i) seek the Equity Financing from any source other than
those counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the
Equity Purchase Agreement or (ii) pay any fees or any interest rates
applicable to the Debt Financing materially in excess of those contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter (including the flex provisions), or agree to any
"market flex" term less favorable to the Parent Parties or the Surviving
Company than such corresponding market flex term contained in or contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter (in either case, whether to secure waiver of any
conditions contained therein or otherwise). Parent shall keep the Company
informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Financing and provide copies of all documents
provided to the lenders or otherwise related to the Financing to the Company,
and shall provide to the Company, as soon as reasonably practicable but in any
event within three calendar days of the date the Company delivers to Parent a
written request, any information requested by the Company relating to any
circumstance referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z) of this _Section 7.9(a)_.

 

(b) _Financing Cooperation_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to provide to the Parent Parties, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to use its reasonable best efforts to provide to the
Parent Parties, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives, including legal and accounting, to provide, in each case at
Parents sole expense, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is

rights.

Reorganization") and (ii) it shall cooperate with Parent and its advisors in
order to determine the nature of the Pre-Closing Reorganizations that might be
undertaken and the manner in which they might most effectively be undertaken;
_provided_ that the Company shall not be required to effect any Pre-Closing
Reorganization or take any other action (or fail to take any action) pursuant
to this _Section 7.10_ unless the Company determines in good faith that such
Pre-Closing Reorganization or any other action (or failure to take any action)

Companys securityholders in any material respect; (B) result in any material
breach by the Company of its organizational documents, any existing contract
or commitment or any Law; (C) change the form or reduce the amount of the

impede or materially delay the completion of the Arrangement and the Merger
or the receipt of any governmental approvals or consents necessary to satisfy,
or the satisfaction of, any condition to the obligations of the Parties set
forth in _Article 8_ , or (F) otherwise have an adverse effect that is
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries or the Companys securityholders
in the event the Closing does not occur. Parent shall promptly provide written
notice to the Company of any proposed Pre-Closing Reorganization and,
notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.10_ to the contrary, the Company
shall not be required to complete any proposed Pre-Closing Reorganization not
requested by Parent in writing at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to

87  cooperatively and use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare prior to
the Closing Date all documentation necessary and to take all such other
actions as are reasonably necessary to give effect to any Pre-Closing
Reorganization in accordance with this _Section 7.10_. The Parent Parties
agree to waive any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
by the Company where such breach is a result of an action taken by the
Company in good faith pursuant to a Pre-Closing Reorganization requested by
Parent in accordance with this _Section 7.10_. Parent shall promptly
indemnify and hold the Company and its Subsidiaries harmless from and against
any and all direct and indirect liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,

imposed with respect to the accrual or receipt of any indemnification payment
pursuant this sentence and any withholding Taxes required to be remitted by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), judgments and penalties suffered or

Subsidiaries in connection with or as a result of any Pre-Closing
Reorganization requested by Parent in accordance with this _Section 7.10_.

Parties shall permit any of their respective Affiliates to, issue or cause the
publication of any press release or similar public announcement with respect
to, or otherwise make any public statement concerning, this Agreement, the
Arrangement, the Merger

or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without first
consulting with Parent, in the case of a proposed announcement or statement
by the Company or its Subsidiaries, or the Company, in the case of a proposed
announcement or statement by a Parent Party or any of their respective
Affiliates and, in each case, providing Parent or the Company, as applicable,
a reasonable opportunity to comment; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.11_ will not apply to any release
or public statement (a) made or proposed to be made by the Company in
connection with a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any action taken
pursuant thereto, or (b) in connection with any dispute between the Parties
regarding this Agreement, the Arrangement, the Merger, or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing
shall be subject to each Partys overriding obligation to make disclosure in
accordance with applicable Law, and if such disclosure is required and the
other Party has not reviewed or commented on such disclosure, the Party or
such Affiliate making such disclosure shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to give prior oral or written notice to the other Party, and if such
prior notice is not possible, to give such notice immediately following the
making of such disclosure or filing. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing
shall not prevent either Party from making internal announcements to employees
and having discussions with shareholders and financial analysts and other
stakeholders so long as such statements and announcements are consistent with
the most recent press releases, public disclosures or public statements made
by the Parties.

the obligations of the Parent Parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) _Collateral Arrangements_. With respect to any series of notes, debentures
or other debt securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries, if requested by

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section 9.1(d)(iii)_, and no payments

9.2_, unless the Party intending to rely thereon has delivered a written
notice to the other Party specifying in reasonable detail all breaches of
covenants, inaccuracies of representations and warranties or other matters
which the Party delivering such notice is asserting as the basis for the non-
fulfillment of the applicable condition or the availability of a termination
right, as the case may be. If any such notice is delivered with respect to a
matter that is capable of being cured, provided that a Party is proceeding
diligently to cure such matter, no Party may terminate this Agreement unless

failure to perform by its nature or timing cannot be cured by the Outside
Date; _provided_ that the Company is not then in breach of this Agreement such

Agreement and that without these agreements the other Parties would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to timely pay

Parent under this _Section 9.2_) or (ii) Parent be obligated to pay the
Parent Termination Fee more than once.

consideration for the disposition of Parent Parties rights under this
Agreement, and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for, and shall be the

connection with this Agreement (or the termination thereof) or

its Affiliates shall have any further liability with respect to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby to any Parent Party or any of their
respective Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, while the Parent Parties may pursue both a grant of specific
performance in accordance with _Section 10.11_ and the payment of the
Termination Fee under  _Section 9.2_, under no circumstances shall the
Parent Parties be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance of the Companys obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and any monetary damages, including all or any portion of
the Termination Fee.

(f) In the event that the Company shall receive full payment of the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 9.2_ under circumstances where the
Parent Termination Fee was payable, (i) the receipt of the Parent Termination
Fee by the Company shall be in consideration for the disposition of the
Companys rights under this Agreement, and shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages for, and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and its shareholders against 

 



97  the Parent Related Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, any and
all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company or any other Person
in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby (and
the termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination,
and (ii) following such receipt (A) neither the Company nor any other Person
shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding
against the Parent Related Parties or any of their respective Affiliates
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the transactions
contemplated hereby (or the termination thereof) and (B) neither Parent nor
any of their respective Affiliates shall have any further liability with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to the
Company. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, while the
Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with
_Section 10.11_ and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee under _Section
9.2_, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to
receive both a grant of specific performance of the Parent Parties
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
any monetary damages, including all or any portion of the Parent Termination
Fee.

 

Section 9.3 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Section 9.1_, this Agreement shall become void and of no
force and effect and no Party will have any liability or further obligation to
the other Party hereunder, except that (a) the provisions of _Article 1_ ,
_Section 7.1(c)_, _Section 9.2_,  _Article 10_ and this _Section 9.3_

_Section 7.10_ and in _Sections 7.9_ and _7.17_ shall survive any
termination hereof for the maximum limitation period permitted under the Law.

9.2_ or this _Section 9.3_ will (A) relieve any Party from any liability for
any material breach of any covenant contained in this Agreement or any
intentional or willful breach of any covenants, representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement, including any intentional or willful making of a
misrepresentation in this Agreement, or (B) relieve Parent from any liability

that the Company shall have the right to pursue claims for damages on behalf
of the Company Shareholders (including damages based on the loss of the
economic benefits of the Arrangement and the other transactions contemplated
herein, including the loss of premium offered to such Company Shareholders) in
the event of a Parent Partys breach of this Agreement giving rise to any
such claim ( _provided_ that this clause (iv) is not intended to create any
right of the Company Shareholders to bring an action against a Parent Party
pursuant to this Agreement (it being understood that any amounts received by
the Company in connection therewith may be retained by Company)), the Parties
hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties and covenants
set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other Parties hereto, in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement
is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the
Parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely
upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the provisions of _Section 9.2(f)_, _Section 10.4(c)_, _Section
10.7_, _Section 10.12_ and this  _Section 10.6_ (and the definitions
related thereto) shall be enforceable by each Financing Source (and each is an

as trustee for each Financing Source in respect of the foregoing covenants
and accepts these trusts and will hold and enforce these covenants on behalf
of each Financing Source).

 

(b) The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the Parties in accordance with _Section 10.8_ without notice or liability
to any other Person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular
matters.

(c) Except as provided in this _Section 10.6_, this Agreement shall not
confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 10.7 _Amendment_.

 

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended
by the Company and Parent (on behalf of itself and the Parent Parties), by
action taken or authorized by the Company Board of Directors and the Parent
Board of Directors, respectively, at any time before or after the receipt of
the Company Shareholder Approval or the Parent Shareholder Approval, except
that, after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval or the Parent
Shareholder Approval, there may not be, without further approval of the
Company Shareholders or the Parent Shareholders, respectively, any amendment
of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of the consideration to
be delivered under this Agreement to the Company Shareholders or Parent
Shareholders, respectively.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan of Arrangement may only be
supplemented or amended in accordance with the provisions thereof.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, _Section
9.2(f)_,  _Section 10.4(c)_, _Section 10.6_, _Section 10.13_ and this
_Section 10.7_ (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent a
modification, waiver by Parent or termination of such provision would modify
the substance of any of the foregoing provisions) may not be modified, waived
by Parent or terminated in a manner that is adverse in any respect to a
Financing Source without the prior written consent of such Financing Source.

 

Section 10.8 _Waiver and Modifications_. Any Party may (a) waive, in whole or
in part, any inaccuracy of, or consent to the modification of, any
representation or warranty made to it thereunder or in any document to be
delivered pursuant hereto, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or acts of the other 

 



102  Parties (c) to the extent permitted by Law and subject to _Section 10.7_,
waive or consent to the modification of any of the covenants herein contained
for its benefit or waive or consent to the modification of any of the
obligations of the other Parties hereto, or (d) to the extent permitted by Law
and subject to _Section 10.7_, waive the fulfilment of any condition to its
own obligations contained herein. No waiver or consent to the modifications
of any of the provisions of this Agreement will be effective or binding unless
made in writing and signed by the Party or Parties purporting to give the same
and, unless otherwise provided, will be limited to the specific breach or
condition waived. The rights and remedies of the Parties hereunder are
cumulative and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights and remedies available at Law or in equity or otherwise. No single
or partial exercise by a Party of any right or remedy precludes or otherwise
affects any further exercise of such right or remedy or the exercise of any
other right or remedy to which that Party may be entitled. No waiver or
partial waiver of any nature, in any one or more instances, will be deemed or
construed a continued waiver of any condition or breach of any other term,
representation or warranty in this Agreement.

 

Section 10.9 _Severability_. Upon such determination that any provision is
illegal, invalid or unenforceable all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Arrangement and the
Merger, be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

 

Section 10.10 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, the Parties will, from time to time, do all acts and things and
execute and deliver all such further documents and instruments, as the other
Parties may, either before or after the Closing, reasonably require to
effectively carry out or better evidence or perfect the full intent and
meaning of this Agreement.

Section 10.11 _Injunctive Relief_. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties hereto do not
perform their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate
this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree (and further agree not to
take any contrary position in any litigation concerning this Agreement) that
(a) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof (including the obligations of the Parties hereto to
consummate the Closing in accordance with _Article 2_ ) in the courts of the
Province of Ontario without proof of damages or otherwise, and that such
relief may be sought in addition to and shall not limit, diminish, or
otherwise impair, any other remedy to which they are entitled under this
Agreement, at law, in equity or otherwise, (b) the provisions set forth in
_Section 9.2_ are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the
harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and shall not be
construed to limit, diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Partys
right to specific enforcement, and (c) the right of specific enforcement is
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into
this Agreement. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose
the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that (A) the other Parties have an adequate remedy at law
or (B) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction.

Section 10.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered in
any number of counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic
transmission), each of which will be deemed to be an original and all of which
taken together will be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument,
and each Party may

 



103  enter into this Agreement by executing a counterpart and delivering it to
the other Party (by personal delivery, facsimile, electronic transmission or
otherwise).

 

Section 10.13 _No Recourse_. In no event, shall the Company or any of its
Affiliates, and the Company agrees not to and to cause its Affiliates not to,
(A) seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this
Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any source of
Financing or (B) seek to enforce the commitments against, make any claims for
breach of the Debt Commitment Letters or Equity Purchase Agreement, as
applicable, against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, or otherwise
sue, Financing Sources for any reason in connection therewith, including in
connection with Debt Financing commitments or the obligations of Financing
Sources thereunder. Nothing in this _Section 10.13_ shall in any way limit or
qualify the obligations and liabilities of the parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter to each other or in connection therewith or the right of
the Company to seek specific performance against the Parent Parties under
_Section 10.11_.

 

Section 10.14 _Obligations of the Parent Parties_. Parent agrees that:

 

(a) Parent will cause each other Parent Party to perform its obligations under
this Agreement, the Plan of Arrangement and the agreements contemplated
hereby and thereby in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof;

(b) Parent absolutely guarantees, as a principal and not as a surety, to the
Company the full and complete performance by each other Parent Party of its
obligations under this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement and the
agreements contemplated hereby and thereby, including all payment obligations
given or undertaken or expressed to be given or undertaken in this Agreement,
the Plan of Arrangement and the agreements contemplated hereby and thereby
which are to be performed on or prior to the Closing, subject to the
limitations of liability in _Section 9.2(f)_; and

(c) Parent will be responsible for any breach or liability of each other
Parent Party under this Agreement, the Plan of Arrangement and the agreements
contemplated hereby and thereby.

 

(d) Parent hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of performance, filing
of any claim, any right to require any proceeding first against any other
Parent Party.

_Stockholders_ ").

RECITALS

 

A. On August 26, 2014, Burger King Worldwide, Inc., a corporation incorporated
under the laws of Delaware (" _Parent_ "), 1011773 B.C. Unlimited Liability
Company, an unlimited liability company organized under the laws of British
Columbia (" _Holdings_ "), New Red Canada Partnership, a general partnership
organized under the laws of Ontario and wholly owned Subsidiary of Holdings
(" _Partnership_ "), Blue Merger Sub, Inc., a corporation incorporated under
the laws of Delaware and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Partnership (" _Merger
Sub_ "), 8997900 Canada Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of
Canada and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Partnership (" _Amalgamation Sub_ "),
and the Company entered into an Arrangement Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
" _Arrangement Agreement_ ") for the purpose of effecting a business
combination transaction (the " _Combination_ ") upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth therein.

 

B. In furtherance of the Combination, the parties to the Arrangement Agreement
intend that (i) the Company proceed with an arrangement under section 192 of
the CBCA involving the acquisition by Amalgamation Sub of all of the issued
and outstanding shares of the Company followed by an amalgamation of the
Company and Amalgamation Sub, and (ii) Merger Sub be merged with and
into Parent, with Parent being the surviving corporation (the " _Merger_ ")
and a Subsidiary of Holdings.

C. The Stockholders agree to enter into this Agreement with respect to all
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (the " _Parent Common
Stock_ ") that the Stockholders own, beneficially (as defined in Rule 13d-3
under the Securities Exchange Act) or of record, and any additional shares of
Parent Common Stock that such Stockholders may hereinafter acquire.

D. The Stockholders are the beneficial or record owners, and have either sole
or shared voting power over, such number of shares of Parent Common Stock as
are indicated opposite each of their names on _Schedule A_ attached hereto.

 

E. Parent and the Company desire that the Stockholders agree, and the
Stockholders are willing to agree, on terms and conditions set forth herein,
not to Transfer (as defined below) any of their Parent Common Stock, and to
vote all of their shares of Parent Common Stock in a manner so as to
facilitate consummation of the Combination.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, do
hereby agree as follows:

 

1\. _Definitions_. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein
shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in the Arrangement
Agreement. When used in this Agreement, the following terms in all of their
tenses, cases and correlative forms shall have the meanings assigned to them
in this Section 1 or elsewhere in this Agreement.

 

" _CBCA_ " means the Canada Business Corporations Act.

 

" _Expiration Time_ " shall mean the earliest to occur of (a) the Merger
Effective Time and (b) such date and time as the Arrangement Agreement shall
be terminated validly pursuant to Article 9 thereof. " _Transfer_ " shall mean any direct or indirect offer, sale, assignment,
Lien, pledge, hypothecation, disposition, loan or other transfer (by
operation of Law or otherwise), either voluntary or involuntary, or entry into
any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to any
offer, sale, assignment, Lien, pledge, hypothecation, disposition, loan or
other transfer (by operation of Law or otherwise), of any Parent Common Stock
(or any security convertible or exchangeable into Parent Common Stock) or
interest in any Parent Common Stock, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
entry into this Agreement.

2\. _Agreement to Retain the Parent Common Stock_.

 

2.1 _No Transfer and Encumbrance of Parent Common Stock_. Until the Expiration
Time, the Stockholders agree, with respect to any Parent Common Stock
currently or hereinafter beneficially owned by the Stockholders, not to (a)
Transfer any such Parent Common Stock or (b) deposit any such Parent Common
Stock into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or
arrangement with respect to such Parent Common Stock or grant any proxy
(except as otherwise provided herein) or power of attorney with respect
thereto (other than pursuant to this Agreement); provided that any Stockholder
may Transfer any such Parent Common Stock to any Affiliate of such
Stockholder if the transferee of such Parent Common Stock evidences in a
writing reasonably satisfactory to the Company such transferees agreement to
be bound by and subject to the terms and provisions hereof to the same effect
as such transferring Stockholder.

2.2 _Additional Purchases_. Each Stockholder agrees that any Parent Common
Stock and other shares of the Parent Common Stock that such Stockholder
purchases or otherwise hereinafter acquires or with respect to which such
Stockholder otherwise acquires sole or shared voting power after the execution
of this Agreement and prior to the Expiration Time (the " _New Parent Common
Stock_ ") shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement to
the same extent as if they constituted the Parent Common Stock set forth on
_Schedule A_ attached hereto. 

2.3 _Unpermitted Transfers_. Any Transfer or attempted Transfer of any Parent
Common Stock, including New Parent Common Stock, in violation of this Section
2 shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, be null and void _ab initio_.

3\. _Agreement to Consent and Approve; Agreement to Make Exchangeable
Election_.

3.1 _Delivery of Written Consent_. Hereafter until the Expiration Time, each
Stockholder agrees that promptly (and, in any event, within five (5) days)
after the Form S-4 has been declared effective under the Securities Act by the
SEC, such Stockholder shall execute and deliver to Parent and the Company
an irrevocable written consent adopting and approving the Arrangement
Agreement and the Merger, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_. Any such
written consent shall be given in accordance with such procedures relating
thereto so as to ensure that it is duly counted for purposes of recording the
results of such consent. No Stockholder shall enter into any tender, voting or
other agreement, or grant a proxy or power of attorney, with respect to any
Parent Common Stock, including New Parent Common Stock, that is inconsistent
with this Agreement or otherwise take any other action with respect to any
Parent Common Stock, including any New Parent Common Stock, that would in any
way restrict, limit or interfere with the performance of the Stockholders
obligations hereunder or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
adoption and approval by the Parent Shareholders of the Arrangement Agreement
and the Merger and the consummation of the Combination.

 

3.2 _Exchangeable Election_. Each Stockholder agrees that promptly after its
receipt of an Election Form, it shall (i) return such Election Form and
validly make an Exchangeable Election, with respect to all shares of Parent
Common Stock, including New Parent Common Stock, owned by such Stockholder, in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Arrangement Agreement
and (ii) not revoke such Exchangeable Election.

4\. _Irrevocable Proxy_.

 

4.1 _Grant of Irrevocable Proxy_. Each Stockholder hereby irrevocably appoints
the Company and any designee of the Company, and each of them individually,
as such Stockholders proxy and attorney-in-fact, with

 



- 2 \-  full power of substitution and resubstitution, to execute consents with
respect to any Parent Common Stock, including New Parent Common Stock,
beneficially owned or owned of record by such Stockholder, in each case
solely to the extent and in the manner specified in Section 3\. This proxy is
given to secure the performance of the duties of such Stockholder under this
Agreement, and its existence will not be deemed to relieve such Stockholder
of its obligations under Section 3\. For Parent Common Stock, including New
Parent Common Stock, as to which the Stockholder is the beneficial but not the
record owner, such Stockholder will cause any record owner of such
Parent Common Stock, including New Parent Common Stock, to grant to the
Company a proxy to the same effect as that contained in this Section 4.1.

 

4.2 _Nature of Irrevocable Proxy_. Until the Expiration Time, the proxy and
power of attorney granted pursuant to Section 4.1 by each Stockholder shall
be irrevocable, shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest sufficient in
law to support an irrevocable proxy and shall revoke any and all prior proxies
granted by such Stockholder with regard to such Stockholders Parent Common
Stock, including New Parent Common Stock, beneficially owned or owned of
record by such Stockholder, and such Stockholder acknowledges that the proxy
constitutes an inducement for the Company to enter into the Arrangement
Agreement. The power of attorney granted by each Stockholder is a durable
power of attorney and shall survive the bankruptcy, dissolution, death or
incapacity of such Stockholder. The proxy and power of attorney granted
hereunder shall terminate at the Expiration Time.

5\. _Representations and Warranties of the Stockholders_. Each Stockholder
hereby represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

5.1 _Due Authority_. Such Stockholder has the full power and authority to
make, enter into and carry out the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by such Stockholder and
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of such Stockholder enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms, except to the extent enforceability
may be limited by the effect of applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium or other Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors
rights generally and the effect of general principles of equity, regardless
of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at Law or in
equity.

5.2 _Ownership of the Parent Common Stock_. As of the date hereof, such
Stockholder (a) is the beneficial or record owner of the shares of Parent
Common Stock indicated on _Schedule A_ hereto opposite the Stockholders name,
free and clear of any and all Liens, other than those created by this
Agreement or as disclosed on _Schedule A_ , and (b) has sole voting power over
all of the shares of Parent Common Stock beneficially owned or owned of record
by such Stockholder. As of the date hereof, such Stockholder does not
own, beneficially or of record, any capital stock or other securities of
Parent other than the shares of Parent Common Stock set forth on _Schedule A_
opposite the Stockholders name. As of the date hereof, such Stockholder does
not own, beneficially or of record, any rights to purchase or acquire any
shares of capital stock or other securities of Parent except as set forth on
_Schedule A_ opposite such Stockholders name.

 

5.3 _No Conflict; Consents_.

 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Stockholder does not,
and the performance by such Stockholder of the obligations under this
Agreement and the compliance by such Stockholder with any provisions hereof do
not and will not: (a) conflict with or violate any Laws applicable to such
Stockholder, or (b) result in any material breach of or constitute a material
default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
material default) under, or give to others any rights of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a
Lien on any of the Parent Common Stock beneficially owned or owned of record
by such Stockholder pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which such Stockholder is a party or by which such Stockholder
is bound.

 



- 3 \- (b) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any governmental authority or any other Person,
is required by or with respect to such Stockholder in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation by such
Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

5.4 _Absence of Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no legal action
pending against, or, to the knowledge of such Stockholder, threatened against
or affecting such Stockholder that could reasonably be expected to impair or
adversely affect the ability of such Stockholder to perform such Stockholders
obligations hereunder or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
on a timely basis.

6\. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate and shall have no further
force or effect immediately as of and following the Expiration Time.
Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, such termination shall not
relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement by the party
prior to such termination.

 

7\. _Notice of Certain Events_. Each Stockholder shall notify the Company
promptly of (a) any fact, event or circumstance that would cause, or
reasonably be expected to cause or constitute, a breach in any material
respect of the representations and warranties of such Stockholder under this
Agreement or (b) the receipt by such Stockholder of any notice or other
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with this Agreement; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7 shall not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available to the Company.

8\. _Capacity_. Each Stockholder is entering into this Agreement solely in its
capacity as the record holder or beneficial owner of such Stockholders
shares of Parent Common Stock.

9\. _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to vest in the Company any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of
ownership of or with respect to any Stockholders shares of Parent Common
Stock. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to any
such Stockholders shares of Parent Common Stock shall remain vested in and
belong to such Stockholder.

10.  _Miscellaneous_.

10.1 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
determined to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible. 

10.2 _Binding Effect and Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

10.3 _Amendments and Modifications_. This Agreement may not be modified,
amended, altered or supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a
written agreement executed by all of the parties hereto.

 

10.4 _Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement
was not performed in accordance with the terms hereof or was otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to
specific relief hereunder, including, without limitation, an injunction or
injunctions to prevent and enjoin breaches of the provisions of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in the
Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the
State of Delaware (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case, in any federal
court within the State of

 



- 4 \-  Delaware), in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at
Law or in equity. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond
with respect to any such remedy are hereby waived.

[ , 20 ]

including holders of Company Common Shares issued (under this Plan of

(under this Plan of Arrangement or otherwise) in respect of Company Equity

each Selling Shareholder (other than any Selling Shareholder who has
previously irrevocably deposited with the Arrangement Exchange Agent a duly
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal and Election Form) a Letter of

reflect that each such Selling Shareholder has been deemed to have elected to
receive the Arrangement Mixed Consideration) together with instructions

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the only property
delivered to or acquired by a Former Shareholder herein is that which is
stipulated to have been delivered to or acquired by such person in Section

- 12 \- 5.2 _Withholding Rights_

 

Each of Holdings, New Amalco, the Company and the Arrangement Exchange Agent
and any other Person that has a withholding obligation pursuant to this Plan
of Arrangement (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Arrangement Consideration or any amount otherwise payable to a holder
of Company Common Shares or Company Equity Awards pursuant to this Plan
of Arrangement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Tax Act, the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or any provision of provincial, state, local, or
foreign law, in each case as amended ("Tax Law"). Any amounts that are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated
for all purposes of this Plan of Arrangement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. To the extent
that the amount so required under applicable Tax Law to be deducted or
withheld from the payment of Arrangement Consideration to a holder of Company
Common Shares or Company Equity Awards exceeds the cash component of the
consideration otherwise payable to the holder of such Company Common Shares or
Company Equity Awards, each of Holdings, New Amalco, the Company and the
Arrangement Exchange Agent (and any such other Person that has a withholding
obligation pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement), as the case may be, is
hereby authorized to sell such portion of the share component of the
consideration otherwise payable to the holder of such Company Common Shares or
Company Equity Awards as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to
Holdings, New Amalco, the Company or the Arrangement Exchange Agent (or any
such other Person that has a withholding obligation pursuant to this Plan of
Arrangement), as the case may be, to enable it to comply with such deduction
or withholding requirement and Holdings, New Amalco, the Company or the
Arrangement Exchange Agent (or any such other Person that has a withholding
obligation pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement) shall notify such holder of
such sale and remit (x) the applicable portion of the net proceeds of such
sale to the appropriate taxing authority and (y) the remaining net proceeds of
such sale (after deduction for the amounts described in clause (x)) to such
holder.

5.3 _Interest_

 

Under no circumstances shall interest accrue or be paid by Holdings, New
Amalco, the Company or the Arrangement Exchange Agent to persons depositing
duly completed and executed Letters of Transmittal pursuant to Section 5.1,
regardless of any delay in making any payment contemplated hereby.

 

5.4 _Extinction of Rights_

Any registered Company Shareholder that immediately prior to the Effective
Time holds outstanding Company Common Shares that are exchanged pursuant to
Section 3.2 and does not deliver the Letter of Transmittal and Election Form
and such other additional documents and instruments as the Arrangement
Exchange Agent may reasonably require, all as set out in Section 5.1, on or
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date, shall cease to have a
claim or interest of any kind or nature as a shareholder of Holdings or
otherwise. On such date, the cash and Holdings Common Shares to which the
former registered Company Shareholder referred to in the preceding sentence
was ultimately entitled shall be deemed to have been surrendered to New
Amalco and Holdings respectively in accordance with applicable Laws, together
with all entitlements to dividends, distributions and interest thereon held
for such former registered holder.

 

5.5 _No Liens_

Any exchange or transfer of securities pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement
shall be free and clear of any Liens.

5.6 _Illegality of Delivery of Shares_

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if it appears to Holdings or New Amalco that it
would be contrary to applicable Laws to deliver, or cause to be delivered,
Holdings Common Shares pursuant to the Arrangement to a Selling Shareholder
that is not a resident of Canada or the United States, the Holdings Shares
that otherwise

 



- 13 \-  would be issued to that Person will be issued to the Arrangement Exchange
Agent for sale by Arrangement Exchange Agent on behalf of that Person. The
Holdings Common Shares so issued to the Arrangement Exchange Agent will be
pooled and sold as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, on such dates
and at such prices as the Arrangement Exchange Agent determines in its sole
discretion. The Arrangement Exchange Agent shall not be obligated to seek or
obtain a minimum price for any of the Holdings Common Shares sold by it. Each
such Person will receive a pro rata share of the cash proceeds from the sale
of the Holdings Common Shares sold by the Arrangement Exchange Agent (less
commissions, other reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the sale of
the Holdings Common Shares and any amount withheld in respect of taxes) in
lieu of the Holdings Common Shares themselves. The net proceeds will be
remitted in the same manner as other payments pursuant to this Article 5\.
None of Holdings, Amalgamation Sub, New Amalco or the Arrangement Exchange
Agent will be liable for any loss arising out of any such sales.

 _INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY_

 

9.1 _Indemnification of the Trustee_

 

Holdings and the Partnership jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold
harmless the Trustee and each of its directors, officers, employees and
agents appointed and acting in accordance with this Agreement (collectively,
the "Indemnified Parties") against all claims, losses, damages, reasonable
costs, penalties, fines and reasonable expenses (including reasonable
expenses of the Trustees legal counsel) which, without fraud, negligence,
recklessness, wilful misconduct or bad faith on the part of such Indemnified
Party, may be paid, incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Party by reason
or as a result of the Trustees acceptance or administration of the Trust or
its compliance with its duties set forth in this Agreement or any written or
oral instruction delivered to the Trustee by Holdings or the Partnership
pursuant hereto.

In no case shall Holdings or the Partnership be liable under this indemnity
unless Holdings and the Partnership shall be notified by the Trustee of the
assertion of a claim or of any action commenced against the Indemnified
Parties promptly after any of the Indemnified Parties shall have received a
written assertion of such a claim. Holdings and the Partnership shall be
entitled to participate at their own expense in the defence and, if Holdings
and the Partnership so elect at any time after receipt of such notice, subject
to (ii) below, either of them

counsel has been authorized by Holdings or the Partnership, such authorization

include both the Trustee and Holdings or the Partnership and the Trustee shall
have been advised by counsel acceptable to Holdings or the Partnership that
there may be one or more legal defences available to the Trustee that are
different from or in addition to those available to Holdings or the
Partnership and that, in the judgment of such counsel, would present a
conflict of interest were a joint representation to be undertaken (in which
case Holdings and the Partnership shall not have the right to assume the
defence of such suit on behalf of the Trustee but shall be liable to pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Trustee). This indemnity shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of
the Trustee.

9.2 _Limitation of Liability_

 

The Trustee shall not be held liable for any loss which may occur by reason of
depreciation of the value of any part of the Trust Estate or any loss
incurred on any investment of funds pursuant to this Agreement, except to the

wilful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Trustee.

trustee is appointed) be removed at any time on not less than 30 days prior
notice by written instrument executed by Holdings and the Partnership, in

one copy to the successor trustee.

10.3 _Successor Trustee_

 

Any successor trustee appointed as provided under this Agreement shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver to Holdings and the Partnership and to its
predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such appointment. Thereupon the
resignation or removal of the predecessor trustee shall become effective and
such successor

 



- 14 \-  trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested
with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor under
this Agreement, with the like effect as if originally named as trustee in
this Agreement. However, on the written request of Holdings and the
Partnership or of the successor trustee, the trustee ceasing to act shall,
upon payment of any amounts then due to it pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor
trustee all the rights and powers of the trustee so ceasing to act. Upon the
request of any such successor trustee, Holdings, the Partnership and such
predecessor trustee shall execute any and all instruments in writing for more
fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee all
such rights and powers.

 

10.4 _Notice of Successor Trustee_

 

Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided herein,
Holdings and the Partnership shall cause to be mailed notice of
the succession of such trustee hereunder to each Beneficiary specified in a

mailed within 10 days after acceptance of appointment by the successor

thereon, and (ii) the text of any special resolution to be submitted to the
meeting, shall be sent to each shareholder entitled to vote at the meeting, to
each director of the Corporation and to the auditor (if any) of the

of the Act, at any place without notice if all the shareholders and other
persons entitled to notice of such meeting are present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting (except where a shareholder or such other
person attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the
transaction of any business on the grounds that the meeting is not lawfully
called) or if all the shareholders and other persons entitled to notice of
such meeting and not present in person nor represented by proxy thereat waive
notice of the meeting. Notice of any meeting of shareholders or the time for
the giving of any such notice or any irregularity in any such meeting or in
the notice thereof may be waived in any manner by any shareholder, the duly
appointed proxy of any shareholder, any director or the auditor of the
Corporation and any other person entitled to attend a meeting of shareholders,
and any such waiver may be validly given either before or after the meeting to
which such waiver relates.

 

The auditor (if any) of the Corporation is entitled to receive notice of every
meeting of shareholders of the Corporation and, at the expense of the
Corporation, to attend and be heard thereat on matters relating to the
auditors duties.

Any previously scheduled annual meeting of shareholders may be postponed, and
any shareholders meeting other than an annual meeting may be postponed or
cancelled, by the Corporation by public notice given to the shareholders prior
to the date previously scheduled for such meeting of shareholders.

37\. _Omission of Notice_

 

The accidental omission to give notice of any meeting to or the non-receipt of
any notice by any person shall not invalidate any resolution passed or any
proceeding taken at any meeting of shareholders.

38\. _Chair_

 

The Chair of the Board (if any) shall when present preside at all meetings of
shareholders. In the absence of the Chair of the Board (if any), the
President or, if the President is also absent, a Vice-President (if any) shall

shareholders, the shareholders present entitled to vote shall choose a
director as chair of the meeting and if no director is present or if all the
directors decline to take the chair then the shareholders present shall choose
one of their number to be chair.

Votes at meetings of the shareholders may be cast either personally or by
proxy. At every meeting at which a shareholder is entitled to vote, such

is entitled to vote, every shareholder (if present in person or by proxy)
shall (subject to the provisions, if any, of the Corporations articles) have
one vote for every share registered in such shareholders name.

 



- 11 \- Every question submitted to any meeting of shareholders shall be decided in
the first instance on a show of hands unless a ballot is demanded or the
Chair determines that the vote should proceed by ballot. In case of an
equality of votes the chair of the meeting shall not have a second or casting
vote in addition to the vote or votes to which the chair may be entitled as a
shareholder or proxy nominee.

At any meeting, unless a ballot is demanded by a shareholder or
proxyholder entitled to vote at the meeting, either before or after any vote
by a show of hands, a declaration by the chair of the meeting that a
resolution has been carried or carried unanimously or by a particular majority
or lost or not carried by a particular majority shall be evidence of the fact
without proof of the number or proportion of votes recorded in favour of or
against the motion.

 

If at any meeting a ballot is demanded on the election of a chair or on the
question of adjournment or termination, the ballot shall be taken forthwith
without adjournment. If a ballot is demanded on any other question or as to
the election of directors, the ballot shall be taken in such manner and either
at once or later at the meeting or after adjournment as the chair of the
meeting directs. The result of a ballot shall be deemed to be the resolution
of the meeting at which the ballot was demanded. A demand for a ballot may be
made either before or after any vote by show of hands and may be withdrawn.

 

If the chair of a meeting of shareholders declares to the meeting that, if a
ballot is conducted, the total number of votes attached to shares represented
at the meeting by proxy required to be voted against what to the knowledge of
the chair will be the decision of the meeting in relation to any matter or
group of matters is less than 5% of all of the votes that might be cast
by shareholders personally or by proxy at the meeting on the ballot, unless a
shareholder or proxyholder demands a ballot prior to the vote,



     | (a) | the chair may conduct the vote in respect of that matter or
group of matters by a show of hands; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | a proxyholder or alternate proxyholder may vote in respect
of that matter or group of matters by a show of hands, notwithstanding any
directions to the contrary given to such proxyholder or alternate proxyholder
from any shareholder who appointed such proxyholder or alternate proxyholder,
or any conflicting instructions from more than one such shareholder. 
---|---|--- 
 

Where a body corporate or association is a shareholder, any individual
authorized by a resolution of the directors or governing body of the body
corporate or association may represent it at any meeting of shareholders and
exercise at such meeting on behalf of the body corporate or association all
the powers it could exercise if it were an individual shareholder, provided
that the Corporation or the chair of the meeting may require such shareholder
or such individual authorized by it to furnish a certified copy of such
resolution or other appropriate evidence of the authority of such individual.

 

Where two or more persons hold the same share or shares jointly, any one of
such persons present at a meeting of shareholders has the right, in the
absence of the other or others, to vote such share or shares, but if more than
one of such persons are present or represented by proxy and vote, they shall
vote together as one on the share or shares jointly held by them.

 

40\. _Proxies_

A shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders may by means of a
proxy appoint a proxyholder or proxyholders or one or more alternate
proxyholders, who are not required to be shareholders, to attend and act at
the meeting in the manner and to the extent authorized by the proxy and with
the authority conferred by the proxy.

A form of proxy shall be a written or printed form that complies with the
regulations under the Act (to the extent applicable). A form of proxy becomes
a proxy on completion by or on behalf of a shareholder and execution by the
shareholder or such shareholders attorney authorized in
writing. Alternatively, a proxy may be an electronic document that satisfies
the requirements of Part XX.1 of the Act. A proxy is valid only at the meeting
in respect of which it is given or at any adjournment thereof.

 



- 12 \- The directors may specify in a notice calling a meeting of shareholders a time
not exceeding 48 hours, excluding Saturdays and holidays, preceding the
meeting or an adjournment thereof before which time proxies to be used at the
meeting must be deposited with the Corporation or its agent (subject to the
rights of shareholders to revoke proxies, as provided below).

A shareholder may revoke a proxy either (i) by depositing an instrument in
writing executed by the shareholder or by the shareholders attorney
authorized in writing at the registered office of the Corporation at any time
up to and including the last business day preceding the day of the meeting, or
an adjournment thereof, at which the proxy is to be used, or with the chair
of the meeting on the day of the meeting or an adjournment thereof, or (ii) in
any other manner permitted by law.

 

Notwithstanding the establishment of time limits for the deposit or revocation
of proxies by shareholders pursuant to the foregoing, the chairman of any
meeting or the Chairman of the Board may, but need not, at his, her or their
sole discretion, waive the time limits for the deposit or revocation of
proxies by shareholders, including any deadline set out in the notice calling
the meeting of shareholders, or in any proxy circular. Any such waiver made
in good faith shall be final and conclusive.

41\. _Adjournment_

 

The chair of the meeting may adjourn any meeting of shareholders from time to
time to a fixed time and place. If the meeting is adjourned for less than 30
days, no notice of the time and place for the holding of the adjourned meeting
need be given to any shareholder, other than by announcement at the earliest
meeting that is adjourned. If a meeting of shareholders is adjourned by one
or more adjournments for an aggregate of 30 days or more, notice of the
adjourned meeting shall be given as for an original meeting but, unless the
meeting is adjourned by one or more adjournments for an aggregate of more than
90 days, subsection 149(1) of the Act does not apply. Any adjourned meeting
shall be duly constituted if held in accordance with the terms of the
adjournment and a quorum is present thereat. The persons who form the quorum
at the adjourned meeting need not be the same persons who formed the quorum
at the original meeting. If there is no quorum present at the adjourned
meeting, the original meeting shall be deemed to have terminated forthwith
after its adjournment. Any business may be brought before or dealt with at
any adjourned meeting which might have been brought before or dealt with at
the original meeting in accordance with the notice calling the same.

42.  _Quorum_

Two persons present and each holding or representing by proxy at least one
issued share of the Corporation shall be a quorum of any meeting of
shareholders for the choice of a chair of the meeting and for the adjournment
of the meeting to a fixed time and place but may not transact any other
business; for all other purposes a quorum for any meeting shall be persons
present not being less than two in number and holding or representing by proxy
shares to which are attached a majority of the votes attached to all the
issued shares of the Corporation enjoying voting rights at such meeting. If a
quorum is present at the opening of a meeting of shareholders, the
shareholders present may proceed with the business of the meeting,
notwithstanding that a quorum is not present throughout the meeting.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Corporation has only one shareholder, or
only one shareholder of any class or series of shares, the shareholder
present in person or by proxy constitutes a meeting and a quorum for such
meeting.

43\. _Rules and Regulations_

 

The directors shall be entitled to make such rules or regulations for the
conduct of meetings of shareholders of the Corporation as it shall deem
necessary, appropriate or convenient from time to time. Subject to such rules
and regulations, if any, the chairman of the meeting shall have the right and
authority to prescribe such rules,

 



- 13 \-  regulations and procedures and to do all acts as, in the judgment of such
chairman, are necessary, appropriate or convenient (and not inconsistent with
the articles of the Corporation or these bylaws) for the proper conduct of
the meeting, including, without limitation, establishing an agenda of business
of the meeting, recognizing shareholders entitled to speak, calling for the
necessary reports, stating questions and putting them to a vote, calling for
nominations, announcing the results of voting, establishing rules or
regulations to maintain order, imposing restrictions on entry to the meeting
after the time fixed for commencement thereof.

 

44\. _Resolutions in Writing_

 

Subject to subsection 142(1) of the Act,



     | (a) | a resolution in writing signed by all the shareholders
entitled to vote on that resolution at a meeting of shareholders is as valid
as if it had been passed at a meeting of the shareholders; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | a resolution in writing dealing with all matters required by
the Act to be dealt with at a meeting of shareholders, and signed by all the
shareholders entitled to vote at that meeting, satisfies all the requirements
of the Act relating to meetings of shareholders.

_SHARES AND TRANSFERS_

 

45\. _Issuance_

Subject to the articles of the Corporation, shares in the Corporation may be
issued at such time and issued to such persons and for such consideration as
the directors may determine.

 

46\. _Security Certificates_

Shares in the Corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that
the directors may determine by resolution that shares of some or all classes

form of transfer power on the reverse side thereof) shall (subject to
compliance with section 49 of the Act) be in such form as the directors may
from time to time by resolution approve and such certificates shall be signed
by a director or officer of the Corporation, or by a registrar, transfer
agent or branch transfer agent of the Corporation, or an individual on their
behalf, or by a trustee who certifies it in accordance with a trust indenture,
or the signature shall be printed or otherwise mechanically reproduced on the
certificate. If a security certificate contains a printed or mechanically
reproduced signature of a person, the Corporation may issue the security
certificate, notwithstanding that the person has ceased to be a director or an
officer of the Corporation, and the security certificate is as valid as if
the person were a director or an officer at the date of its issue.

47.  _Agent_

The directors may from time to time by resolution appoint or remove an agent
to maintain a central securities register and branch securities registers for
the Corporation.

48\. _Surrender of Security Certificates_

be recorded or registered unless and until either (i) the security
certificate representing the security to be transferred has been surrendered
and cancelled, or (ii) if no security certificate has been issued by the
Corporation in respect of such share, a duly executed security transfer power
in respect thereof has been presented for registration.

 



- 14 \- 49\. _Defaced, Destroyed, Stolen or Lost Security Certificates_

 

 __In case of the defacement, destruction, theft or loss of a security
certificate, the fact of such defacement, destruction, theft or loss shall be
reported by the owner to the Corporation or to a trustee, registrar, transfer
agent or other agent of the Corporation (if any) acting on behalf of the
Corporation, with a statement verified by oath or statutory declaration as to
the defacement, destruction, theft or loss and the circumstances concerning
the same and with a request for the issuance of a new security certificate to
replace the one so defaced, destroyed, stolen or lost. Upon the giving to the
Corporation (or, if there is such an agent, then to the Corporation and to
such agent) of an indemnity bond of a surety company in such form as is
approved by any authorized officer of the Corporation, indemnifying the
Corporation (and such agent, if any) against all loss, damage and expense,
which the Corporation and/or such agent may suffer or be liable for by reason
of the issuance of a new security certificate to such shareholder, and
provided the Corporation or such agent does not have notice that the security
has been acquired by a _bona fide_ purchaser, a new security certificate may
be issued in replacement of the one defaced, destroyed, stolen or lost, if
such issuance is ordered and authorized by any authorized officer of
the Corporation or by resolution of the directors. __

_DIVIDENDS_

 

50\. _Declaration and Payment of Dividends_

 

The directors may from time to time by resolution declare and the Corporation
may pay dividends on its issued shares, subject to the provisions (if any) of
the Corporations articles.

The directors shall not declare and the Corporation shall not pay a dividend
if there are reasonable grounds for believing that:



     | (a) | the Corporation is, or would after the payment be, unable to
pay its liabilities as they become due; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the realizable value of the Corporations assets would
thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and stated capital of
all classes. 
---|---|--- 
 

The Corporation may pay a dividend by issuing fully paid shares of the
Corporation and, subject to section 42 of the Act, the Corporation may pay a
dividend in money or property.

51\. _Joint Securityholders_

 

In case several persons are registered as the joint holders of any securities
of the Corporation, any one of such persons may give effectual receipts for
all dividends and payments on account of dividends, principal, interest and/or
redemption payments on redemption of securities (if any) subject to redemption
in respect of such securities.

 

 _RECORD DATES_

52.  _Shareholders  Meetings_

Subject to section 134 of the Act, the directors may fix in advance a date as

seven days before the date so fixed,

Corporation will permit the Unitholder to exercise such Statutory Right
directly, to the maximum extent possible, as if the Unitholder was the
registered owner of the shares of the Corporation receivable upon the exchange
of the Exchangeable Units owned of record by such Unitholder pursuant to the
LPA.

 

57\. _Termination of Statutory Rights_

 

All of the rights of a Unitholder with respect to the Statutory Rights shall

_PARTNERSHIP UNITS_

The interests in the Partnership of the Partners other than the limited
partnership interest of the Initial Limited Partner will be divided into and
represented, as of the date hereof, by an unlimited number of only each of
three classes of Units as follows: (i) interests of the General Partner will
be represented by Class A common partnership units ("Common Units") and
preferred partnership units ("Preferred Units"); and (ii) interests of Limited
Partners other than the limited partnership interest of the Initial Limited
Partner will be represented by Class B exchangeable limited partnership units
("Exchangeable Units"). Except in accordance with this Agreement, no other
Partnership Interests, Units or other interests in the Partnership shall be
issued other than as specified by the preceding sentence. Each of the Units
will represent an interest in the Partnership having the preferences, rights,
restrictions, conditions and limitations provided in this Agreement including:

 



     | (a) | the holders of Units will have the right to receive
allocations of net income, net loss, taxable income and tax loss as provided
in this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | the holders of the Units will have the right to share in
returns of capital and to share in cash and any other distributions to
Partners and to receive the remaining assets of the Partnership on dissolution
or winding up in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | the holders of Units will have the right to receive notice

respect of the Units held by each.

3.2 _Rights, Privileges, Restrictions and Conditions of Exchangeable Units_

In addition to the preferences, rights, restrictions, conditions and
limitations set out in Section 3.1, each Exchangeable Unit will have the
rights and preferences set out in Schedule A hereto.

3.3 _Common Unit Exchange Right_

 



     | (a) | A Partner holding Common Units shall, from time to time,
have the right to require the Partnership to exchange any or all of the Common
Units held by such Partner for Exchangeable Units on a one-for-one basis
(the "Common Exchange Right") for the purpose of effecting a sale or transfer
of Exchangeable Units as promptly as reasonably practicable after the exercise
of the Common Exchange Right. A Partner exercising the Common Exchange Right
may exercise such right contemporaneously with a transfer of the Partners
Partnership Interest as represented by the Common Units proposed to be
exchanged such that the transferee shall receive Exchangeable Units as a
result of such transfer. A Partner holding Common Units shall only exercise
the Common Exchange Right if the proceeds from the sale of the Exchangeable
Units received pursuant to the exercise of such Common Exchange Right are
promptly used to redeem a number of Holdings Shares equal to the number of
Common Units exchanged for such Exchangeable Units pursuant to such Common
Exchange Right. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | To exercise the Common Exchange Right, the holder of Common
Units shall present and surrender at the office of the Partnership a written
notice duly executed by the holder and, where applicable, the Certificate
or Certificates representing the Common Units which the holder desires to
have exchanged, together with such additional documents and instruments as the
General Partner or the Registrar and Transfer Agent may reasonably require.
Such notice shall:  
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | specify that the holder desires to have all or any number
specified therein of the Common Units (the "Subject Common Units") exchanged
by the Partnership; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | state the Business Day on which the holder desires to have
the Partnership exchange the Subject Common Units (the "Common Exchange
Date"); and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | where the Common Exchange Right is being exercised in
connection with a transfer of the Partnership Interest represented by the
Subject Common Units, information required by Section 3.15 in order to effect
the proposed transfer, including the name and address of the designated
transferee or transferees. The General Partner shall only transfer any of its
Partnership Interests (to the extent otherwise permitted herein), including
Common Units and Preferred Units, with the prior approval of the Conflicts
Committee. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Subject to compliance by the applicable holder of Common
Units with the terms of this Section 3.3, and provided that such request is
not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in Section 3.3(g),
the General Partner will exchange the Subject Common Units effective at the
close of business on the Common Exchange Date and will cause to be delivered
to such holder (or its transferee) the appropriate number of Exchangeable
Units. If only a part of the Common Units represented by any Certificate is
exchanged, a new Certificate for the balance of such Common Units will be
issued to the holder at the expense of the Partnership. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) |

The General Partner will deliver or cause the Registrar and Transfer Agent to
deliver the relevant holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the
Register of the Partnership for the Common Units or at the address specified
in the holders exchange request or by holding for pick-up by the holder at
the registered office of the Partnership or at any office of the Registrar and
Transfer Agent as may be specified by the General Partner by notice to the
holders of Common Units, Certificates representing Exchangeable Units
registered in the name of the holder or in such other name as the holder may
request. The delivery of such Certificates on behalf of the Partnership, or
by the Registrar and Transfer

- 14 \- discharge all liability with respect to the exchange of Common Units for
Exchangeable Units to the extent that the same is represented by such
Certificates. 
---|--- 



     | (e) | On and after the close of business on the Common Exchange
Date, the holder of the Subject Common Units will cease to be a holder of such
Subject Common Units and will not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of
a holder in respect thereof, other than the right to receive its
proportionate number of Exchangeable Units (or to require the transfer of such
Units to the designated transferee), unless delivery of the appropriate number
of Exchangeable Units to the holder (or its transferee) is not made as
provided in Section 3.3(c), in which case the rights of such holder will
remain unaffected until the appropriate number of Exchangeable Units has been
delivered to the holder (or its transferee) in the manner provided in this
Article. On and after the close of business on the Common Exchange Date,
provided that the presentation and surrender of Certificates has been made in
accordance with the foregoing provisions, the holder of the Subject
Common Units so exchanged (or such holders transferee, if applicable) will
thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be a holder of the
Exchangeable Units delivered to it. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) | Notwithstanding Section 3.3(e), where a record date in
respect of a dividend or distribution occurs prior to the Common Exchange Date
and there is a declared and unpaid dividend or distribution on any Common
Unit exchanged hereunder, such amount shall remain payable and shall be paid
in cash on the designated payment date to the former holder of the Common Unit
so exchanged hereunder. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (g) | A holder of Subject Common Units may, by notice in writing
given by the holder to the Partnership before the close of business on the
first Business Day immediately preceding the Common Exchange Date, withdraw a
notice given pursuant to section 3.3(b), in which event such notice shall be
null and void. 
---|---|--- 



     | (h) | If only a part of the Common Units represented by any
Certificate is exchanged, a new Certificate for the balance of such Common
Units shall be issued to the holder at the expense of the Partnership. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | All filing fees, transfer taxes, sales taxes, document
stamps or other similar changes levied by any Governmental Authority in
connection with the exchange of Common Units pursuant to this Agreement shall
be paid by the Partnership.

So long as any Exchangeable Units are outstanding:



     | (a) | The General Partner shall, and shall cause the Partnership

Agreement is in effect (i) each Exchangeable Unit has the same economic rights
as each Common Unit (for the avoidance of doubt, not taking into account
Section 5.4(f)), (ii) the number of Common Units outstanding equals the number
of Holdings Shares outstanding, subject to any adjustment that might be
required pursuant to Section 11.1; and (iii) the number of Preferred Units
outstanding equals the number of Preferred Shares of Holdings outstanding.

5.4(f) and such reimbursement proceeds shall be deemed to be contributed by
the General Partner to the Partnership) to the Partnership in exchange for a
number of newly issued Preferred Units equal to the number of Preferred Shares
issued; and

     | (iii) | if a new class of shares in the capital of Holdings is
created and issued by Holdings ("New Shares"), the General Partner shall
(either immediately before or after such issuance) (A) cause the Partnership
to create a corresponding new class of Units ("New Units") that has
corresponding economic rights to such New Shares, (B) cause the Partnership to
issue one New Unit for each New Share issued by Holdings in exchange for the
contribution by Holdings of the proceeds from the issuance of such New Shares
(net of any selling or underwriting discounts or commissions or other
expenses, which for the avoidance of doubt, shall be deemed to be reimbursed
by the Partnership in accordance with Section 5.4(f) and such reimbursement
proceeds shall be deemed to be contributed by the General Partner to the
Partnership) to the Partnership, and (C) effect such amendments to this
Agreement as are necessary in order to provide that the distributions and
allocations on the New Units to Holdings pursuant to this Agreement are made
on terms that allow Holdings to fund distributions on such New Shares in

that the capital of Holdings in the Partnership continues to correspond with
the outstanding capital of Holdings.

     | (c) | Upon the exchange of any Exchangeable Units for Exchanged
Shares pursuant to the exercise of an Exchange Right, as of the effective date
of such exchange, each Exchanged Share issued in exchange for an Exchangeable

Partnership in exchange for a new Common Unit and (ii) then immediately
thereafter to have been delivered by the Partnership to the holder exercising
the Exchange Right and the Exchangeable Unit shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist. Upon the exchange of any Exchangeable Units for the Cash
Amount (as defined in Schedule A) pursuant to the exercise of an Exchange
Right, as of the effective date of such exchange, each such Exchangeable Unit
automatically shall be deemed cancelled concomitant with such payment, without
any action on the part of any Person, including Holdings or the Partnership. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | If Holdings redeems, repurchases or otherwise acquires any
Holdings Shares for cash (including a redemption, repurchase or acquisition of
restricted Holdings Shares for nominal or no value), the Partnership

redeem or repurchase or acquire an identical number of Common Units held by
Holdings upon the same terms, including the same price, as the terms of the
redemption, repurchase or acquisition of the Holdings Shares. If Holdings
redeems, repurchases or otherwise acquires any Preferred Shares for cash, the
Partnership shall, immediately prior to such redemption, repurchase or
acquisition, redeem, repurchase or acquire an identical number of Preferred
Units held by Holdings upon the same terms, including the same price, as the
terms of the redemption, repurchase or acquisition of the Preferred Shares.
For the avoidance of doubt, redemptions, repurchases or other acquisitions of
Holdings Shares or Preferred Shares shall not be considered "distributions"
for the purposes of Section 5.4(a) of this Agreement and thus will not result
in any requirement for similar redemptions, repurchases or other acquisitions
of Exchangeable Units.

     | (e) |

If Holdings effects any Subdivision or Combination of Holdings Shares, the
General Partner shall cause the Partnership to simultaneously effect,

precluded from making any claim against the Partnership, the General Partner
or the Registrar and Transfer Agent for such transfer or for a new
Certificate.

promulgated thereunder. Any other item 

---|---|--- 
 



- 25 \- Account under Section 704(b) of the Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder or otherwise under this Agreement shall be so
reflected. The General Partner shall make such adjustments to Capital Accounts
as it determines in its sole discretion to be appropriate to ensure
allocations are made in accordance with a Partners interest in
the Partnership. Interest shall not be payable on Capital Account balances.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
General Partner shall maintain the Capital Accounts of the Partners in

of the Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

     | (d) | Notwithstanding anything expressed or implied to the
contrary in this Agreement, in the event the General Partner, with the prior
approval of the Conflicts Committee, shall determine, in its sole and
absolute discretion, that it is prudent to modify the manner in which the
Capital Accounts, or any debits or credits thereto, are computed in order to
give economic effect to the manner in which distributions are made to the
Partners pursuant to the provisions of Sections 5.4 and 13.3, the General
Partner may make such modification. 
---|---|--- 

ARTICLE 5

 

 _PARTICIPATION IN PROFITS AND LOSSES_

 

5.1 _Allocation of Net Income or Losses_

 

Net income or loss of the Partnership for accounting purposes will be
allocated to each Partner in the same proportion as income or loss
is allocated to the Capital Accounts of the Partners as provided in Section
5.2.

5.2 _Allocation for Capital Account Purposes_

 



     | (a) | After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in
Section 5.2(b), Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Fiscal Year or
other taxable period shall be allocated among the Capital Accounts of
the Partners in a manner that as closely as possible gives economic effect
the manner in which distributions are made to the Partners pursuant to the
provisions of Sections 5.4 (other than Section 5.4(f)) and 13.3. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | _Special Allocations_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Section 5.2, the following special allocations shall be made for each
Fiscal Year or other taxable period: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) |

_Partnership Minimum Gain Chargeback_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Section 5.2, if there is a net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain
during any Partnership taxable period, each Partner shall be allocated items
of Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent
periods) in the manner and amounts provided in U.S. Treasury Regulations  

---|---|--- 
 



- 26 \- or any successor provision. For purposes of this Section 4.1(d), each
Partners Adjusted Capital Account balance shall be determined, and the
allocation of income and gain required hereunder shall be effected, prior to
the application of any other allocations pursuant to this Section 5.2(b) with
respect to such taxable period (other than an allocation pursuant to Sections
5.2(b)(iii) and (vi). This Section 5.2(b)(i) is intended to comply with the
Partnership Minimum Gain chargeback requirement in U.S. Treasury Regulations
Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.  
---|--- 



     | (ii) | _Chargeback of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain_.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 5.2 (other than Section
5.2(b)(i)), except as provided in U.S. Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-2(i)(4), if there is a net decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum
Gain during any Partnership taxable period, any Partner with a share of
Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain at the beginning of such taxable period
shall be allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such period (and,
if necessary, subsequent periods) in the manner and amounts provided in U.S.
Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(ii), or any
successor provisions. For purposes of this Section 5.2(b), each Partners
Adjusted Capital Account balance shall be determined, and the allocation of
income and gain required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application
of any other allocations pursuant to this Section 5.2(b), other than Section
5.2(b)(i) and other than an allocation pursuant to Sections 5.2(b)(v) and
(vi), with respect to such taxable period. This Section 5.2(b)(ii) is intended
to comply with the chargeback of items of income and gain requirement in U.S.
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i) (4) and shall be interpreted
consistently therewith. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | _Qualified Income Offset_. In the event any Partner
unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations or distributions described
in U.S. Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5), or (6),
items of Partnership income and gain shall be specially allocated to such
Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent
required by the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of
the Code, the deficit balance, if any, in its Adjusted Capital Account
created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as quickly as
possible unless such deficit balance is otherwise eliminated pursuant to
Sections 5.2(b)(i) or (ii). This Section 5.2(b)(iii) is intended to qualify
and be construed as a "qualified income offset" within the meaning of U.S.
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted
consistently therewith. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iv) | _Gross Income Allocations_. In the event any Partner has a
deficit balance in its Capital Account at the end of any Partnership taxable
period in excess of the sum of (A) the amount such Partner is required
to restore pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and (B) the amount
such Partner is deemed obligated to restore pursuant to U.S. Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5), such Partner shall be
specially allocated items of Partnership gross income and gain in the amount
of such excess as quickly as possible; provided, that an allocation pursuant
to this Section 5.2(b)(iv) shall be made only if and to the extent that such
Partner would have a deficit balance in its Capital Account as adjusted after
all other allocations provided for in this Section 5.2 have been tentatively
made as if this Section 5.2(b)(iv) were not in this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (v) | _Nonrecourse Deductions_. Nonrecourse Deductions for any
taxable period shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with their
respective Percentage Interests. If the General Partner determines that
the Partnerships Nonrecourse Deductions should be allocated in a different
ratio to satisfy the safe harbor requirements of the U.S. Treasury Regulations
promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the General Partner is
authorized to revise the prescribed ratio to the numerically closest ratio
that does satisfy such requirements. 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) |

_Partner Nonrecourse Deductions_. Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any
taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the Partner that bears the Economic
Risk of Loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which such
Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with U.S.
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i). If more than one Partner bears the
Economic  

---|---|--- 
 



- 27 \- Partner Nonrecourse Deductions attributable thereto shall be allocated between
or among such Partners in accordance with the ratios in which they share such
Economic Risk of Loss. 
---|--- 



     | (vii) | _Nonrecourse Liabilities_. Nonrecourse Liabilities of the
Partnership described in U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3) shall
be allocated among the Partners in a manner chosen by the General Partner and
consistent with such Treasury Regulation. 
---|---|--- 



     | (viii) | _Code Section 754 Adjustments_. To the extent an
adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to
Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to U.S.
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account
in determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital
Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the
basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and
such item of gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in a
manner consistent with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required
to be adjusted pursuant to such Section of the U.S. Treasury Regulations. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ix) | _Curative Allocation_. 
---|---|--- 



     | (A) | The Required Allocations are intended to comply with certain
requirements of the U.S. Treasury Regulations. It is the intent of the
Partners that, to the extent possible, all Required Allocations shall be
offset either with other Required Allocations or with special allocations of
other items of Partnership income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to this
Section 5.2(b)(ix). Therefore, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Article 5 (other than the Required Allocations), the General Partner shall
make such offsetting special allocations of Partnership income, gain, loss or
deduction in whatever manner it determines appropriate so that, after such
offsetting allocations are made, each Partners Capital Account balance is,
to the extent possible, equal to the Capital Account balance such Partner
would have had if the Required Allocations were not part of this Agreement and
all Partnership items were allocated pursuant to the economic agreement among
the Partners. 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | The General Partner shall, with respect to each taxable
period, (1) apply the provisions of Section 5.2(b)(ix)(A) in whatever order is
most likely to minimize the economic distortions that might otherwise result
from the Required Allocations, and (2) divide all allocations pursuant to
Section 5.2(b)(ix)(A) among the Partners in a manner that is likely to
minimize such economic distortions. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (x) | _Partnership Recourse Liabilities_. Any guarantee of
Partnership debt by the General Partner shall not be taken into account for
purposes of Section 752 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder. 
---|---|--- 

5.3 _Allocation of Net Income and Losses for Tax Purposes_

 



     | (a) | Except as otherwise provided herein, each item of income,
gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, among the Partners in the same manner as its correlative item
of "book" income, gain, loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to Section
5.2(a). 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

In accordance with Section 704(c) of the Code and the U.S. Treasury
Regulations thereunder, income, gain, loss, and deduction with respect to
any Property contributed to the capital of the Partnership and with respect
to reverse Code Section 704(c) allocations described in U.S. Treasury
Regulations 1.704-3(a)(6) shall, solely for tax purposes, be allocated among
the Partners so as to take account of any variation between the adjusted basis
of such Property to the Partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and
its initial Carrying Value or its Carrying Value determined pursuant to
U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) (computed in
accordance with the definition of Carrying Value) using any allocation method
under U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3 as the General Partner may
decide. Any elections or other decisions relating to such allocations shall
be made by the General Partner in any manner that reasonably reflects the
purpose and intention of this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 
 



- 28 \- the Code (and the principles thereof), and U.S. Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(4)(i) are solely for purposes of federal, state, and local taxes
and shall not affect, or in any way be taken into account in computing, any
Partners Capital Account or share of Net Income, Net Loss, other items, or
distributions pursuant to any provision of this Agreement.  
---|--- 



     | (c) | The income for Canadian tax purposes of the Partnership for
a given Fiscal Year (or other taxable period) of the Partnership will be
allocated in the following order and proportions: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | to each holder of the Preferred Units in an amount equal to
the aggregate of: (A) the Preferred Return for all prior Fiscal Years (or
other taxable periods) except to the extent income for Canadian tax purposes
has been allocated in respect of the Preferred Return for the prior Fiscal
Years (or other taxable periods); and (B) the Preferred Return for the given
Fiscal Year (or other taxable period); 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | to each Partner in an amount calculated by multiplying: 
---|---|--- 



     | (A) | the aggregate income allocated to the Partners net of the
income allocated to the holders of the Preferred Units in paragraph (i) above
by 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (B) | a fraction, (1) the numerator of which is the sum of the
fair market value of all distributions received by that Partner with respect
to that Fiscal Year or other taxable period (other than distributions on
account of the Preferred Return), and (2) the denominator of which is the
aggregate fair market value of all distributions made to all Partners by the
Partnership with respect to that Fiscal Year or other taxable period net of
distributions on account of the Preferred Return. 
---|---|--- 

If, with respect to a given Fiscal Year or other taxable period, income of the
Partnership for Canadian tax purposes exceeds the amount allocated to the
holders of the Preferred Units in paragraph (i) above and no distribution is
made by the Partnership to its Partners (other than on account of the
Preferred Return), or the Partnership has a loss for Canadian tax purposes,
the General Partner shall allocate the income or loss of the Partnership in
the manner it considers appropriate in the circumstances. In so allocating the
net income or loss, the General Partner shall act reasonably and fairly,
taking into account the amount and timing of actual and anticipated
distributions to each of the Partners (including the General Partner), with a
view to ensuring that each Partner is allocated a portion of the Partnerships
net income that substantially corresponds to the income that is distributed
to that Partner, subject to priority allocation of the income of the
Partnership to the holders of the Preferred Units.

 



     | (d) | The General Partner shall determine all matters concerning
allocations for tax purposes not expressly provided for herein in its sole
discretion. For the proper administration of the Partnership and for the
preservation of uniformity of Units (or any portion or class or classes
thereof), the General Partner may (i) amend the provisions of this Agreement
as appropriate (x) to reflect the proposal or promulgation of U.S. Treasury
Regulations under Section 704(b) or Section 704(c) of the Code or (y)
otherwise to preserve or achieve uniformity of Units (or any portion or class
or classes thereof), and (ii) adopt and employ or modify such conventions and
methods as the General Partner determines in its sole discretion to be
appropriate for (A) the determination for U.S. federal income tax purposes of
items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit and the allocation of such
items among Partners and between transferors and transferees under this
Agreement and pursuant to the Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, (B) the determination of the identities and tax
classification of Partners, (C) the valuation of Partnership assets and the
determination of tax basis, (D) the allocation of asset values and tax basis,
and (E) the adoption and maintenance of accounting methods. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | For purposes of determining the items of Partnership income,
gain, loss, deduction, or credit allocable to any Partner for U.S. federal
income tax purposes with respect to any period, such items shall be determined
on a daily, monthly, quarterly or other basis, as determined by the General
Partner in its sole discretion, using any permissible method under Section 706
of the Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. 
---|---|--- 
 



- 29 \- under the provisions of this Article V shall instead be made to the beneficial
owner of Partnership Interests held by a nominee in any case in which the
nominee has furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in
accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method determined by
the General Partner in its sole discretion. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (g) | For Canadian Tax purposes, net income and loss of the
Partnership will be determined in accordance with the Tax Act. 
---|---|--- 
 

5.4 _Distributions_



     | (a) | Subject to Sections 5.4(c) and 5.4(f), the General Partner
shall cause distributions to be made by the Partnership to the Partners as
follows: (i) if a dividend or distribution shall have been declared and
be payable in respect of a Preferred Share, the Partnership shall make a
distribution in the same amount in respect of each [corresponding] Preferred
Unit, and (ii) if a dividend or distribution shall have been declared and be
payable in respect of a Holdings Share, the Partnership shall make a
distribution in the same amount in respect of each Exchangeable Unit and
Common Unit (and, for the avoidance of doubt, subject to Sections 5.4(a) and
5.4(f), all distributions made to the holders of Exchangeable Units and the
holders of Common Units shall be made pro rata in accordance with the
Partners respective Percentage Interests). 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
General Partner is authorized to take any action that may be required to cause
the Partnership or any of its Affiliates to comply with any
withholding requirements established under the Code (including pursuant to
Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446 and 3406), the Tax Act, or any other federal,
state, provincial, local or foreign law. To the extent that the Partnership is
required to or elects to withhold and pay over to any taxing authority any
amount resulting from the allocation or distribution of income to any Partner
(including by reason of Section 1446 of the Code) or to the extent that any
payments made to the Partnership are subject to withholding as a result of
such payments being attributable to any particular Partner, the General
Partner may treat the amount withheld as a distribution of cash to such
Partner pursuant to Sections 5.4 and 13.3 in the amount of such withholding
from or in respect of such Partner. The General Partner may treat taxes paid
by the Partnership on behalf of, or amounts previously withheld with respect
to, all or less than all of the Partners, as a distribution of cash to
such Partners. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a), in the event of the
dissolution of the Partnership, all receipts received during or after the
Fiscal Year quarter in which the Liquidation Date occurs shall be applied
and distributed solely in accordance with, and subject to the terms and
conditions of, Section 13.3. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Each distribution in respect of a Partnership Interest shall
be paid by the Partnership, directly or through the Registrar and Transfer
Agent or through any other Person or agent, only to the Record Holder of
such Partnership Interest as of the Record Date set for such distribution.
Such payment shall constitute full payment and satisfaction of the
Partnerships liability in respect of such payment, regardless of any claim of
any Person who may have an interest in such payment by reason of an
assignment or otherwise. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Partnership, and the General Partner on behalf of the
Partnership, shall not be required to make a distribution to a Partner or a
Record Holder if such distribution would violate the Act or other applicable
Law. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) |

Notwithstanding the provisions of 5.4(a), the General Partner, in its sole
discretion, may authorize that to the extent that the General
Partner determines that expenses or other obligations of Holdings are related
to its role as the General Partner or the business and affairs of Holdings
that are conducted through the Partnership or any of the Partnerships direct
or indirect Subsidiaries, cash (and, for the avoidance of doubt, only cash)
distributions may be made to Holdings (which distributions shall be made
without pro rata distributions to the other Partners) in amounts required for
Holdings to pay (v) any tax liabilities of Holdings, (w) any operating,
administrative and other similar costs incurred by 

---|---|--- 
 



- 30 \- equity securities of Holdings to the extent the proceeds are used or will be
used by Holdings to pay expenses or other obligations described in this
Section 5.4(f) (in either case only to the extent economically equivalent
indebtedness or equity securities of the Partnership were not issued to
Holdings) and payments pursuant to any legal, tax, accounting and
other professional fees and expenses, (x) any judgments, settlements,
penalties, fines or other costs and expenses in respect of any claims against,
or any litigation or proceedings involving, Holdings, (y) fees and expenses
(including any underwriters discounts and commissions) related to any
securities offering, investment or acquisition transaction (whether or not
successful) authorized by the board of directors of Holdings and (z) other
fees and expenses in connection with the maintenance of the existence of
Holdings (including any costs or expenses associated with being a public
company listed on a national securities exchange). For the avoidance of doubt,
distributions made under this 5.4(f) may not be used to pay or facilitate
dividends or distributions on the Holdings Shares and must be used solely for
one of the express purposes set forth pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence. All distributions under this Section 5.4(f) shall be treated
as "guaranteed payments" within the meaning of Section 707(c) of the Code. 
---|--- 

5.5 _Repayments_

 

If, as determined by the General Partner, it appears that any Partner has
received an amount under this Article 5 which is in excess of that Partners
entitlement, the Partner will, promptly upon notice from the General Partner,
reimburse the Partnership to the extent of the excess, and failing immediate
reimbursement, the General Partner may withhold the amount of the
excess (with interest at the rate of % from time to time calculated and
compounded monthly) from further distributions otherwise due to the Partner.

the General Partner may (with the prior approval of the Conflicts Committee)
determine, in its discretion. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Any Group Member (including the Partnership) may lend or
contribute to any other Group Member, and any Group Member may borrow from any
other Group Member (including the Partnership), funds on terms and
conditions determined by the General Partner. The foregoing authority shall
be exercised by the General Partner in its sole discretion and shall not
create any right or benefit in favour of any Group Member or any other Person. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | The General Partner may itself, or may enter into an
agreement with any of its Affiliates (with respect to any such Affiliate who
is not the General Partner or any Subsidiary of the General Partner, with
prior approval of the Conflicts Committee) to, render services to a Group
Member or to the Partnership in the discharge of its duties as general partner
of the Partnership. The provisions of Section 5.4(f) shall apply to the
rendering of services described in this Section 7.3(c).

or convey any property to, or purchase any property from, the Partnership,
directly or indirectly, pursuant to transactions that are fair and reasonable
to the Partnership; provided however that the requirements of this Section
7.3(e) conclusively shall be deemed to be satisfied and not a breach of any
duty hereunder or existing at law, in equity or otherwise as to (i) any
transaction approved by Special Approval, (ii) any transaction, the terms of
which are no less favorable to the Partnership than those generally being
provided to or available from unrelated third parties, or (iii) any
transaction that is fair and reasonable to the Partnership, taking
into account the totality of the relationships between the parties involved
(including other transactions that may be or have been particularly favorable
or advantageous to the Partnership). With respect to any contribution of
assets to the Partnership in exchange for Partnership Interests or options,
rights, warrants or appreciation rights relating to Partnership Interests, the
Conflicts Committee, in determining whether the appropriate Partnership
Interest or options, rights, warrants or appreciation rights relating to
Partnership Interests are being issued, may take into account, among other
things, the fair market value of the assets, the liquidated and contingent
liabilities assumed, the tax basis in the assets, the extent to which tax-
only allocations to the transferor will protect the existing partners of the
Partnership against a low tax basis, and such other factors as the Conflicts
Committee deems relevant under the circumstances.

information and data which it may obtain through or on behalf of the
Partnership, the disclosure of which may adversely affect the interests of
the Partnership or a Limited Partner.

Contribution made by a Limited Partner to the Partnership. Moreover,
notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, but subject to

shareholders, employees or agents are liable, responsible for or accountable
in damages or otherwise to the Partnership or a Limited Partner for an action
taken or failure to act on behalf of the Partnership within the scope of the
authority conferred on the General Partner by this Agreement or by Law unless
the act or omission was performed or omitted fraudulently or in bad faith or
constituted wilful or reckless disregard of the General Partners obligations
under this Agreement.

Partnership from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities
joint or several expenses (including, without limitation, legal fees and
expenses on a solicitor/client basis), judgments, fines, settlements and
other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or
proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in

available to an Indemnitee where the Indemnitee has been adjudged by a final
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction in Ontario that is no
longer appealable to have been in breach of, or negligent in the performance
of, its obligations under this Agreement. The termination of any action, suit
or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction will not create a
presumption that the Indemnitee acted in a manner contrary to that specified
above.

claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding upon receipt by the Partnership of
an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay that amount if it is
determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified as
authorized in this Section 7.7.

     | (c) | The indemnification provided by this Section 7.7 will be in
addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled under any
agreement, pursuant to any vote of the Partners, as a matter of Law

---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the General Partner, a Departing Partner or any of their

and as to action in any other capacity.

 



     | (d) | The Partnership may purchase and maintain (or reimburse the
General Partner or its Affiliates for the cost of) insurance, on behalf of
those Persons (other than the General Partner itself) as the General

competence will be conclusively presumed to have been done or omitted in good
faith and in accordance with that opinion.

power, authority or obligations under this Agreement, to act through any of
its duly authorized officers.

reasonably believed by the General Partner to be in, or not opposed to, the
best interests of the Partnership.

7.20  _Resolution of Conflict of Interests_



     | (a) | Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the General
Partner or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Partnership, any
Group Member or any Partner (other than the General Partner), on the other,
any resolution or course of action by the General Partner or its Affiliates in
respect of such conflict of interest shall be permitted and deemed approved by
all Partners, and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement, or any
agreement contemplated herein or therein, or of any duty hereunder or existing
at Law or otherwise, if the resolution or course of action in respect of such
conflict of interest is (i) approved by Special Approval, (ii) on terms no
less favorable to the Partnership than those generally being provided to or
available from unrelated third parties or (iii) fair and reasonable to the
Partnership, taking into account the totality of the relationships between
the parties involved (including other transactions that may be or have been
particularly favorable or advantageous to the Partnership). The General
Partner shall be authorized but not required in connection with its
resolution of such conflict of interest to seek Special Approval of such
resolution, and the General Partner may (if the conflict of interest involves
an Affiliate of the General Partner who is not the General Partner or any
Subsidiary of the General Partner, with the approval of the Conflicts
Committee) also adopt a resolution or course of action that has not received
Special Approval. Failure to seek Special Approval shall not be deemed to
indicate that a conflict of interest exists or that Special Approval could
not have been obtained. If Special Approval is not sought and the Board of
Directors of the General Partner (and, if the conflict of interest involves an
Affiliate of the General Partner who is not the General Partner or any
Subsidiary of the General Partner, the Conflicts Committee) determines that
the resolution or course of action taken with respect to a conflict of
interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in clauses (ii) or (iii)
above, then it shall be presumed that, in making its decision, the Board of
Directors (and, if applicable, the Conflicts Committee) acted in good faith,
and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any Limited Partner, the
Partnership or any other Person bound by this Agreement challenging such
approval, the Person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding shall have the
burden of overcoming such presumption. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or any duty otherwise existing at Law, and without
limitation of Section 7.3, the existence of the conflicts of interest
described in or contemplated by the [Arrangement Circular/S-4] are hereby
approved, and all such conflicts of interest are waived, by all Partners and
shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise applicable
provision of Law, but subject to Conflict Committee approval where
so provided, whenever in this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated
hereby or otherwise the General Partner, in its capacity as the general
partner of the Partnership, is permitted to or required to make a decision in
its "sole discretion" or "discretion" or that it deems "necessary or
appropriate" or "necessary or advisable" or under a grant of similar authority
or latitude, then the General Partner, or such Affiliates causing it to
do so, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, make such decision in
its sole discretion (regardless of whether there is a reference to "sole
discretion" or "discretion"), and shall be entitled to consider only such
interests and factors as it desires, including its own interests, and shall
have no duty or obligation (fiduciary or otherwise) to give any consideration
to any interest of or factors affecting the Partnership or the Partners, and
shall not be subject to any other or different standards imposed by this
Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby, under the Act or under any
other Law. Whenever in this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated
hereby or otherwise the General Partner is permitted to or required to make a
decision in its "good faith" then for purposes of this Agreement, the General
Partner, or any of its Affiliates that cause it to make any  

---|---|--- 
 



- 39 \- good faith if such Person or Persons subjectively believe(s) that the decision
made or not made is in the best interests of the Partnership. 
---|--- 



     | (c) | Whenever the General Partner makes a determination or takes
or declines to take any other action, or any of its Affiliates causes it to do
so, in its individual capacity as opposed to in its capacity as a
general partner of the Partnership, whether under this Agreement or any other
agreement contemplated hereby or otherwise, then the General Partner, or such
Affiliates causing it to do so, are entitled, to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, to make such determination or to take or decline to take such other
action free of any duty (including any fiduciary duty) or obligation
whatsoever to the Partnership, any Limited Partner, any Record Holder or any
other Person bound by this Agreement, and the General Partner, or such
Affiliates causing it to do so, shall not, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, be required to act pursuant to any other standard imposed by this
Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby or under the Act or
any other Law. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the General Partner and its Affiliates shall have no duty or obligation,
express or implied, to (i) sell or otherwise dispose of any asset of
the Partnership Group other than in the ordinary course of business or (ii)
permit any Group Member to use any facilities or assets of the General Partner
and its Affiliates, except as may be provided in contracts entered into from
time to time specifically dealing with such use. Any determination by the
General Partner or any of its Affiliates to enter into such contracts shall be
in its sole discretion. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, neither the General Partner nor any other
Indemnitee shall have any duties or liabilities, including fiduciary duties,
to the Partnership, any Limited Partner or any other Person bound by this
Agreement, and the provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they
restrict or otherwise modify or eliminate the duties and liabilities,
including fiduciary duties, of the General Partner or any other Indemnitee
otherwise existing at Law, are agreed by the Partners to replace such other
duties and liabilities of the General Partner or such other Indemnitee. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) | The Limited Partners, hereby authorize the General Partner,
on behalf of the Partnership as a partner or member of a Group Member, to
approve of actions by the general partner or managing member of such Group
Member similar to those actions permitted to be taken by the General Partner
pursuant to this Section 7.20. 
---|---|--- 



     | (g) | The Limited Partners expressly acknowledge that the General
Partner is under no obligation to consider the separate interests of the
Limited Partners (including, without limitation, the tax consequences to
Limited Partners) in deciding whether to cause the Partnership to take (or
decline to take) any actions, and that the General Partner shall not be liable
for monetary damages for losses sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits
not derived by Limited Partners in connection with such decisions.

however, that delivery of such tax information may be subject to delay as a

and any decision of the chairperson concerning the validity of a proxy will be
final. Proxies will be valid only at the meeting with respect to which they
were solicited, or any adjournment of the meeting, but in any event will
cease to be valid one year from their date. A proxy given on behalf of joint
holders must be executed by all of them and may be revoked by any of them, and
if more than one of several joint holders is present at a meeting and they do
not agree which of them is to exercise any vote to which they are jointly
entitled, they will, for the purposes of voting, be deemed not to be present.

---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Every question submitted to a meeting of Partners will be
decided by an Ordinary Resolution on a show of hands unless otherwise required
by this Agreement or a poll is demanded by a Partner, in which case a poll
will be taken. In the case of an equality of votes, the chairperson will not
have a casting vote and the resolution will be deemed to be defeated. The
chairperson will be entitled to vote in respect of any Units held by the
chairperson or for which the chairperson may be a proxyholder. On any vote at
a meeting of Partners, a declaration of the chairperson concerning the result
of the vote will be conclusive. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | On a poll, each Person present at the meeting will have one
vote for each Unit entitled to vote in respect of which the Person is shown on
the Record as a Partner at the record date and for each Unit in respect of
which the Person is the proxyholder. Each Partner present at the meeting and
entitled to vote at the meeting will have one vote on a show of hands. If
Units are held jointly by two or more persons and only one of them is present
or represented by proxy at a meeting of Unitholders, that Unitholder may, in
the absence of the other or others, vote with respect those Units, but if more
than one of them is present or represented by proxy, they will vote together
on the whole Units held jointly. Where this Agreement or applicable Law only
permits certain Units to be voted on a matter, only votes in respect of such
Units will be recognized.

voted against any resolution so passed.

approve or initiate the taking of, or take, any other action at any meeting
of Partners will not come into existence or be effective in any manner unless
and until, prior to the exercise of any right or the taking of any action, the
Partnership has received an opinion of counsel advising the Limited Partners
(at the expense of the Partnership) as to the effect that the

 



- 45 \-  exercise of those rights or the taking of those actions may have on the
limited liability of any Limited Partners other than those Limited Partners
who have initiated that action, each of whom expressly acknowledges that the
exercise of the right or the taking of the action may subject each of those

legislation in Canada.

and proceedings shown in them will be deemed to have been duly passed and
taken.

 _HOLDINGS SUCCESSORS_

11.1  _Certain Requirements in Respect of Combination, etc._

As long as any Exchangeable Units (other than those owned by Holdings or its
subsidiaries) are outstanding, Holdings shall not consummate any transaction
(whether by way of reconstruction, reorganization, consolidation, merger,
transfer, sale, lease or otherwise) whereby all or substantially all of its
undertaking, property and assets would become the property of any other
Person or, in the case of a merger, of the continuing corporation resulting
therefrom, unless:



     | (a) | such other Person or continuing corporation (the "Holdings
Successor") by operation of law, becomes, without more, bound by the terms and
provisions of this Agreement or, if not so bound, executes, prior to or
contemporaneously with the consummation of such transaction, an agreement
supplemental hereto and such other instruments (if any) as are reasonably
necessary or advisable to evidence the assumption by the Holdings Successor of
liability for all moneys payable and property deliverable hereunder and the
covenant of such Holdings Successor to pay or cause to be paid and deliver or
cause to be delivered the same and its agreement to observe and perform all
the covenants and obligations of Holdings under this Agreement; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | such transaction shall be upon such terms and conditions as
substantially to preserve and not to impair in any material respect any of the
rights, duties, powers and authorities of the other parties hereunder.  
---|---|--- 

For the avoidance of doubt, if a transaction described in this Section 11.1
results in holders of Exchangeable Units being entitled to exchange their
Exchangeable Units for shares of a Holdings Successor in a different ratio
than that set out herein, then this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to
refer to such different ratio(s).

 

11.2 _Vesting of Powers in Successor_

 

Whenever the conditions of Section 11.1 have been duly observed and performed,
the parties, if required by Section 11.1, shall execute and deliver the
supplemental agreement provided for in Section 11.1(a) and thereupon the
Holdings Successor shall possess and from time to time may exercise each and
every right and power of Holdings under this Agreement in the name
of Holdings or otherwise and any act or proceeding by any provision of this
Agreement required to be done or performed by the Holdings Board of Directors
or any officers of Holdings may be done and performed with like force and
effect by the directors or officers of such Holdings Successor.

 



- 46 \- 11.3 _Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries_

 

Nothing herein shall be construed as preventing the amalgamation or merger of
any wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary of Holdings with or into
Holdings or the winding-up, liquidation or dissolution of any wholly-owned
direct or indirect subsidiary of Holdings (other than the Partnership)
provided that all of the assets of such subsidiary are transferred to Holdings

transactions are expressly permitted by this Article 11.

duly executed Exchange Notice and, where applicable, the certificate or
certificates representing the Exchangeable Units which the holder desires to

Notice shall (i) specify the number of Exchangeable Units in respect of which
the holder is exercising the Exchange Right (the "Subject Units") and (ii)
state the Business Day on which the holder desires to have the Partnership
exchange the Subject Units (the "Exchange Date"), provided that the Exchange

such Business Day is specified by the holder in the Exchange Notice, the
Exchange Date shall be deemed to be the 15th Business Day after the date on
which the Exchange Notice is received by the Partnership. 
---|--- 
 

3.2 _Share Settlement Option_

If the General Partner elects to repurchase the Subject Units for Holdings

the manner specified in Section 3.5 of this Schedule A, effective at the close
of business on the Exchange Date:



     | (a) | the Partnership shall have, and shall be deemed to have,

deemed to have transferred to the Partnership all of such holders right,

     | (b) | the Partnership shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to
such holder the applicable Cash Amount. 
---|---|---

Subject Units with the terms of this Schedule A, the Partnership (or Holdings
for and on behalf of the Partnership) shall deliver or cause the Transfer
Agent to deliver to the relevant holder, as applicable (i) the applicable
Exchanged Shares (which shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-
assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance), or
(ii) a cheque representing the applicable Cash Amount, in each case, less any
amounts withheld on account of tax pursuant to Section 5.4 of the Agreement,
and such delivery by or on behalf of the Partnership or by the Transfer Agent
shall be deemed to be payment of and shall satisfy and discharge all
liability for the total consideration payable or issuable. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | On and after the close of business on the Exchange Date, the
holders of the Subject Units shall cease to be holders of such Subject Units
and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a holder in
respect thereof, other than the right to receive the applicable consideration
unless payment of the consideration is not made in accordance with the
provisions of this Article 3. On and after the close of business on the

payment of the applicable consideration has been made in accordance with the
foregoing provisions, the holder of the Subject Units exchanged for Holdings
Shares shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be a
holder of the Holdings Shares delivered to it.

the office of the Partnership (or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may
be specified by the Partnership) of such documents and instruments as the
Transfer Agent and the Partnership may reasonably require. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Notwithstanding Section 3.4(b) of this Schedule A, where a
record date in respect of a dividend or distribution occurs prior to the
Exchange Date and there is any declared and unpaid dividend or distribution on
any Exchangeable Unit exchanged hereunder, subject to Section 6.2 of this
Schedule A, such amount shall remain payable and shall be paid in the
applicable form on the designated payment date to the former holder of the
Exchangeable Unit so exchanged hereunder. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | If only a part of the Exchangeable Units represented by any
certificate is exchanged, a new certificate for the balance of such
Exchangeable Units shall be issued to the holder at the expense of the
Partnership.  
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | All filing fees, transfer taxes, sales taxes, document
stamps or other similar changes levied by any Governmental Authority in
connection with the repurchase of the Exchangeable Units pursuant to this
Agreement shall be paid by the Partnership; provided, however, that the
holder of such Exchangeable Units shall pay any such fees, taxes, stamps or
similar charges that may be payable as a result of any transfer of the
consideration payable in respect of such Exchangeable Units to a Person other
than such holder. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each party
will bear its own costs in connection with the performance of its obligations
under this Agreement.

Combination or Subdivision of, or unit distribution on, the Exchangeable
Units, or any issue or distribution of rights to acquire Exchangeable Units or
securities exchangeable for or convertible into Exchangeable Units following
the Merger Effective Time); 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | a Holdings Control Transaction occurs, in which case,
provided that the General Partner determines, in good faith and in its sole
discretion, that such Holdings Control Transaction involves a _bona fide_

determination by the General Partner to be made at the direction of the
Conflicts Committee in circumstances where the third party in the transaction
is an Affiliate of the General Partner or the Partnership); or 
---|---|---

(a) From and after the one year anniversary of the date of the Merger

the right to require the Partnership to repurchase (the "Exchange Right") any
or all of the Exchangeable Units held by such holder for either (i) the
Exchanged Shares or (ii) the Cash Amount, the form of consideration to be
determined by the General Partner for and on behalf of the Partnership (in the

determination of the form of consideration shall be given to the holder of
the Exchangeable Units exercising the Exchange Right no later than 10 Business
Days prior to the Exchange Date.

 

(b) To exercise the Exchange Right, the holder shall present and surrender at
the office of the Partnership (or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may
be specified by the Partnership by notice to the holders of Exchangeable
Units) a duly executed Exchange Notice and, where applicable, the certificate
or certificates representing the Exchangeable Units which the holder
desires to have exchanged, together with such additional documents and
instruments as the Transfer Agent and the Partnership may reasonably require.
The Exchange Notice shall (i) specify the number of Exchangeable Units in
respect of which the holder is exercising the Exchange Right (the "Subject
Units") and (ii) state the Business Day on which the holder desires to have
the Partnership exchange the Subject Units (the "Exchange Date"), provided
that the Exchange Date shall be not

 



- 2 \-  less than 15 Business Days nor more than 30 Business Days after the date on
which the Exchange Notice is received by the Partnership and further provided
that, in the event that no such Business Day is specified by the holder in
the Exchange Notice, the Exchange Date shall be deemed to be the 15th Business
Day after the date on which the Exchange Notice is received by the
Partnership.

 

3.2 _Share Settlement Option_

If the General Partner elects to repurchase the Subject Units for Holdings
Shares, and provided that the Exchange Notice is not revoked by the holder in
the manner specified in Section 3.5 of this Schedule A, effective at the close
of business on the Exchange Date:



     | (a) | the Partnership shall have, and shall be deemed to have,

the terms of this Schedule A, the Partnership (or Holdings for and on behalf
of the Partnership) shall deliver or cause the Transfer Agent to deliver to
the relevant holder, as applicable (i) the applicable Exchanged Shares (which
shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be
free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance), or (ii) a cheque
representing the applicable Cash Amount, in each case, less any amounts
withheld on account of tax pursuant to Section 5.4 of the Agreement, and such
delivery by or on behalf of the Partnership or by the Transfer Agent shall be
deemed to be payment of and shall satisfy and discharge all liability for the
total consideration payable or issuable.

 

(b) On and after the close of business on the Exchange Date, the holders of
the Subject Units shall cease to be holders of such Subject Units and shall
not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a holder in respect thereof,
other than the right to receive the applicable consideration unless payment of
the consideration is not made in accordance with the provisions of this
Article 3. On and after the close of business on the Exchange Date, provided
that presentation and surrender of certificates and payment of the applicable
consideration has been made in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the
holder of the Subject Units exchanged for Holdings Shares shall thereafter be

Partnership) of such documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent and the
Partnership may reasonably require. 

(d) Notwithstanding Section 3.4(b) of this Schedule A, where a record date in
respect of a dividend or distribution occurs prior to the Exchange Date and
there is any declared and unpaid dividend or distribution on any Exchangeable
Unit exchanged hereunder, subject to Section 6.2 of this Schedule A, such
amount shall remain payable and shall be paid in the applicable form on the
designated payment date to the former holder of the Exchangeable Unit so
exchanged hereunder.

(e) If only a part of the Exchangeable Units represented by any certificate
is exchanged, a new certificate for the balance of such Exchangeable Units
shall be issued to the holder at the expense of the Partnership.

 

(f) All filing fees, transfer taxes, sales taxes, document stamps or other
similar changes levied by any Governmental Authority in connection with the
repurchase of the Exchangeable Units pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid
by the Partnership; provided, however, that the holder of such Exchangeable
Units shall pay any such fees, taxes, stamps or similar charges that may be
payable as a result of any transfer of the consideration payable in respect
of such Exchangeable Units to a Person other than such holder. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, each party will bear its own costs in

Units, or any issue or distribution of rights to acquire Exchangeable Units or
securities exchangeable for or convertible into Exchangeable Units following
the Merger Effective Time); 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | a Holdings Control Transaction occurs, in which case,
provided that the General Partner determines, in good faith and in its sole
discretion, that such Holdings Control Transaction involves a bona fide third
party and is not for the primary purpose of causing the exchange of the
Exchangeable Units in connection with such Holdings Control Transaction (such
determination by the General Partner to be made at the direction of the
Conflicts Committee in circumstances where the third party in the transaction
is an Affiliate of the General Partner or the Partnership); or

holders of the Exchangeable Units fail to take the necessary action at a
meeting or other vote of holders of Exchangeable Units to approve or
disapprove, as applicable, the Exempt Exchangeable Voting Event in order to
maintain economic equivalence of the Exchangeable Units and the Common Units, 
---|---|--- 
 

then on prior written notice given by the Partnership to the holders of
Exchangeable Units at least fifteen days prior to such mandatory exchange, in
the case of the foregoing Sections 3.6(a)(i) and 3.6(a)(ii), and on the
Business Day following the day on which the holders of the Exchangeable Units
failed to take such action in the case of the foregoing Sections 3.6(a)(iii)

Subject Units), on such date as is specified by the Partnership in such notice
(which shall be deemed to be the Exchange Date), pursuant to Section 3.2 of
this Schedule A, and for greater certainty the holders of Exchangeable Units
shall not have the right to revoke such mandatory exchange pursuant to Section
3.5 of this Schedule A.
