on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting or during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the Corporation.&nbsp;In
the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation. The stock ledger shall be

of director nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected at the meeting) shall be elected to the Board by the vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to such director nominee&#146;s election. In any contested election of
directors (i.e., an election in which the number of director nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected at the meeting), directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. For purposes of this section, &#147;a majority of votes
cast&#148; means that the number of shares voted &#147;for&#148; a director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast &#147;against&#148; that director nominee&#146;s election. &#147;Abstentions&#148; and &#147;broker non-votes&#148; shall not be
counted as votes cast with respect to a director nominee&#146;s election. Following certification of the stockholder vote in an uncontested election, any incumbent director who did not receive a majority of votes cast for his or her election shall
promptly tender his or her resignation, contingent upon acceptance of such resignation by the Board in accordance with this Section 1.08(b), to the Chairman of the Board. The Chairman of the Board shall inform the Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee of such tender of resignation, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall consider such resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept the tendered resignation or reject it or whether any other action should be
taken. In deciding upon its recommendation, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall consider all relevant factors, including without limitation the qualifications of the director who has tendered his or her resignation and the
director&#146;s contribution to the Corporation and the Board. The Board will act on the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee no later than 90 days after the certification of the stockholder vote and disclose the
decision by filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Board shall consider the factors considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and such additional information and factors that the
Board deems relevant. An incumbent director who tenders his or her resignation to the Board pursuant to this Section 1.08(b) will not participate in the decision of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or the Board. The stockholders do
not have the right to cumulate their votes for the election of directors. </P>
