Amethyst to be changed to "Envision Healthcare Corporation" as of the Merger
2 Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, from and after the Merger 2
Effective Time, all references herein to "New Amethyst" shall include New

Amethyst shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate to cause (a) the
ticker symbol of the New Amethyst Common Stock to be listed on the NYSE to be
"EVHC" and (b) the ticker symbol of the New Amethyst Series A-1 Preferred
Stock to be listed on the NYSE to be "EVHCPR", in each case as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Merger 2 Effective Time.

 

ARTICLE 2

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGERS

2.1 _Effects of the Mergers on Holdings and AmSurg Capital Stock_.

 



7 (a) _Effects of Merger 1 on AmSurg Capital Stock_. At the Merger 1 Effective
Time, by virtue of Merger 1 and without any action on the part of AmSurg or
New Amethyst, or any holder of any shares of AmSurg Common Stock, AmSurg
Preferred Stock, New Amethyst Common Stock or New Amethyst Preferred Stock:

 

(i) All shares of AmSurg Common Stock that are owned by New Amethyst or any
Subsidiary of New Amethyst prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time and all
shares of AmSurg Preferred Stock that are owned by New Amethyst or any
Subsidiary of New Amethyst immediately prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(ii) Subject to _Section 2.1(a)(i)_ and  _Section 2.3_, each share of
AmSurg Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger 1
Effective Time shall be automatically converted into and thereafter shall
represent one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of New Amethyst (" _New Amethyst Common
Stock_ ").

 

(iii) Subject to _Section 2.1(a)(i)_, each share of AmSurg Series
A-1 Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger 1
Effective Time shall be automatically converted into and thereafter shall
represent one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of 5.250%
Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A-1, par value $0.01 per share,
of New Amethyst (the " _New Amethyst Series A-1 Preferred Stock_"), with the
terms of the New Amethyst Series A-1 Preferred Stock set forth in the Amended
and Restated New Amethyst Charter.

 

(b) _Effects of Merger 2 on Holdings Capital Stock_. At the Merger 2
Effective Time, by virtue of Merger 2 and without any action on the part of
Holdings or New Amethyst, or any holder of any shares of Holdings Common
Stock, New Amethyst Common Stock or New Amethyst Preferred Stock:

 

(i) All shares of Holdings Common Stock that are owned by New Amethyst or any
Subsidiary of New Amethyst or that are held in the treasury of Holdings
immediately prior to the Merger 2 Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding
and shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(ii) Subject to _Section 2.1(b)(i)_, _Section 2.1(c)_ and _Section 2.3_,
each share of Holdings Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Merger 2 Effective Time shall be automatically converted into and
thereafter represent the right to receive that number of validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable shares of New Amethyst Common Stock equal to the
Exchange Ratio (the " _Merger 2 Consideration_ "). For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Exchange Ratio_ " means 0.334.

 



8 (iii) All such shares of Holdings Common Stock shall be converted into shares
of New Amethyst Common Stock pursuant to this _Section 2.1(b)_ and shall be
cancelled and cease to be outstanding and shall cease to exist and, as of the
Merger 2 Effective Time, each holder of a certificate representing any such
shares of Holdings Common Stock (a " _Holdings Certificate_ ") or shares of
Holdings Common Stock held in book entry form (" _Holdings Book-Entry Shares_
") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive, in accordance with this _Section 2.1(b)_, the Merger 2
Consideration and, if applicable, the Fractional Shares Cash Amount, upon
surrender of such Holdings Certificate or Holdings Book-Entry Share in
accordance with  _Section 2.2_.

(c) _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the Merger 2 Effective
Time, the outstanding shares of Holdings Common Stock, AmSurg Common Stock or
New Amethyst Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock
dividend or stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date
within said period, the Merger 2 Consideration and the Exchange Ratio and any
other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be equitably
adjusted to provide the holders of Holdings Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

(d) _Fractional Shares_.

 

(i) No fractional shares of New Amethyst Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with Merger 2, but in lieu thereof each holder of Holdings Common
Stock that would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of New
Amethyst Common Stock will instead be entitled to receive, from the Exchange
Agent in accordance with the provisions of this  _Section 2.1(d)_, a cash
payment in lieu of such fractional share of New Amethyst Common Stock
representing such holders proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds
from the sale by the Exchange Agent following the Merger 2 Effective Time
(reduced by any fees of the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) in one
or more transactions of an aggregate number of shares of New Amethyst Common
Stock equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate number of shares of
New Amethyst Common Stock to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by New
Amethyst pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_ over (B) the aggregate number of whole
shares of New Amethyst Common Stock to be distributed to the holders of shares
of Holdings Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_ (such excess, the "
_Excess Shares_ ").

 



9  AmSurg, New Amethyst and Holdings acknowledge that payment of the cash
consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of New Amethyst Common
Stock was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a
mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience
to New Amethyst that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional
shares of New Amethyst Common Stock in Merger 2. As soon as practicable after
the Merger 2 Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of
Holdings Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional shares of New
Amethyst Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices
on the NYSE in the manner provided in the following _Section 2.1(d)(ii)_.

(ii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, as agent for the
holders of Holdings Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional
shares of New Amethyst Common Stock, shall be executed on the NYSE. Until the
proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of
Holdings Common Stock entitled thereto, the Exchange Agent shall hold such
proceeds in trust for the holders of Holdings Common Stock that would
otherwise receive fractional shares of New Amethyst Common Stock (the "
_Common Shares Trust_ "). The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of
the Common Shares Trust to which each holder of Holdings Common Stock shall be
entitled, if any, by multiplying (x) the amount of the aggregate
proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by (y) a fraction, the numerator
of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder
of Holdings Common Stock would otherwise be entitled and the denominator of
which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all
holders of Holdings Common Stock would otherwise be entitled (the "
_Fractional Shares Cash Amount_ ").

 

(iii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of Holdings Common Stock in lieu of any fractional
shares of New Amethyst Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available
such amounts to such holders of shares of Holdings Common Stock without
interest, subject to and in accordance with _Section 2.2_. 

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry_.

 

(a) Prior to the dissemination of the Joint Proxy Statement to the
shareholders of AmSurg and the stockholders of Holdings, AmSurg and
Holdings shall mutually appoint a nationally recognized financial institution
to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") and AmSurg, New Amethyst
and Holdings shall enter into an agreement with the Exchange Agent providing
for, among other things and in each case in accordance with this _Article 2_
, the delivery, following the Merger 2 Effective Time, to the holders of
Holdings Common Stock of the shares of New Amethyst Common Stock into which
such holders shares were converted pursuant to Merger 2 and the Fractional
Shares Cash Amount, if applicable.

 



10 (b) At or prior to the Merger 2 Effective Time, New Amethyst shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Holdings
Common Stock entitled to receive shares of New Amethyst Common Stock in Merger
2 and for exchange in accordance with this _Article 2_ , (i) a number of
shares of New Amethyst Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_
upon conversion of the outstanding shares of Holdings Common Stock and (ii)
cash sufficient to make payments of any dividends or other distributions
declared or made prior to the Merger 2 Effective Time with a record date
after the Merger 2 Effective Time to such holders (together with the
Fractional Shares Cash Amount, the " _Holdings Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange
Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver such whole shares
of New Amethyst Common Stock contemplated to be issued pursuant to _Section
2.1(b)_ and the Fractional Shares Cash Amount out of the Holdings Exchange
Fund in accordance with the exchange procedures set forth in  _Section
2.2(e)_. The Holdings Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(c) All shares of New Amethyst Common Stock issued in respect of shares of
Holdings Common Stock (including any cash paid pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_)
shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of any rights
pertaining to such shares of Holdings Common Stock. 

(d) The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of
ownership with respect to the New Amethyst Common Stock held by it from time
to time hereunder.

(e) As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date (but in no event later
than three (3) Business Days thereafter), New Amethyst shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Holdings Certificate or
Holdings Book-Entry Share, in each case which shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger 2 Consideration at the Merger 2 Effective Time
pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Holdings
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Holdings
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and
have such other provisions as Holdings, AmSurg, New Amethyst and the Exchange
Agent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Holdings Certificates or Holdings Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, in exchange for the Merger 2 Consideration, and, if applicable,
the method of payment of such holders Fractional Shares Cash Amount. Upon
surrender of Holdings Certificates and Holdings Book-Entry

 



11  Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by AmSurg and Holdings, and upon delivery of a
letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form with all required
enclosures and attachments, with respect to such Holdings Certificates or
Holdings Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Holdings Certificates or
Holdings Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive the number of whole
shares of New Amethyst Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and this _Section 2.2_ and, if applicable, the
Fractional Shares Cash Amount. Any Holdings Certificates and Holdings Book-
Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the
Merger 2 Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name any surrendered Holdings Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition precedent to payment that the Holdings Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
similar Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger 2
Consideration, as applicable, to a Person other than the registered holder of
the Holdings Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the
satisfaction of Holdings that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
required to be paid. Delivery of the Merger 2 Consideration with respect to
Holdings Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such
Holdings Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated
hereby, each Holdings Certificate or Holdings Book-Entry Share shall be deemed
at any time after the Merger 2 Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger 2 Consideration and, if applicable, the Fractional
Shares Cash Amount as provided in this Agreement.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, AmSurg and New Amethyst agree that the
Exchange Agent shall not mail to each holder of record of any AmSurg Common
Certificate or AmSurg Preferred Certificate a letter of transmittal or
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of any such AmSurg Common
Certificate or AmSurg Preferred Certificate, as applicable, or affidavits of
loss in exchange for certificates representing shares of New Amethyst Common
Stock or New Amethyst Series A-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable, but instead
shall mail to each holder of record of any AmSurg Common Certificate or
AmSurg Preferred Certificate a letter explaining the conversion of such
holders shares as set forth in _Section 2.1(a)_. Holders of AmSurg Common
Stock and AmSurg Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to deliver their AmSurg Common Certificates or AmSurg Preferred
Certificates, as applicable, or affidavits of loss to the Exchange Agent
within six (6) months of the Merger 1 Effective Time and request a new
certificate representing their shares of New Amethyst Common Stock or New
Amethyst Series A-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable.

(g) _AmSurg Transfer Books_. At the Merger 1 Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of AmSurg shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of AmSurg Common Stock or AmSurg
Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Merger 1
Effective Time on the records of

 



12  AmSurg. From and after the Merger 1 Effective Time, the holders of AmSurg
Common Certificates and AmSurg Common Book-Entry Shares representing shares of
AmSurg Common Stock and the holders of AmSurg Preferred Certificates and
AmSurg Preferred Book-Entry Shares representing shares of AmSurg Series A-1
Preferred Stock, in each case outstanding immediately prior to the Merger 1
Effective Time, shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.

(h)  _Holdings Transfer Books_. At the Merger 2 Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of Holdings shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Holdings Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger 2 Effective Time on the records
of Holdings. From and after the Merger 2 Effective Time, the holders of
Holdings Certificates and Holdings Book-Entry Shares representing shares of
Holdings Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger 2 Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Merger 2
Effective Time, Holdings Certificates representing shares of Holdings Common
Stock are presented to New Amethyst for any reason, such Holdings Certificates
shall be cancelled and exchanged for a number of shares of New Amethyst Common
Stock equal to the number of such shares of Holdings Common Stock multiplied
by the Exchange Ratio and, if applicable, the Fractional Shares Cash Amount as
provided in this Agreement.

(i)  _Termination of Funds; Abandoned Property_. At any time following six
months after the Closing Date, New Amethyst shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to it any shares of New Amethyst Common Stock or
cash remaining in the Holdings Exchange Fund and made available to the
Exchange Agent and not delivered to holders of Holdings Certificates or
Holdings Book-Entry Shares and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to
look only to New Amethyst (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger 2
Consideration and, if applicable, the Fractional Shares Cash Amount payable
upon due surrender of such holders Holdings Certificates or Holdings Book-
Entry Shares, if any, and compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.2_.
If, prior to six years after the Closing Date (or otherwise immediately prior
to such time on which any payment in respect hereof would escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), any holder of Holdings
Certificates or Holdings Book-Entry Shares has not complied with the
procedures in this  _Section 2.2_ to receive the Merger 2 Consideration and,
if applicable, the Fractional Shares Cash Amount to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Merger 2 Consideration and, if applicable, the
Fractional Shares Cash Amount to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled in respect of such Holdings Certificates or Holdings Book-Entry
Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of New Amethyst, free and clear of all claims or 

 



13  interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Holdings, AmSurg, New Amethyst or the Exchange Agent, or
any Representative or affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any holder of a
Holdings Certificate or Holdings Book-Entry Share for the Merger 2
Consideration or, if applicable, the Fractional Shares Cash Amount delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

(j) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Holdings
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Holdings
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, the Merger 2 Consideration and, if applicable, the Fractional Shares
Cash Amount payable in respect thereof pursuant to this _Article 2_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that New Amethyst or the Exchange Agent may, in its
reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of
the Merger 2 Consideration and, if applicable, the Fractional Shares Cash
Amount, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Holdings
Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as New Amethyst or the Exchange
Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against New Amethyst or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Holdings
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

(k) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged New Amethyst Common Stock_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Merger 2
Effective Time with respect to New Amethyst Common Stock with a record date
after the Merger 2 Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Holdings Certificate or Holdings Book-Entry Share with respect
to the shares of New Amethyst Common Stock such holder is entitled to receive
upon surrender of such Holdings Certificate or Holdings Book-Entry Share and,
if applicable, no portion of the Fractional Shares Cash Amount shall be paid
to any such holder pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_, unless and until the holder
of such Holdings Certificate or Holdings Book-Entry Share shall surrender such
Holdings Certificate or Holdings Book-Entry Share. Subject to the effect of
escheat, abandoned property, Tax or other applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such Holdings Certificate or Holdings Book-Entry Share, there
shall be paid by New Amethyst to the holder of the certificates representing
whole shares of New Amethyst Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) promptly, the portion of the Fractional Shares Cash
Amount, if applicable, payable with respect to a fractional share of New
Amethyst Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section
2.1(d)_ and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Merger 2 Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole
shares of New Amethyst Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the
Merger 2 Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring
after surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of New Amethyst
Common Stock.

 



14 2.3 _Treatment of Holdings and AmSurg Stock Options and Stock-Based Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of AmSurg Stock Options and Stock-Based Awards in Merger 1_. As
of the Merger 1 Effective Time, each AmSurg Stock Option, AmSurg Stock Unit
Award and AmSurg PSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
1 Effective Time, whether or not then vested, shall be assumed by New Amethyst
and shall be converted at the Merger 1 Effective Time into an award covering
a number of shares of New Amethyst Common Stock that is the same as the number
of shares of AmSurg Common Stock that, immediately prior to the Merger 1
Effective Time, were covered by the award so assumed and replaced, and
otherwise having the same terms and conditions (including, as to any such
award that is a stock option, the same exercise price) as applied thereto
immediately prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time, but giving effect to the
Transactions. In addition, following the conversion of the AmSurg Restricted
Stock as provided in _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_, the resulting award shall cover a
number of shares of New Amethyst Common Stock that is the same as the number
of shares of AmSurg Common Stock that, immediately prior to the Merger 1
Effective Time, were covered by the award so converted, and otherwise having
the same terms and conditions as applied thereto immediately prior to the
Merger 1 Effective Time, but giving effect to the Transactions. Together with
the awards resulting from the conversion of the AmSurg Restricted Stock
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_, the awards resulting from the assumption
and conversion described in this _Section 2.3(a)_ are referred to herein as
the " _New Amethyst Awards_."

(b) _Treatment of Holdings Stock Options in Merger 2_. As of the Merger
2 Effective Time, each Holdings Stock Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Merger 2 Effective Time, whether or not
then vested or exercisable, shall automatically and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof be assumed by New Amethyst and shall be converted
into an option (an " _Assumed New Amethyst Stock Option_ ") to acquire shares
of New Amethyst Common Stock in accordance with this _Section 2.3(b)_. Each
such Assumed New Amethyst Stock Option as so assumed and converted shall
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as
applied to the Holdings Stock Option immediately prior to the Merger 2
Effective Time (but taking into account any changes thereto provided for in
this Agreement and by reason of the Transactions). As of the Merger 2
Effective Time, each such Assumed New Amethyst Stock Option as so assumed and
converted shall be an option to acquire that number of whole shares of New
Amethyst Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Holdings Common Stock subject to such
Holdings Stock Option immediately prior to the Merger 2 Effective Time
and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of New Amethyst
Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of Holdings Common Stock
of such Holdings Stock Option immediately prior to the Merger 2 Effective
Time

 



15  by (y) the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , that the exercise price and the
number of shares of New Amethyst Common Stock subject to the Assumed New
Amethyst Stock Option and the other terms and conditions of the Assumed New
Amethyst Stock Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and, in the case of Holdings Stock
Options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock options within the
meaning of Section 422 of the Code, consistent with the requirements of
Section 424 of the Code (it being the intention of the parties that this
_Section 2.3(b)_ (determined without regard to this proviso) is consistent
with such Sections of the Code).

(c) _Treatment of Holdings Stock Units in Merger 2_. As of the Merger 2
Effective Time, each Holdings Stock Unit Award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger 2 Effective Time, whether or not then vested,
shall be assumed by New Amethyst and shall be converted into an award of stock
units (an " _Assumed New Amethyst Stock Unit Award_ ") covering New Amethyst
Common Stock in accordance with this _Section 2.3(c)_. Each such Assumed New
Amethyst Stock Unit Award as so assumed and converted shall continue to have,
and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the
Holdings Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the Merger 2 Effective Time
(but taking into account any changes thereto provided for in this Agreement
and by reason of the Transactions). As of the Merger 2 Effective Time, each
such Assumed New Amethyst Stock Unit Award as so assumed and converted shall
be an award of stock units covering that number of shares of New Amethyst
Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Holdings Common Stock underlying such
Holdings Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the Merger 2 Effective Time
multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio.

 

(d) _Treatment of Holdings Performance-Vesting Stock Units in Merger 2_. As of
the Merger 2 Effective Time, each Holdings PSU Award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger 2 Effective Time shall be assumed by New
Amethyst and shall be converted at the Merger 2 Effective Time into an award
of stock units covering New Amethyst Common Stock (an " _Assumed New
Amethyst PSU Award_ ") in accordance with this _Section 2.3(d)_. Each such
Assumed New Amethyst PSU Award shall continue to have, and shall be subject
to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the Holdings PSU Award
immediately prior to the Merger 2 Effective Time (but substituting New
Amethyst for Holdings for purposes of the applicable "Total Shareholder
Return" criteria, and taking into account any other changes thereto provided
for in this Agreement and by reason of the Transactions). As of the Merger 2
Effective Time, each such Assumed New Amethyst PSU Award as so assumed and
converted shall be an award of stock units covering, at "target" levels of
achievement, that number of shares of New Amethyst Common Stock (rounded down
to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares
of Holdings Common Stock underlying such Holdings PSU Award at "target" levels
immediately prior to the Merger 2 Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the
Exchange Ratio.

 



16 (e) Not later than the Closing Date, AmSurg and Holdings shall jointly deliver
to those individuals who, immediately following the Merger 1 Effective Time,
will be the holders of New Amethyst Awards and those individuals who,
immediately following the Merger 2 Effective Time, will be the holders of
Assumed New Amethyst Stock Options, Assumed New Amethyst Stock Unit Awards
and Assumed New Amethyst PSU Awards any required notices setting forth such
holders rights pursuant to the relevant AmSurg Stock Plan or Holdings Stock
Plan and award agreements and stating that the related AmSurg Stock Options,
AmSurg Stock Unit Awards, AmSurg PSU Awards, AmSurg Restricted Stock, Holdings
Stock Options, Holdings Stock Unit Awards and Holdings PSU Awards have been
assumed by New Amethyst and converted as provided in this  _Section 2.3(e)_
and the New Amethyst Awards, Assumed New Amethyst Stock Options, Assumed New
Amethyst Stock Unit Awards and Assumed New Amethyst PSU Awards shall continue
in effect on the same terms and conditions subject, in each case, to the
adjustments required by this _Section 2.3(e)_ after giving effect to the
Transactions and the terms of the relevant AmSurg Stock Plan or Holdings Stock
Plan and related award agreements.

 

(f) Prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time, AmSurg and New Amethyst shall take
all necessary action for the assumption, conversion and adjustment of the
AmSurg Stock Options, AmSurg Stock Unit Awards and AmSurg PSU Awards described
in this _Section 2.3_ and the conversion of the AmSurg Restricted Stock
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_. Prior to the Merger 2 Effective
Time, AmSurg, Holdings and New Amethyst shall take all necessary action for
the assumption, conversion and adjustment of the Holdings Stock Options,
Holdings Stock Unit Awards and Holdings PSU Awards described in this _Section
2.3_. New Amethyst shall reserve for future issuance a number of shares of
New Amethyst Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares of New
Amethyst Common Stock that will be subject to the New Amethyst Awards, Assumed
New Amethyst Stock Options, Assumed New Amethyst Stock Unit Awards and
Assumed New Amethyst PSU Awards. Not later than the Closing Date, New Amethyst
shall file an effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or other
applicable form) with respect to the New Amethyst Common Stock issuable upon
exercise or settlement of each such New Amethyst Award (other than those
resulting from the conversion of the AmSurg Restricted Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)(ii)_), Assumed New Amethyst Stock Option, Assumed New
Amethyst Stock Unit Award and Assumed New Amethyst PSU Award and shall
distribute a prospectus relating to such Form S-8, and New Amethyst shall use
reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as any of such
awards remain outstanding.



 



17 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. AmSurg, New Amethyst and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of a Holdings Certificate, Holdings
Book-Entry Share, AmSurg Common Certificate, AmSurg Common Book-Entry Share,
AmSurg Preferred Certificate or AmSurg Preferred Book-Entry Share or any
other Person who is entitled to receive shares of New Amethyst Common Stock or
New Amethyst Series A-1 Preferred Stock as a result of Merger 1, or the Merger
2 Consideration or the Fractional Shares Cash Amount as a result of Merger 2,
such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld under the Code,
Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code or any provisions of
applicable state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the applicable Governmental
Entity, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the person(s) in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made.

2.5 _Treatment of Holdings Employee Stock Purchase Plans_. Prior to the Merger
2 Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Holdings or the appropriate
committee thereof shall take all reasonable actions, including adopting any
necessary resolutions or amendments with respect to the Holdings 2015 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan and the Holdings 2015 Provider Stock Purchase Plan (the "
_Holdings ESPPs_ ") to effectuate the following: (i) to cause each "Purchase
Period" (as defined in the Holdings ESPPs) in effect on the date of this
Agreement to be the final Purchase Period under such Holdings ESPP and the
options under such Holdings ESPP to be exercised on the earlier of (x) the
scheduled purchase date for such Purchase Period and (y) the date that is
seven business days prior to the expected Closing Date (with any participant
payroll deductions not applied to the purchase of shares returned to the
participant) and (ii) to terminate the Holdings ESPPs effective immediately
prior to the Closing Date.

OF AMSURG AND NEW AMETHYST

 

Except (a) as set forth in the AmSurg Disclosure Schedule (subject to _Section
8.15_) and (b) as otherwise disclosed or identified in the AmSurg SEC
Documents (other than (i) any forward-looking disclosures contained in the
"Forward Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" sections of the AmSurg SEC
Documents and any other disclosures included therein to the extent they are
primarily predictive, cautionary or forward looking in nature and (ii)
information included in, or incorporated by reference as, exhibits and

Document publicly filed or furnished prior to the date hereof is reasonably
specific as to matters and items such that the subject matter of such
disclosure is reasonably apparent on the face of the text of such disclosure
to be applicable to the representation set forth herein), AmSurg and New

its Subsidiaries (other than any Affiliated Medical Group) is bound relating
to the issued or unissued capital stock or other Equity Interests of AmSurg or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than any Affiliated Medical Group), or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for such capital stock or other
Equity Interests, or obligating AmSurg or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
any Affiliated Medical Group) to issue or sell any shares of its
capital stock or other Equity Interests, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for such capital stock of, or other Equity Interests in, AmSurg
or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any Affiliated Medical Group). Since

or other Equity Interests, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for

of AmSurg (other than any Affiliated Medical Group) is duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and is
owned, beneficially and of record, by AmSurg or one or more of its wholly-
owned Subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens. Each outstanding share of
capital stock or other Equity Interest in each AmSurg Affiliated Medical Group
is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights and is subject to a stock control agreement that prohibits
the sale or transfer of such equity interest without the consent of AmSurg or
an Affiliate of AmSurg and grants AmSurg the right to cause all or any portion

any shares of its capital stock or other Equity Interests, or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for such capital stock of, or
other Equity Interests in, any AmSurg Affiliated Medical Group. No AmSurg
Affiliated Medical Group is a party to any voting agreement with respect to
the voting of any of its Equity Interests. There are no outstanding
contractual obligations of AmSurg or any of its Subsidiaries to provide funds
to, or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or
otherwise) in, any Subsidiary of AmSurg or any other Person, other than
guarantees by AmSurg of any indebtedness or other obligations of any wholly-
owned Subsidiary of AmSurg.

Property that is necessary for or used or held for use in the conduct of the
business of AmSurg and its Subsidiaries in substantially the same manner as
presently conducted and currently proposed to be conducted. Neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by AmSurg, nor the performance of

consent to the continued use of, any rights of AmSurg or any of its
Subsidiaries in any Intellectual Property except as has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an
AmSurg Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,

claim, demand, or notice since January 1, 2013 (or earlier, if presently not
resolved) alleging any such infringement, misappropriation, dilution,
or violation (including any claim that AmSurg or any of its Subsidiaries must
license or refrain from using any Intellectual Property rights of any Person)
which alleged infringement, misappropriation, dilution, or violation, if true,
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an
AmSurg Material Adverse Effect.

Effect. Neither AmSurg nor any of its Subsidiaries has made or asserted any
charge, complaint, claim, demand or notice since January 1, 2013 (or earlier,
if presently not resolved) alleging any such infringement, misappropriation,
dilution, or violation which alleged infringement, misappropriation, dilution,
or violation, if true, would reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, an AmSurg Material Adverse Effect.

(d) AmSurg and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable steps
to maintain, police and protect the Intellectual Property that is material to
their business (" _AmSurg Material Intellectual Property_ "). Except as has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, an AmSurg Material Adverse Effect, all AmSurg Material
Intellectual Property that derives independent economic value, actual or
potential, from not being generally known to the public or to other persons

in confidence in accordance with protection procedures that are in accordance
with procedures customarily used in the industry to protect rights of like
importance and, to the Knowledge of AmSurg, adequate for protection. To the
Knowledge of AmSurg, there has been no unauthorized disclosure of any AmSurg
Material Intellectual Property. Except as has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an AmSurg Material
Adverse Effect, to the Knowledge of AmSurg, all former and current officers,
directors, employees, personnel, consultants, advisors, agents, and
independent contractors of AmSurg and its Subsidiaries, and each of their
predecessors, who have contributed to or participated in the conception and
development of Intellectual Property for such entities have entered into valid
and binding proprietary rights agreements with AmSurg or one of its
Subsidiaries or predecessors, vesting ownership of such Intellectual Property
in AmSurg or one of its Subsidiaries. No such Person has asserted, and to the

may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement promptly after receipt of such
comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. Each party and their
respective counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such
written responses and each party shall give due consideration to the

propose to approve, endorse, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or similar definitive agreement (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to any Competing Proposal;
(2) take any action to make the provisions of any takeover statute
inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by a Competing Proposal; (3)
terminate, amend, release, modify or knowingly fail to enforce any provision
of, or grant any permission, waiver or request under, any standstill,
confidentiality or similar agreement entered into by the applicable party in
respect of or in contemplation of a Competing Proposal (other than to the
extent the Holdings Board or the AmSurg Board, as applicable, determines in
good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to
take any of such actions under clause (3) would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law), or (4) propose to do any of the
foregoing. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 5.4(a)_ shall
relieve any party from its obligations under  _Section 5.6_.

 



86 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, including _Section
5.3_ but subject to compliance with this _Section 5.4_, prior to receipt of
the AmSurg Shareholder Approval, the AmSurg Board may, or, prior to receipt of
the Holdings Stockholder Approval, the Holdings Board may, in response to any
bona fide written Competing Proposal that was not, directly or indirectly,
solicited, initiated or knowingly encouraged in violation of this _Section
5.4_, effect an AmSurg Adverse Recommendation Change or a Holdings Adverse
Recommendation Change, as applicable, if and only if (i) the AmSurg Board or
the Holdings Board, as applicable, concludes in good faith, after consultation
with AmSurgs or Holdingss outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and
(ii) the Holdings Board or the AmSurg Board, as applicable, provides the other
party five (5) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take
such action (a " _Competing Proposal Notice_ "), which notice shall include
the information with respect to such Competing Proposal that is specified in
_Section 5.4(c)_ (it being agreed that neither the delivery of such notice by
a party nor any public announcement thereof that such party determines it is
required to make under applicable Law shall constitute an AmSurg Adverse
Recommendation Change or a Holdings Adverse Recommendation Change, as
applicable, unless and until such party shall have failed at or prior to the
end of the period referred to in clause (iii) below (and, upon the occurrence
of such failure, such notice and such public announcement shall constitute an
AmSurg Adverse Recommendation Change or a Holdings Adverse Recommendation
Change, as applicable) to publicly announce that it (A) is recommending the
Transactions and (B) has determined that such other Competing Proposal (taking
into account (x) any modifications or adjustments made to the Transactions
agreed to by the other party in writing and (y) any modifications or
adjustments made to such other Competing Proposal) is not a Superior Proposal
and has publicly rejected such Competing Proposal); (iii) during the five (5)
Business Days following such written notice (the " _Negotiation Period_ "), if
requested by the other party, the Board of Directors effecting the
recommendation change and its Representatives have negotiated in good faith
with the other party regarding any revisions to the terms of the Transactions
proposed by the other party in response to such Competing Proposal; and (iv)
at the end of the five (5) Business Day period described in the foregoing
clause (iii), the AmSurg Board or Holdings Board, as applicable, concludes in
good faith, after consultation with AmSurgs or Holdingss outside legal
counsel and financial advisors (and taking into account any adjustment or
modification of the terms of this Agreement to which the other party has
agreed in writing to make to the terms of the Transactions), that the
Competing Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal and, after consultation
with AmSurgs or Holdingss outside legal counsel, that the failure to make
an AmSurg Adverse Recommendation Change or Holdings Adverse Recommendation
Change, as applicable, would be inconsistent with the exercise by the AmSurg
Board or Holdings Board of its fiduciary duties to the 

 



87  shareholders of AmSurg or stockholders of Holdings under applicable Law. Any
material amendment or modification to any Competing Proposal shall require a
new Competing Proposal Notice and the Negotiation Period shall be extended by
an additional three (3) Business Days from the date of receipt of such new
Competing Proposal Notice.

 

(c) In addition to the obligations of Holdings and AmSurg set forth in
_Section 5.4(a)_ and _Section 5.4(b)_, Holdings or AmSurg shall promptly,
and in any event no later than 24 hours, after it receives (i) any Competing
Proposal or indication by any Person that it intends to make or is considering
making a Competing Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information
relating to Holdings or AmSurg or their respective Subsidiaries other than
requests for information in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice and unrelated to a Competing Proposal or (iii) any inquiry
or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Competing Proposal,
notify the other party orally and in writing of any of the foregoing
occurrences and provide a reasonably detailed description of such request,
inquiry or Competing Proposal, including any modifications thereto. Each
party shall keep the other party reasonably informed (orally and in writing)
on a current basis (and in any event at the other partys request and
otherwise no later than 24 hours after the occurrence of any material
changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of the status of any
request, inquiry or Competing Proposal (including the terms and conditions
thereof and of any modification thereto), and any material developments,
discussions and negotiations, including furnishing copies of any written
inquiries, material correspondence and draft documentation, and written
summaries of any material oral inquiries or discussions. Without limiting the
foregoing, each party shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
notify the other party orally and in writing if it determines to begin
providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning a
Competing Proposal pursuant to _Section 5.4_. Each of Holdings and AmSurg
agrees that, subject to applicable restrictions under applicable Law, it
shall, prior to or concurrent with the time it is provided to any third
parties, provide to the other party any non-public information concerning
Holdings or AmSurg and their respective Subsidiaries that Holdings or AmSurg
provided to any third party in connection with any Competing Proposal which
was not previously provided to the other party.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.4_ to the contrary, at any
time prior to obtaining the Holdings Stockholder Approval or the AmSurg
Shareholder Approval, the Holdings Board or the AmSurg Board may make a
Holdings Adverse Recommendation Change or an AmSurg Adverse Recommendation
Change, as applicable, if (i) such board determines that an Intervening Event
has occurred and is continuing and (ii) such board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to make a Holdings
Adverse Recommendation Change or an AmSurg Adverse Recommendation Change, as
applicable, in response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the applicable partys stockholders or shareholders,
as applicable, under applicable Law; _provided_ that (x) the 

 



88  Holdings Board or the AmSurg Board has given the other party at least five
(5) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action
and specifying in reasonable detail the circumstances related to such
determination and (y) prior to effecting a Holdings Adverse Recommendation
Change or an AmSurg Adverse Recommendation Change, the applicable party has
negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith
with the other party during such notice period to the extent such other party
wishes to negotiate, to enable such party to revise the terms of this
Agreement, such that the failure to make a Holdings Adverse Recommendation
Change or an AmSurg Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, would not
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders or shareholders, as
applicable, under applicable Law.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section _5.4 shall be deemed to prohibit
AmSurg, Holdings, the AmSurg Board, the Holdings Board or any committee of
the AmSurg Board or the Holdings Board from (i) complying with its disclosure
obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to a Competing
Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its shareholders or stockholders,
as applicable, a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under
the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to shareholders) or (ii) making
any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the shareholders of AmSurg or
the stockholders of Holdings, as applicable, pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under
the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the shareholders of AmSurg
or the stockholders of Holdings, as applicable); _provided_ that neither
AmSurg nor the AmSurg Board may effect an AmSurg Adverse Recommendation
Change and neither Holdings nor the Holdings Board may effect a Holdings
Adverse Recommendation Change, in each case except in accordance with _Section
5.4(d)_. Actions permitted under this _Section 5.4(e)_ shall not be a basis
for Holdings or AmSurg to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(iii)_ or _Section 7.1(d)(iii)_, as applicable.

 

(f) Any failure of Holdingss or AmSurgs respective Subsidiaries or its and
their respective Representatives to fully comply with this _Section 5.4_ (as
if such Subsidiaries or Representatives were directly subject to this _Section
5.4_) shall be deemed a breach of this _Section 5.4_ by Holdings or AmSurg,
as applicable.

 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) "Competing Proposal" shall mean, other than the Transactions, any proposal
or offer from a third party for a transaction or a series of related
transactions relating to (A) a merger, reorganization, sale of assets, share
exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation, joint venture or similar transaction involving Holdings
or AmSurg, or any of their respective Subsidiaries; (B) the acquisition
(whether by merger, consolidation, equity investment, joint venture or
otherwise) by any Person of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated
assets of 

 



89  Holdings or AmSurg, and their respective Subsidiaries, as determined on a
book-value or fair-market-value basis; (C) the purchase or acquisition, in any
manner, directly or indirectly, by any Person of fifteen percent (15%) or
more of the issued and outstanding shares of the Holdings Common Stock or the
AmSurg Common Stock or any other Equity Interests in Holdings or AmSurg, (D)
any purchase, acquisition, tender offer or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in any Person beneficially owning fifteen percent
(15%) or more of the shares of Holdings Common Stock or AmSurg Common Stock or
any other Equity Interests of Holdings, AmSurg or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or (E) any combination of the foregoing.

(ii) "Intervening Event" means any material event, development or change in
circumstances that first occurs, arises or becomes known to Holdings or AmSurg
or its respective board after the date of this Agreement, to the extent that
such event, development or change in circumstances was not reasonably
foreseeable as of the date of this Agreement (or if known or reasonably
foreseeable, the probability of magnitude of consequences of which were not
known or reasonably foreseeable); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the following events, developments or changes in circumstances
constitute an Intervening Event: (1) the receipt, existence or terms of a
Competing Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof; (2)
any change in the price, or change in trading volume, of Holdings Common
Stock or AmSurg Common Stock ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the exception set
forth in this clause (2) shall not apply to the underlying causes giving rise
to or contributing to such change or prevent any of such underlying causes
from being taken into account in determining whether an Intervening Event has
occurred); (3) meeting or exceeding internal or analysts expectations,
projections or results of operations (provided, however, that the exception
set forth in this clause (3) shall not apply to the underlying causes giving
rise to or contributing to such circumstances or prevent any of such
underlying causes from being taken into account in determining whether an
Intervening Event has occurred); and (4) any action taken by either party
pursuant to and in compliance with the affirmative covenants set forth in
_Section 5.6_, and the consequences of any such action.

 

(iii) "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written Competing Proposal (except
the references therein to "fifteen percent (15%)" shall be replaced by
"eighty percent (80)%") made by a third party which was not solicited by
Holdings or AmSurg or any of their respective Representatives and which, in
the good faith judgment of the Holdings Board or the AmSurg Board, as
applicable, and after consultation with its outside financial and legal
advisors, taking into account the various legal, financial and regulatory
aspects of the Competing Proposal, including the financing terms thereof, and
the third party making such Competing Proposal (A) if accepted, is reasonably
likely to be consummated, (B) if consummated, would result in a transaction
that is more favorable to Holdingss stockholders or AmSurgs shareholders,
as applicable, from a financial point of view, than the Mergers and the other
Transactions contemplated hereby (after giving effect to all adjustments or
modifications to the terms thereof which may be agreed in writing to be made
by the other party (including pursuant to _Section 5.4(b)_)) and (C) if a
cash transaction (in whole or in part), financing for which is then fully
committed or reasonably determined to be available.

 



90 5.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice, each of Holdings and AmSurg shall (and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives to) afford to the other
party and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours,
during the period prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time, to all its properties,
books, Contracts and records and its officers, employees and
Representatives and, during such period, each of Holdings and AmSurg shall
(and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to) furnish promptly to
the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement
and other document filed, published, announced or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of applicable securities Laws (other than
reports or documents which such party is not permitted to disclose under
applicable Law) and (ii) consistent with its obligations under applicable
Law, all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel
as the other party may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , none of
Holdings or AmSurg or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Representatives
shall be required to provide access to or disclose information where such
information or access would, in the reasonable judgment of such party, (x)
breach any agreement with any third party, (y) constitute a waiver of the
attorney-client or other privilege held by such party or (z) otherwise violate
any applicable Law. In the event any of the restrictions in clauses (x)
through (z) of the foregoing sentence shall apply, each of the parties shall
advise the other party of the subject matter of any such information that
cannot be disclosed and shall use their reasonable best efforts to make
appropriate alternate disclosure arrangements, including adopting additional
specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of sensitive material and
to ensure compliance with applicable Laws. Any such information provided
pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ shall be held in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of that certain letter
agreement, dated January 26, 2016, as amended, between AmSurg and Holdings
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and that certain Clean Team
Confidentiality Agreement, dated February 18, 2016, between AmSurg and
Holdings (the " _Clean Team Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality Agreement and
Clean Team Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

 

(b) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective Representatives
or information provided, made available or delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of any other party set forth herein.

 



91 5.6 _Appropriate Action_.

 

(a) AmSurg and Holdings shall use their reasonable best efforts to take or
cause to be taken all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement, including using their reasonable best
efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all waivers, permits, consents,
approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of all Governmental
Entities and parties to Contracts with AmSurg, Holdings or any of their
respective Subsidiaries that may be or become necessary for the performance of
obligations pursuant to this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. The parties shall cooperate and assist one
another in good faith (i) in connection with all actions to be taken pursuant
to this _Section 5.6(a)_, including the preparation and making of the
filings referred to herein and, if requested, amending or furnishing
additional information thereunder and (ii) in seeking, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, to obtain all such waivers, permits,
consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each party
agrees to make any filings required to be made pursuant to the HSR Act or
other applicable federal or state antitrust, competition, fair trade or
similar applicable Laws with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
reasonably practicable (but in any event within ten (10) Business Days of the
date of this Agreement) and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable
to the appropriate Governmental Entities any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested by such Governmental Entities
pursuant to the HSR Act or such other applicable federal or state
antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar Laws. All such antitrust
filings to be made shall be made in substantial compliance with the
requirements of the HSR Act and such other applicable federal or state
antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar Laws, as applicable.

(b) In furtherance, and without limiting the generality, of the foregoing, the
parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate with and
assist each other in good faith to (A) determine, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, which filings are required to be made pursuant to the HSR Act or
other applicable federal or state antitrust, competition, fair trade or
similar Laws with respect to the Transactions, (B) provide or cause to be
provided as promptly as reasonably practicable to the other party all
necessary information and assistance as any Governmental Entity may from time
to time require of such party in connection with obtaining the relevant
waivers, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications, Orders
or expiration of waiting periods in relation to such filings or in connection
with any other review or investigation of the Transactions by a Governmental
Entity pursuant to the HSR Act or other applicable federal or state antitrust,
competition, fair trade or similar Laws and (C) provide or cause to be
provided as promptly as reasonably practicable all assistance and cooperation
to allow the other party to prepare and submit any such filings or

 



92  submissions required to be submitted under the HSR Act or other applicable
federal or state antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar Laws, including
providing to the other party any information that the other party may from
time to time require for the purpose of any filing with, notification to,
application with, or request for further information made by, any Governmental
Entity in respect of any such filing and (ii) (A) cooperate with and assist
each other in good faith to devise and implement a joint strategy for making
such filings, including the timing thereof, and for obtaining any related
antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar clearances, (B) consult in
advance with the other party and in good faith take the other partys views
into account regarding the overall strategic direction of obtaining such
antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar clearances and (C) consult with
the other party prior to taking any material substantive position in any
written submissions or, to the extent practicable, in any discussions with
Governmental Entities with respect to such antitrust, competition, fair
trade or similar clearances, including any position as to a Divestiture. To
the extent permitted by applicable Law, each party shall permit the other
party to review and discuss in advance, and shall consider in good faith the
views of the other party in connection with, any analyses, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, written arguments, opinions, written proposals or other
materials to be submitted to the Governmental Entities. To the extent
permitted by applicable Law, each party shall keep the other apprised of the
material content and status of any material communications with, and material
communications from, any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions,
including promptly notifying the other party of any material communication it
receives from any Governmental Entity relating to any review or investigation
of the Transactions under the HSR Act or other applicable federal or state
antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar Laws. To the extent permitted
by applicable Law, the parties shall, and shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause their respective affiliates to use their reasonable best
efforts to, provide each other with copies of all material correspondence,
filings or communications between them or any of their respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be redacted (1) to
remove references concerning the valuation of Holdings and its Subsidiaries or
AmSurg and its Subsidiaries, as applicable; (2) as necessary to comply with
any Contract or Laws; and (3) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-
client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns.

(c) Subject to the penultimate sentence of this  _Section 5.6(c)_, AmSurg
and Holdings shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to,
use their reasonable best efforts to obtain approval of the consummation of
the Transactions by any antitrust or competition Governmental Entity,
including taking all commercially reasonable steps necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every legal impediment under any applicable federal or
state antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar Law that may be asserted
by any antitrust or competition Governmental Entity so as to enable the
parties hereto to close the Transactions as promptly as reasonably
practicable, and in any event prior to the Outside Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this

 



93  Agreement, neither AmSurg nor Holdings nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries and affiliates shall be required to agree to any sale, transfer,
license, separate holding, divestiture or other disposition of, or to any
prohibition of or any limitation on the acquisition, ownership, operation,
effective control or exercise of full rights of ownership, or other
modification of rights in respect of, any material assets or businesses,
or otherwise modify any material business practice or contractual
relationship (each, a " _Divestiture_ ") if such Divestiture, individually or
in the aggregate, would or would reasonably be expected to be materially
adverse to (i) AmSurg and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) Holdings
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (iii) AmSurg, Holdings and their
respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, but deemed for this purpose to be
the same size as AmSurg and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. In the event
of any conflict between subsections (a), (b) or (c) of this _Section 5.6_,
the provisions of this _Section 5.6(c)_ shall, with respect to the matters
addressed in this _Section 5.6(c)_, supersede the provisions of subsection
(a) and (b) of this _Section 5.6_.

(d) Each party shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, respond
as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries or requests for
information and documentary material received from any Governmental Entity in
connection with any antitrust or competition matters related to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) Any fee or expense (other than any attorneys fees) payable by any party
in connection with the HSR Act or other applicable federal or state antitrust,
competition, fair trade or similar Laws with respect to the Transactions shall
be borne, in each case, equally by AmSurg and Holdings.

5.7 _Certain Notices_. Each party shall give prompt notice to the other
parties if any of the following occur after the date of this Agreement: (a)
receipt of any notice or other communication in writing from any Person
alleging that the consent or approval of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions; (b) receipt of any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity, the NASDAQ or the NYSE (or any
other securities market) in connection with the Transactions; or (c) such
party becoming aware of the occurrence of an event that could prevent or delay
beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the Transactions or that would
reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to the Mergers set
forth in _Article 6_ not being satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ shall not cure any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder
to the party receiving such notice. AmSurg and Holdings shall promptly
provide, to the extent not publicly available, the other party with copies of
all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity in connection with
the Transactions.

 



94 5.8 _Public Announcements_. Each party agrees that no public release or
announcement concerning the Transactions shall be issued by any party without
the prior written consent of Holdings and AmSurg (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except to the extent such
release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or the rules or
regulations of any applicable securities exchange or regulatory or
governmental body to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the
party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable
best efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance. Holdings and AmSurg agree
that the press release announcing the execution and delivery of this
Agreement shall be a joint release in the form heretofore agreed by the
parties. In addition, subject to the right of the Holdings Board to make a
Holdings Adverse Recommendation Change or the AmSurg Board to make an AmSurg
Adverse Recommendation Change, in each case in accordance with and subject to
the terms and conditions of _Section 5.4_, Holdings and AmSurg agree to cause
their respective directors and officers to refrain from taking any position in
any public statement that is (a) contrary to the positions previously taken
by AmSurg and Holdings with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions,
including the Mergers or (b) reasonably likely to have a material adverse
impact on the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the Transactions.

5.9 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Merger 2 Effective Time, New Amethyst shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless, and shall advance expenses as incurred, to the
fullest extent permitted under (i) applicable Law, (ii) Holdings and AmSurgs
organizational documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement and (iii)
any Contract of Holdings, AmSurg or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, each present and former director and
officer of Holdings, AmSurg and any of their respective Subsidiaries (in each
case, when acting in such capacity) (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and,
collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, settlements, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at, prior to or
after the Merger 2 Effective Time, including in connection with this Agreement
or the Transactions.

(b) New Amethyst agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect
of, acts or omissions occurring prior to the Merger 2 Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions) now existing
in favor of an Indemnitee as provided in charter, bylaws or
other organizational documents shall survive the Mergers and shall

 



95  continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a
period of no less than six (6) years from the Merger 2 Effective Time, New
Amethyst shall maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses provisions of the organizational documents of
Holdings, AmSurg or any of their respective Subsidiaries in effect as of the
date of this Agreement, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any
such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who immediately before the Merger 1 Effective
Time were current or former directors or officers of Holdings, AmSurg or any
of their respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any
Proceeding pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall
continue until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

(c) For six (6) years from and after the Merger 2 Effective Time, New Amethyst
shall maintain for the benefit of the Indemnitees, a DandO insurance policy
that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Merger 2
Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to
and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the existing policy
of Holdings, or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that New
Amethyst shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance
in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by AmSurg prior to the date
of this Agreement (it being understood and agreed that, in the event that the
requisite coverage is not available for an annual premium less than or equal
to 250% of such last annual premium, New Amethyst shall nevertheless be
obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained for 250% of such last
annual premium). The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall
be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail" policies have been obtained
prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time, which policies provide such directors
and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Merger 2 Effective Time, including in respect of the Transactions.

 

(d) In the event that New Amethyst or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each case, New Amethyst shall cause proper provision
to be made so that such successor or assign shall expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under Holdingss, AmSurgs or any of their
respective Subsidiaries organizational documents in effect as of the date of
this Agreement or in any Contract of Holdings, AmSurg or any of their

 



96  respective Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement. The
obligations of New Amethyst under this _Section 5.9_ shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any
Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies unless (x) such termination or
modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee
shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies
shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.9_).

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to
Holdings, AmSurg or any of their respective Subsidiaries for any of their
respective directors or officers, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.9_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

5.10 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Holdings and AmSurg shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the shares of New Amethyst Common Stock and the shares
of New Amethyst Series A-1 Preferred Stock to be duly listed on the NYSE prior
to the Merger 1 Effective Time.

2017 (the " _Protection Period_ "), New Amethyst shall cause the employees of
Holdings and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Legacy
Holdings Employees_ ") and the employees of AmSurg and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Legacy AmSurg Employees_ "), which
defined terms shall in each case not include any such employees covered by
collective bargaining or other labor agreements, with compensation and
employee benefits during their employment during the Protection Period that
either (x) are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided
(A) in the case of the Legacy Holdings Employees, to the Legacy Holdings
Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date or (B) in the case of the
Legacy AmSurg Employees, to the Legacy AmSurg Employees immediately prior to
the Closing Date, or (y) constitute a migration to a common platform of
compensation or employee benefits to be provided to similarly situated
Legacy Holdings Employees and Legacy AmSurg Employees (which migration, as to
any particular element of compensation or benefits, shall occur with respect
to substantially all similarly situated employees at substantially the same
time); provided, that this _Section 5.14(a)_ shall not apply to post-Closing
equity compensation awards (which are covered by _Section 5.14(b)_), post-
Closing severance pay and termination benefits (which are covered by _Section
5.14(c)_) or annual (or other short-term) cash incentive awards (which are
covered by _Section 5.14(d)_). Subject to the other provisions of this
_Section 5.14_, New Amethyst shall cause to be honored, in accordance with
their terms, all Holdings Benefit Plans and all AmSurg Benefit Plans in
accordance with the terms thereof as of the Closing Date, provided that such
plans or agreements may be amended, terminated or suspended in accordance with
their terms and Applicable Law.

 

(b) Following the Closing Date, equity awards shall be granted to employees of
New Amethyst and its Subsidiaries in the sole discretion of the New Amethyst
Board (or its compensation committee or other designee), except that the
equity grant policies of New Amethyst after the Closing shall not take into
account the status of a grantee as a Legacy Holdings Employee or a Legacy
AmSurg Employee.

(c) New Amethyst shall cause to be maintained during the Protection Period
those Holdings Benefit Plans and AmSurg Benefit Plans providing severance pay
and termination benefits that are set forth on Section 5.14(c) of the AmSurg
Disclosure Schedule such that, in the event of the termination of employment
of any Legacy Holdings Employee or any Legacy AmSurg Employee during the
Protection Period, such individual shall be entitled to severance pay and
termination benefits set forth under such disclosed arrangement applicable to
such termination (if any), and subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in such Holdings Benefit Plan or AmSurg Benefit Plan.

(d) New Amethyst shall cause to be maintained through December 31, 2017 those
annual (or other short-term) cash incentive award programs covering the
Legacy Holdings Employees and the Legacy AmSurg Employees substantially in the
form as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



99 (e) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans in which
the Legacy Holdings Employees or Legacy AmSurg Employees commence to
participate after the Closing (the "New Plans"), each Legacy Holdings Employee
and Legacy AmSurg Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service
with Holdings and its Subsidiaries or AmSurg and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, and their respective predecessors, before the Closing Date, to the
same extent as such individual was entitled, before the Closing, to credit
for such service under any similar Holdings Benefit Plan or AmSurg Benefit
Plan in which such individual participated or was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Closing Date (such plans, collectively, the
"Old Plans"), provided that the foregoing shall not apply (x) with respect to
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period
of service or (y) under any New Plan as to which neither the Legacy Holdings
Employees nor the Legacy AmSurg Employees are provided with such service
credit. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A)
each Legacy Holdings Employee and Legacy AmSurg Employee who ceases to be
eligible to participate in an Old Plan shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any corresponding New Plan to the
extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable and intended to replace the
benefits under any such Old Plan, and (B) for purposes of any New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits, New Amethyst
shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Legacy Holdings Employee
and Legacy AmSurg Employee and his or her covered dependents, except to the
extent such conditions would not have been waived under the applicable
Old Plan, and New Amethyst shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Legacy Holdings Employee or Legacy AmSurg Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such Legacy Holdings Employees or Legacy AmSurg Employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring New
Amethyst or any of its Subsidiaries to continue (or resume) the employment of
any specific person following the Closing Date. In addition, no provision of
this Section 5.14 shall be construed to create any third party beneficiary
rights in any employee, officer, current or former director or consultant
of AmSurg or Holdings or any of their Subsidiaries, or any beneficiary of
such employee, officer, director or consultant under any employee benefit
plan, program, policy or arrangement sponsored by any such Person, nor is any
provision of this Section 5.14 intended to constitute an amendment to any
such employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement.

the assistance of an integration team, the members of which shall be persons

Commitment Letter that are within AmSurgs or Holdingss control and to
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing and (B) if any portion of
the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter (including the flex provisions), to arrange to
obtain alternative financing, including from alternative sources, on terms and
conditions not materially less favorable than the terms and conditions
(including the flex provisions) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. For
purposes of this Agreement, references to " _Financing_ " mean the financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted or required, as the
case may be, to be amended, modified or replaced by this _Section 5.16_ and

Merger 2 Effective Time on terms and conditions that satisfy the requirements

appropriate documentation in connection with the Change of Control Offers,
including the offers to purchase and other related documents (collectively,
the " _Change of Control Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) AmSurg shall not be

contemplated by this Agreement. Each Change of Control Offer shall be
conducted in compliance with applicable Law, including SEC rules and
regulations, to the extent applicable. The parties shall, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to

requested by the other party in connection with the Change of Control Offers.

time prior to the Discharge or the completion of the Change of Control Offers,
as applicable, any information should be discovered by the parties that should
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to such documentation so that such
documentation shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein in order to make
the statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made,

hold harmless each of the other parties, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Affiliates, and their respective directors, managers, general partners,

incurred by them in connection with the transactions contemplated by _Section
5.17(a)_, _(b)_ , _(c)_ or  _(d)_ and any information utilized in connection
therewith, except to the extent any of the foregoing arises from the bad
faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnified party, any of
its Subsidiaries, or any of their Representatives, or to historical
information relating to the indemnified party or its Subsidiaries provided by
or on behalf of the indemnified party. Except as provided in _Section
5.17(b)(i)_, any fee or expense (other than any attorneys fees) payable by
any party in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter, the Financing and any
of the transactions set forth in this _Section 5.17_ shall be borne, in each
case, equally by AmSurg and Holdings. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, neither the pendency nor consummation of any
transactions contemplated by _Section 5.17(a)_ _(b)_ , _(c)_ or _(d)_ will be
a condition to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Mergers or
the other Transactions.

 



104 (f) For the avoidance of doubt, (i) all debt outstanding under the Envision
2022 Notes shall remain outstanding from and after the Merger 2 Effective
Time and the consummation of the Mergers and the other Transactions until
repaid, repurchased, exchanged, modified, redeemed or satisfied and discharged

shall each use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Law and SEC rules and regulations to file
registration statements on Form 8-A with respect to the New Amethyst Common
Stock and the New Amethyst Series A-1 Preferred Stock pursuant to Section
12(b) of the Exchange Act prior to the effective date of the Form S-4.

 

5.19 _Delisting; Deregistration_. New Amethyst shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be

delisting by New Amethyst of the Holdings Common Stock from the NYSE, (ii)
the delisting by New Amethyst of the AmSurg Common Stock and the AmSurg
Series A-1 Preferred Stock from the NASDAQ and (iii) the deregistration of the
Holdings Common Stock, the AmSurg Common Stock and the AmSurg Series A-1
Preferred Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the
Merger 2 Effective Time.

5.20 _Support of Transaction_. Without limiting any other covenant contained
in _Article 5_ , which covenants shall control to the extent of any conflict
with the succeeding provisions of this _Section 5.20_, AmSurg, New Amethyst
and Holdings shall each, and shall each cause their respective Subsidiaries
to: (a) use reasonable best efforts to assemble, prepare and file any
information (and, as needed, to supplement such information) as may be
reasonably necessary to obtain as promptly as practicable all governmental
and regulatory consents required to be obtained in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, (b) use reasonable best efforts to obtain
all material consents and approvals of third parties that any of AmSurg,
Holdings or their respective Affiliates are required to obtain in order to
consummate the Mergers and (c) take such other action as may reasonably be
necessary or as another party may reasonably request to satisfy the conditions
of  _Article 6_ or otherwise to comply with this Agreement and to

 



105  consummate the transaction contemplated hereby as soon as practicable;
_provided_ , that any fee or expense (other than any attorneys fees) payable
by any party in connection with the foregoing clauses (a), (b) and (c) shall
be borne, in each case, equally by Holdings and AmSurg. For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties obligations with respect to obtaining the Financing are
exclusively governed by  _Section 5.16_ and with respect to HSR Act matters
are exclusively governed by _Section 5.6_.

5.21 _Envision and Intermediate Mergers_. Holdings shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be
done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Law to consummate, immediately prior to the Closing, (i) the
merger of Envision with and into Envision Healthcare Intermediate Corporation,
a Delaware corporation (" _Intermediate_ "), with Intermediate continuing as
the surviving corporation (the " _Envision Merger_ "), and (ii) the merger of
Intermediate with and into Holdings, with Holdings continuing as the surviving
corporation (the " _Intermediate Merger_ ").

 

5.22 _Further Assurances_. Each party hereto agrees that, from time to time
after the Closing Date, it will execute and deliver or cause its respective
Affiliates to execute and deliver such further instruments, and take (or cause
their respective Affiliates to take) such other action, as may be reasonably
necessary to carry out the purposes and intents of this Agreement.

party fails to pay any amounts due under this _Section 7.3_ and, in order to

shall pay interest on such amounts from the date payment of such amounts were
due to the date of actual payment at the rate equal to the prime rate
published in the Wall Street Journal for the relevant period, together with
the costs and expenses of the other party (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit. Notwithstanding anything to the

the AmSurg Termination Fee is payable and actually paid to Holdings or AmSurg
in accordance with this _Section 7.3_, payment of such Holdings Termination
Fee or AmSurg Termination Fee, as applicable, shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the non-terminating party against any other party or such other
partys stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, directors, officers,
affiliates and other Representatives, for any loss or damage based upon,
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any contract or agreement
executed in connection herewith or the negotiation, execution or performance
hereof or the Transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except in the
case of Willful Breach or fraud. Solely for purposes of establishing the basis
for the amount thereof, and without in any way increasing the amount of the
Holdings Termination Fee or the AmSurg Termination Fee, expanding the
circumstances in which the Holdings Termination Fee or the AmSurg Termination
Fee, as applicable, is to be paid or restricting or modifying the other rights
of any party hereunder, in the event of the valid termination of this
Agreement under circumstances in which the Holdings Termination Fee or the
AmSurg Termination Fee is payable pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, it is
agreed that each of the Holdings Termination Fee and the AmSurg Termination
Fee is liquidated damages, and not a penalty, and the payment thereof in such
circumstances is supported by due and sufficient consideration; _provided_ ,

 



114  that no payment of a Holdings Termination Fee or an AmSurg Termination Fee
shall be considered in lieu of, or a replacement or substitution for, damages
incurred in the event of any Willful Breach or fraud. Notwithstanding any
provision in this _Section 7.3_ to the contrary, in no event shall either
party be required to pay the AmSurg Termination Fee or the Holdings
Termination Fee, as applicable, or the Expenses of either party on more than
one occasion.

supplemented by the parties by action taken or authorized by their respective
Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time, whether
before or after the Holdings Stockholder Approval or the AmSurg Shareholder
Approval has been obtained;  _provided_ , that after the Holdings Stockholder
Approval or the AmSurg Shareholder Approval has been obtained, no amendment
shall be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires further approval or
adoption by the stockholders of Holdings or shareholders of AmSurg without
such further approval or adoption. This Agreement may not be amended, modified
or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise,
except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment
hereto, signed on behalf of each of the parties in interest at the time of the
amendment. To the extent any amendment, modification or supplement to _Section
7.4_, _8.9_ or _8.11_ is sought which is adverse to the rights of the
Lenders, the prior written consent of the Lenders shall be required before
such amendment, modification or supplement is rendered effective.

 

7.5 _Extension of Time; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Merger 1 Effective
Time, the parties may, by action taken or authorized by their respective
Boards of Directors, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other
parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other parties set forth in this Agreement or any document delivered
pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions of the other parties contained herein; _provided_ , that after
the Holdings Stockholder Approval or the AmSurg Shareholder Approval has been
obtained, no waiver may be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires
further approval or adoption by the stockholders of Holdings or shareholders
of AmSurg, as applicable, without such further approval or adoption. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized
officer on behalf of such party. No failure or delay of any party in
exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof,
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any
course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the parties
hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which
they would otherwise have hereunder.

8.5 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.

8.6 _Severability_. If any term, condition or other provision (or part
thereof) of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced
by any rule of Law or public policy, all other terms, conditions and
provisions (or parts thereof) of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.
Upon such determination that any term, condition or other provision (or part
thereof) is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

8.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, the
Holdings Disclosure Schedules, the AmSurg Disclosure Schedules and the other
documents delivered pursuant hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement and the
Clean Team Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties and
supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among
the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and,
except as otherwise expressly provided herein or therein, are not intended to
confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder or thereunder.

 



137 8.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in
whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

 

8.9 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, other than
pursuant to (i) _Section 5.9_, to the extent it applies to the Indemnitees
and (ii) _Section 7.4_, _8.9_ and _8.11_ , to the extent they apply to the
Lenders, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

 

8.10 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation_. Each party has participated in the
drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender
shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall
include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include
masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words "include"
and "including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of
limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." As used in this Agreement, references to a "party" or the
"parties" are intended to refer to a party to this Agreement or the parties
to this Agreement. Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this
Agreement to "Sections," "Exhibits," "Annexes" and "Schedules" are intended
to refer to Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules to
this Agreement. All references in this Agreement to "$" are intended to refer
to U.S. dollars. Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the term
"or" shall not be deemed to be exclusive. In this Agreement, when determining
whether an item is "material" to Holdings or its Subsidiary or AmSurg or its
Subsidiary, the term "material" shall be interpreted to mean, as applicable,
"material to the business of Holdings and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole"
or "material to the business of AmSurg and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole."

 



138 8.11 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_.

 

(a) Except to the extent the Mergers may be required to be governed by the
laws of the State of Tennessee, this Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to laws that may be applicable under conflicts of laws principles
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Debt Commitment
Letter and the performance thereof by the Lenders shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof.

(b) Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have
jurisdiction, any federal court of the United States of America, sitting in
Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any Proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each
of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to
commence any such Proceeding except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim
in respect of any such Proceeding may be heard and determined in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such
federal court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of venue of any such Proceeding in any such court, and (iv)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such Proceeding in any such court. Each of the
parties agrees that a final judgment in any such Proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in _Section 8.2_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any
party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each of the parties hereto
agrees that it will not bring or support any Proceeding against the Lenders in
any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement other than pursuant to, and subject to the limitations
set forth in, the Debt Commitment Letter.

 



139 (c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN
CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED
THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND
(IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.11(c)_.

 

8.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 

8.13 _Delivery by Facsimile or Email_. This Agreement, and any amendments
hereto, waivers hereof or consents or notifications hereunder, to the extent
signed and delivered by facsimile or by email with scan attachment, shall be
treated in all manner and respects as an original contract and shall be
considered to have the same binding legal effects as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party, each
other party shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other parties. No party shall raise the use of facsimile or email to deliver a
signature or the fact that any signature or Contract was transmitted or
communicated by facsimile or email with scan attachment as a defense to the
formation of a legally binding contract, and each such party forever waives
any such defense.

 



140 8.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent actual or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. The parties
waive, in connection with any action for specific performance or injunctive
relief, the defense of adequacy of remedies at Law and any requirement under
Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable
relief.

8.15 _Disclosure Schedules_. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the
inclusion of any items or information in the Disclosure Schedules that are
not required by this Agreement to be so included is solely for the convenience
of parties, (b) the disclosure by the parties of any matter in the Disclosure
Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgement by any party
that the matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or
that the matter is material or significant, (c) if any section of the
Disclosure Schedules lists an item or information in such a way as to make
its relevance to the disclosure required by or provided in another section of
the Disclosure Schedules or the statements contained in any Section of this
Agreement reasonably apparent, the matter shall be deemed to have
been disclosed in or with respect to such other section, notwithstanding the
omission of an appropriate cross-reference to such other section or the
omission of a reference in the particular representation and warranty to such
section of the Disclosure Schedules, (d) except as provided in clause (c)
above, headings have been inserted in the Disclosure Schedules for convenience
of reference only, (e) the Disclosure Schedules are qualified in their
entirety by reference to specific provisions of this Agreement and (f) the
Disclosure Schedules and the information and statements contained therein are
not intended to constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting,
representations or warranties of the parties except as and to the extent
provided in this Agreement.

_THIRD_ : The nature of the business of the Corporation and its purpose is to
engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized
under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ").

 

 _FOURTH_ : The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation shall
have authority to issue is 1,100,000,000 consisting of ( _x_ ) 1,000,000,000

one or more series as hereinafter provided.

 

1\. _Provisions Relating to the Common Stock_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or by the DGCL, each holder of shares of Common Stock shall be
entitled, with respect to each share of Common Stock held by such holder, to
one vote in person or by proxy on all matters submitted to a vote of the
holders of Common Stock, whether voting separately as a class or otherwise.

(b) Subject to the preferences and rights, if any, applicable to shares of
Preferred Stock or any series thereof, the holders of shares of Common Stock
shall be entitled to receive such dividends and other distributions in cash,
property, stock or otherwise as may be declared thereon by the Board of
Directors at any time and from time to time out of assets or funds of the
Corporation legally available therefor and shall share equally on a per share
basis in such dividends and distributions.

 

(c) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up of the Corporation, after payment or provision for payment of the
debts and other liabilities of the Corporation, and subject to the preferences
and rights, if any, applicable to shares of Preferred Stock or any series
thereof, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive
all of  the remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its

2\. _Provisions Relating to the Preferred Stock_.

 

(a) The terms of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be set forth on Exhibit
A to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

(b) One or more additional series of Preferred Stock may be issued at any time
and from time to time. The Board of Directors is hereby authorized to provide
for the issuance of shares out of unissued shares of Preferred Stock that have
not been designated as a series in one or more additional series and, by
resolution and by filing a certificate of designation pursuant to the
applicable provisions of the DGCL (hereinafter referred to as a " _Preferred
Stock Certificate of Designation_ "), to establish from time to time the
number of shares to be included in each such series, and to fix the
designation, powers, preferences and the relative participating, optional or
other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions
thereof, of shares of each such series, including, without limitation,
dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of
redemption and liquidation preferences. The powers, preferences and relative,

may be different from those of any and all other series at any time
outstanding.

 

(c) The Common Stock shall be subject to the express terms of the Preferred
Stock and any series thereof.

 

(d) Except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock, as such,
shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation including any Preferred Stock Certificate of
Designation that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series
of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled,
either separately or together with the holders of one or more other series of
Preferred Stock, to vote thereon pursuant to this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation including any Preferred Stock Certificate of
Designation or pursuant to the DGCL as currently in effect or as the same may
hereafter be amended.

3\. _Voting in Election of Directors_. Except as may be required by the DGCL
or as provided in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
including any Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation, holders of Common
Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors
and for all other purposes, and holders of Preferred Stock shall not be
entitled to vote on any matter or receive notice of any meeting of
stockholders. _FIFTH_ : The following provisions are inserted for the management of the
business, for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation and for the
purpose of creating, defining, limiting and regulating the powers of the
Corporation and its directors and stockholders:

 

1\. Except as may otherwise be provided by law, this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws of the Corporation, the business
and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of
the Board of Directors.

 

2\. Subject to any rights granted to the holders of shares of any class or
series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, the number of directors of the
Corporation shall be fixed, and may be altered from time to time, exclusively
by resolution of the Board of Directors, but in no event may the number of
directors of the Corporation be less than one.

 

3\. Subject to any rights granted to the holders of shares of any class or
series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, a director may be removed from
office only for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock then entitled to
vote in an election of directors.

 

4\. Subject to any rights granted to the holders of shares of any class or
series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, and except as otherwise provided
by law, any vacancy in the Board of Directors that results from an increase in
the number of directors, from the death, disability, resignation,
disqualification or removal of any director or from any other cause shall be
filled solely by an affirmative vote of at least a majority of the directors
then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. A
director elected to fill a vacancy or a newly created directorship shall hold
office until the next election of the class for which such director shall
have been chosen and until his or her successor has been elected and qualified
or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal.

 

5\. No director of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of his or her fiduciary duty as
a director, except that such directors may be liable ( _i_ ) for breach of the
directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, ( _ii_ )
for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional
misconduct or a knowing violation of law, ( _iii_ ) under Section 174 of the
DGCL, or ( _iv_ ) for any transaction from which the director derived an
improper personal benefit. Any amendment, modification or repeal of
this Section 5 shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a
director of the Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission
occurring prior to the time of such amendment, modification or repeal.

 

6\. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, the Corporation shall
indemnify and advance expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines
and  amounts paid in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred, to each person
who is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that

senior to the Series A-1 Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, Holders
shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of
Directors and to the extent lawful, cumulative dividends at a rate per year of
5.250% of the Initial Liquidation Preference (equivalent to $5.25 per year per
share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock), payable in cash, by delivery of shares
of Common Stock or by delivery of any combination of cash and shares of Common
Stock, as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion (subject to the
limitations described in Section 4). Declared dividends on the Series A-1
Preferred Stock shall be payable quarterly on each Dividend Payment Date at
such annual rate, and dividends shall accumulate from the most recent date as
to which dividends shall have been paid or, if no dividends have been paid,
from the Initial Issue Date, whether or not declared or in any Dividend Period
or Dividend Periods, as the case may be, there have been funds or shares of
Common Stock legally available for the payment of such dividends. Dividends
will be payable on a Dividend Payment Date to Holders that are Record Holders
on the Regular Record Date immediately preceding such Dividend Payment Date,
but only to the extent a dividend has been declared to be payable on
such Dividend Payment Date, except that dividends payable on the Mandatory
Conversion Date will be payable to the Holders

 



10  presenting the Series A-1 Preferred Stock for conversion. If any Dividend
Payment Date is not a Business Day, the dividend payable on such date shall be
paid on the next Business Day without any adjustment, interest or other
penalty in respect of such delay. Dividends payable on shares of Series A-1
Preferred Stock for each full Dividend Period shall be computed by dividing
the annual dividend rate by four. Dividends payable on shares of Series A-1
Preferred Stock for any period other than a full Dividend Period shall be
based on the number of days elapsed during such Dividend Period and computed
on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
Accumulated dividends on shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall not bear
interest if they are paid subsequent to the applicable Dividend Payment Date.

 

(b) No dividend shall be declared or paid upon, or any sum set apart for the
payment of dividends upon, any outstanding share of the Series A-1 Preferred
Stock with respect to any Dividend Period unless all dividends for all
preceding Dividend Periods shall have been declared and paid, or declared and
a sufficient sum has been set apart for the payment of such dividends, upon
all outstanding shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock. No dividend shall be
paid unless and until the Board of Directors declares a dividend payable with
respect to the Series A-1 Preferred Stock.

 

(c) Holders shall not be entitled to any dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred
Stock, whether payable in cash, shares of Common Stock or any combination
thereof, in excess of full cumulative dividends.

(d)

 

(i) So long as any share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock remains outstanding:

 

(A) no dividend or distribution shall be declared or paid on the Common Stock
or any other shares of Junior Stock, except dividends payable solely in
shares of Common Stock;

(B) no dividend or distribution shall be declared or paid on Parity Stock,
except as set forth in this Section 3(d); and

(C) no Common Stock, Junior Stock or Parity Stock shall be, directly or
indirectly, purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries,

 

unless all accrued and unpaid dividends for all past Dividend Periods,
including the latest completed Dividend Period, on all outstanding shares of
Series A-1 Preferred Stock have been or are contemporaneously declared and
paid in full (or have been declared and a sum sufficient for the payment
thereof has been set aside for the benefit of the Holders on the
applicable Regular Record Date).

(ii) The limitations set forth in Section 3(d)(i) shall not apply to:

 

(A) redemptions, purchases or other acquisitions of shares of Common Stock or
other Junior Stock in connection with the administration of any

 



11  employee benefit plan in the ordinary course of business (including
purchases of shares of Common Stock in lieu of tax withholding and purchases
of shares of Common Stock to offset the Share Dilution Amount pursuant to a
publicly announced repurchase plan); provided that any purchases to offset the
Share Dilution Amount shall in no event exceed the Share Dilution Amount;

 

(B) any dividends or distributions of rights or Junior Stock in connection
with a stockholders rights plan or any redemption or repurchase of rights
pursuant to any stockholders rights plan;

(C) the acquisition by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries of record
ownership in Junior Stock or Parity Stock for the beneficial ownership of any
other Persons (other than for the beneficial ownership by the Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries), including as trustees or custodians; and

(D) the exchange or conversion of Junior Stock for or into other Junior Stock
or of Parity Stock for or into other Parity Stock (with the same or lesser
aggregate liquidation preference) or Junior Stock and, in each case, the
payment of cash solely in lieu of fractional shares.

 

When dividends are not paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment
thereof set aside for the benefit of the Holders thereof on the applicable
Regular Record Date) on any Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity
Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates,
on a dividend payment date falling within a Dividend Period related to
such Dividend Payment Date) in full upon the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and
any shares of Parity Stock, all dividends declared on Series A-1 Preferred
Stock and all such Parity Stock and payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or,
in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the
Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within the Dividend
Period related to such Dividend Payment Date) shall be declared and paid pro
rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends declared shall bear the
same ratio to each other as all accrued and unpaid dividends per share on the
shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock and all Parity Stock payable on such
Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend
payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment
date falling within the Dividend Period related to such Dividend Payment Date)
(subject to their having been declared by the Board of Directors out of funds
of the Corporation lawfully available and including, in the case of Parity
Stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued but unpaid dividends) bear
to each other. If the Board of Directors determines not to pay any dividend or
a full dividend on a Dividend Payment Date, the Corporation will provide a 10
Business Days written notice to the Holders prior to such Dividend Payment
Date.

 

Subject to the foregoing, dividends (payable in cash, securities or other
property) as may be determined by the Board of Directors may be declared and
paid on any securities of the Corporation, including Common Stock and other
Junior Stock, from time to time out of any funds of the Corporation lawfully
available for such payment, and Holders shall not be entitled to participate
in any such dividends.

 



12 Section 4. Method of Payment of Dividends.

 

(a) Subject to the limitations described below, any declared dividend (or any
portion of any declared dividend) on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, whether
or not for a current Dividend Period or any prior Dividend Period, including
in connection with the payment of declared and unpaid dividends, may be paid
by the Corporation, as determined in the Corporations sole discretion: 

(i) in cash;

 

(ii) by delivery of shares of Common Stock; or

 

(iii) by delivery, of any combination of cash and shares of Common Stock;

 

 _provided_ that in the case of a Fundamental Change Conversion that is a
Reorganization Event, dividends otherwise payable in shares of Common Stock
may be paid by delivery of Units of Exchange Property in accordance with
Section 11(e); and provided further that if the Board of Directors may not
lawfully authorize payment of all or any portion of such accrued and unpaid
dividends in cash, it shall authorize payment of such dividends in shares of
Common Stock or Units of Exchange Property, as the case may be, if lawfully
permitted to do so.

 

(b) Each payment of a declared dividend on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock
shall be made in cash, except to the extent the Corporation timely elects to
make all or any portion of such payment in shares of Common Stock. The
Corporation shall give notice to Holders of any such election and the portions
of such payment that will be made in cash and in shares of Common Stock no
later than 10 Scheduled Trading Days prior to the Dividend Payment Date for
such dividend; provided that if the Corporation does not provide timely notice
of such election, the Corporation will be deemed to have elected to pay the
relevant dividend in cash.

 

(c) If the Corporation elects to pay any dividend or portion thereof in shares
of Common Stock, such shares of Common Stock shall be valued for such purpose
at 97% of the Average VWAP per Common Share over the five consecutive Trading
Day period beginning on and including the seventh Scheduled Trading Day prior
to the applicable Dividend Payment Date (the "Average Price"). 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the number of shares of
Common Stock to be delivered, in connection with any declared dividend on the
Series A-1 Preferred Stock, including any dividend payable in connection with
a conversion, exceed a number equal to the total dividend payment divided by
$15.75, subject to adjustment in a manner inversely proportional to any
adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 11 (such
dollar amount, as adjusted from time to time, the "Floor Price"). To the
extent that the amount of any declared dividend exceeds the product of (x) the
number of shares of Common Stock delivered in connection with such declared
dividend and (y) 97% of the Average Price, the Corporation shall, if it is
legally able to do so, notwithstanding any notice by the Corporation to the
contrary, pay such excess amount in cash.

(e) To the extent that the Corporation, in its reasonable judgment, determines
that a Shelf Registration Statement is required in connection with the
issuance of, or for resales of,

 



13  shares of Common Stock issued as payment of a dividend on the Series A-1
Preferred Stock, including dividends paid in connection with a conversion, the
Corporation shall, to the extent such a Shelf Registration Statement is not
currently filed and effective, use its commercially reasonable efforts to file
and maintain the effectiveness of such a Shelf Registration Statement until
the earlier of such time as all such shares of Common Stock have been resold
thereunder and such time as all such shares would be freely tradable without
registration by holders thereof that are not "affiliates" of the Corporation
for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. To the extent
applicable, the Corporation shall also use its commercially reasonable efforts
to have such shares of Common Stock qualified or registered under applicable
state securities laws, if required, and approved for listing on the New York
Stock Exchange (or if the shares of Common Stock are not then listed on the
New York Stock Exchange, on the principal other U.S. national or regional
securities exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are then listed).

 

(f) In respect of any cash paid, shares of Common Stock issued or Units of
Exchange Property delivered in payment or partial payment of a dividend to a
Non-U.S. Holder, the Corporation shall withhold and, in the case of such
shares of Common Stock or Units of Exchange Property, the Corporation may do
so by selling (or directing the Transfer Agent or any paying agent on behalf
of the Corporation to withhold and sell) such amount in cash, number of
shares of Common Stock or Units of Exchange Property as the Corporation deems
necessary, to result in proceeds from such sale (after deduction of customary
commissions, which shall be for the account of such Non-U.S. Holder) to pay
all or any part of any U.S. withholding tax obligation that the Corporation
has (as determined by it in its sole discretion) in respect of the payment or
partial payment of such dividend of cash, shares of Common Stock or Units of
Exchange Property to such Non-U.S. Holder.

Section 5. Mandatory Conversion on the Mandatory Conversion Date.

(a) Each outstanding share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall automatically
convert on the Mandatory Conversion Date into a number of shares of Common
Stock equal to the Conversion Rate, unless such share of Series A-1 Preferred
Stock has been converted prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date in the manner
described in Section 6 or Section 7; provided that if the
Mandatory Conversion Date is not a Business Day, the Mandatory Conversion
Date shall be postponed to the following Business Day; provided further, that
if the Applicable Market Value is first determinable on a date later than the
Mandatory Conversion Date because there are one or more Scheduled Trading
Days that are not Trading Days during the 20 consecutive Scheduled Trading Day
period commencing on and including the 22nd Scheduled Trading Day prior to the
Mandatory Conversion Date, the Mandatory Conversion Date shall be postponed
to such later date.

(b) Each of the Fixed Conversion Rates, the Initial Price, the
Threshold Appreciation Price, the Floor Price, the Fundamental Change Date,
and the Applicable Market Value shall be subject to adjustment in accordance
with the provisions of Section 11.

 

(c) If prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date the Corporation has not declared
all or any portion of the accumulated dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred
Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that Holders receive an
additional number of shares of Common Stock equal

 



14  to the amount of accumulated dividends that have not been declared (the
"Additional Conversion Amount") divided by the greater of the Floor Price and
97% of the Average Price. To the extent that the Additional Conversion Amount
exceeds the product of such number of additional shares of Common Stock and
97% of the Average Price, the Corporation shall, if the Corporation is legally
able to do so, declare and pay such excess amount in cash pro rata to the
Holders.

Section 6. Optional Conversion at the Option of the Holder.

 

(a) Holders shall have the right to convert their shares of Series A-1
Preferred Stock, in whole or in part (but in no event less than one share
Series A-1 Preferred Stock) (any conversion pursuant to this Section 6, an
"Optional Conversion"), at any time prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date,
other than during the Fundamental Change Conversion Period, into shares of
Common Stock at the Minimum Conversion Rate, subject to adjustment in
accordance with Section 11.

(b) If as of any Optional Conversion Date the Corporation has not declared
all or any portion of the accumulated and unpaid dividends for all full
Dividend Periods ending on a Dividend Payment Date prior to such Optional
Conversion Date, the Minimum Conversion Rate shall be adjusted, with respect
to the relevant Optional Conversion, so that the converting Holder receives an
additional number of shares of Common Stock equal to the amount of accumulated
and unpaid dividends that have not been declared for such full Dividend
Periods (the "Optional Conversion Additional Conversion Amount"), divided by
the greater of the Floor Price and the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock
over the 20 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the
22nd Trading Day prior to the Optional Conversion Date (such average being
referred to as the "Optional Conversion Average Price"). To the extent that
the Optional Conversion Additional Conversion Amount exceeds the product of
the number of additional shares and the Optional Conversion Average Price,
the Corporation will not have any obligation to pay the shortfall in cash.
Except as described in the first sentence of this Section 6(b), upon any
Optional Conversion of any shares of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, the
Corporation shall make no payment or allowance for undeclared dividends on
such shares of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, unless such Optional Conversion
occurs after the Record Date for a declared dividend and on or prior to the
immediately succeeding Dividend Payment Date, in which case the Corporation
shall pay such dividend on such Dividend Payment Date to the Record Holder of
the converted shares as of such Record Date, in accordance with Section 3.

 

(c) To effect an Optional Conversion, the converting Holder shall comply with
the applicable conversion procedures set forth in Section 8. The Corporation
shall, in accordance with the instructions provided by the Holder thereof in
the written notice of conversion provided to the Corporation pursuant to
Section 8, deliver to the Holder the whole number of shares of Common Stock to
which the converting Holder shall be entitled upon such Optional Conversion,
together with payment of cash in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common
Stock, as provided in Section 10, and any certificate or certificates, as the
case may be, representing shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, as provided
in Section 8(d)(i). Such delivery shall take place on the third Business Day
succeeding the Optional Conversion Date. If applicable, the Corporation shall
instruct the Transfer Agent to register the whole number of shares of Common
Stock to which the converting Holder shall be entitled upon such Optional
Conversion in the name or names, as the case may be, specified by such Holder
in the notice of conversion.

 



15 Section 7. Fundamental Change Conversion.

 

(a) If a Fundamental Change occurs on or prior to the Mandatory Conversion
Date, Holders, subject to adjustments in accordance with Section 11, shall
have the right to:

(i) convert their Series A-1 Preferred Stock, in whole or in part (but in no
event less than one Series A-1 Preferred Stock) (any such conversion pursuant
to this Section 7 being a "Fundamental Change Conversion") at any time during
the period (the "Fundamental Change Conversion Period") from and including the
Effective Date of such Fundamental Change to, but excluding, the earlier of
(i) the Mandatory Conversion Date and (ii) the date that is 30 calendar days
after the Effective Date (any conversion pursuant to this Section 7, a
"Fundamental Change Conversion") (1) into a number of shares of Common Stock
equal to the Fundamental Change Conversion Rate per share of Series A-1
Preferred Stock; or (2) if the Fundamental Change also constitutes a
Reorganization Event, Units of Exchange Property in accordance with Section
11(e), based on the Fundamental Change Conversion Rate;

(ii) with respect to such converted shares, receive a Fundamental Change
Dividend Make-whole Amount payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock; and

 

(iii) with respect to such converted shares, receive the Accumulated Dividend
Amount payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock;

subject, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to the Corporations right to
deliver shares of Common Stock in lieu of all or part of such amounts as set
forth in Section 7(d). Such delivery shall take place on the third Business
Day following the applicable Fundamental Change Conversion Date.

 

Notwithstanding clauses (ii) and (iii), if such Effective Date or the relevant
Fundamental Change Conversion Date falls during a Dividend Period for which
the Corporation declared a dividend, the Corporation shall pay such dividend
on such Dividend Payment Date to the Record Holders as of such Record Date, in
accordance with Section 3, and such dividend shall not be included in
the Accumulated Dividend Amount, and the Fundamental Change Dividend Make-
whole Amount shall not include the present value of such dividend.

 

(b) To the extent practicable, at least 20 calendar days prior to the
anticipated Effective Date of the Fundamental Change, but in any event not
later than two Business Days following the Corporations becoming aware of the
occurrence of a Fundamental Change, a written notice shall be sent by or on
behalf of the Corporation, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the
Record Holders. Such notice shall contain:

(i) the date on which the Fundamental Change is anticipated to be effected;

 

(ii) the Fundamental Change Conversion Period;

 

(iii) the instructions a Holder must follow to effect a Fundamental Change
Conversion in connection with such Fundamental Change; and

(iv) whether the Corporation has elected to pay all or any portion of accrued
and unpaid dividends in shares of Common Stock or Units of Exchange Property,
as the case may be, and, if so, the portion thereof (as a percentage) that
will be paid in shares of Common Stock or Units of Exchange Property.

 



16 (c) To effect a Fundamental Change Conversion, the converting Holder must
submit its Series A-1 Preferred Stock for conversion and comply with the
applicable conversion procedures set forth in Section 8 at any time during the
Fundamental Change Conversion Period. Holders who do not submit Series A-1
Preferred Stock for conversion during the Fundamental Change Conversion
Period will not be entitled to convert their Series A-1 Preferred Stock at the
Fundamental Change Conversion Rate or to receive the Fundamental Change
Dividend Make-whole Amount or the Accumulated Dividend Amount. To the extent
a Holder does not convert its shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock pursuant to
this Section 7 and a Reorganization Event has occurred, in lieu of shares of
Common Stock, the Corporation shall pay or deliver, as the case may be, to
such Holder on the Mandatory Conversion Date, Units of Exchange Property as
determined in accordance with Section 11(e).

(d)

 

(i) For any shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock that are converted during the
Fundamental Change Conversion Period, in addition to the shares of Common
Stock issued upon conversion at the Fundamental Change Conversion Rate, the
Corporation will at its option:

 

(A) pay the Holder in cash, to the extent the Corporation is legally permitted
to do so, the present value, computed using a discount rate of 5.250% per
year, of all dividend payments on the Holders Series A-1 Preferred Stock for
all the remaining Dividend Periods (excluding any accumulated and unpaid
dividends for all Dividend Periods ending on or prior to the Dividend Payment
Date preceding the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change as well as
dividends accumulated to the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change) from
such Effective Date to but excluding the Mandatory Conversion Date
(the "Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole Amount");

(B) increase the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued on conversion
by a number equal to (x) the Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole Amount
divided by (y) the greater of the Floor Price and 97% of the Stock Price, or

 

(C) pay the Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole Amount in a combination of
cash and shares of Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of clauses
(A) and (B) above.

(ii) In addition, for any Series A-1 Preferred Stock that are
converted during the Fundamental Change Conversion Period, to the extent
that, as of the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change, the Corporation has
not declared any or all of the accumulated dividends on the Series A-1
Preferred Stock as of such Effective Date (including

 



17  accumulated and unpaid dividends for all dividend periods ending on or prior
to the Dividend Payment Date preceding the Effective Date of the Fundamental
Change as well as dividends accumulated to the Effective Date of the
Fundamental Change, the "Accumulated Dividend Amount"), Holders who convert
Series A-1 Preferred Stock within the Fundamental Change Conversion Period
will be entitled to receive such Accumulated Dividend Amount upon conversion.
The Accumulated Dividend Amount will be payable at the Corporations election
in either:

(A) cash, to the extent the Corporation is legally permitted to do so,

(B) an additional number of shares of Common Stock equal to (x) the
Accumulated Dividend Amount divided by (y) the greater of the Floor Price and
97% of the Stock Price, or

 

(C) a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock.

 

(iii) The Corporation shall pay the Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole
Amount and the Accumulated Dividend Amount in cash, except to the extent the
Corporation elects on or prior to the second Business Day following the
Effective Date of a Fundamental Change to make all or any portion of such
payments in shares of Common Stock. If the Corporation elects to
deliver shares of Common Stock in respect of all or any portion of the
Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole Amount or Accumulated Dividend Amount,
to the extent that the Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole Amount or the
Accumulated Dividend Amount or any portion thereof paid in shares of Common
Stock exceeds the product of the number of additional shares the Corporation
delivers in respect thereof and 97% of the Stock Price, the Corporation shall,
if it is legally able to do so, declare and pay such excess amount in cash.

(e) Not later than the second Business Day following the Effective Date, the
Corporation shall notify Holders of:

(i) the Fundamental Change Conversion Rate;

 

(ii) the Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole Amount and whether the
Corporation will pay such amount in cash, shares of Common Stock or a
combination thereof, and specifying the combination thereof, if applicable;
and

(iii) the Accumulated Dividend Amount as of the Effective Date and whether
the Corporation will pay such amount in cash, shares of Common Stock or a
combination thereof, and if applicable, specifying the combination thereof, if
applicable.

 

Section 8. Conversion Procedures.

 

(a) On the Mandatory Conversion Date, any Fundamental Change Conversion Date
or any Optional Conversion Date (each, a "Conversion Date"), dividends on any
shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock converted to Common Stock shall cease to
accrue and cumulate, and on the Mandatory Conversion Date (subject to
postponement as described in Section 5(a)), such converted shares of Series
A-1 Preferred Stock shall cease to be outstanding, in each case,

 



18  subject to the right of Holders of such shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock
to receive shares of Common Stock (or Units of Exchange Property, if
applicable) into which such shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock were
converted and any accrued and unpaid dividends on such shares to which such
Holders are otherwise entitled pursuant to Section 5(c), Section 6(b) or
Section 7(d), as applicable.

 

(b) Subject to postponement as described in Section 5(a), on the Mandatory
Conversion Date, pursuant to Section 5, any outstanding shares of Series A-1
Preferred Stock shall automatically convert into shares of Common Stock. The
Person or Persons entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon any such
conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be treated as the record
holder or record holders, as the case may be, of such shares of Common Stock
as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable Conversion Date. Except
as provided under Section 11, prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on such
applicable Conversion Date, shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of any shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall not be outstanding for any
purpose, and Holders of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall have no
rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock, including, without
limitation, voting rights, rights to respond to tender offers for the Common
Stock and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the Common
Stock, by virtue of holding shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock. No
allowance or adjustment, except as set forth in Section 11, shall be made in
respect of dividends payable to holders of record of Common Stock as of any
date prior to such applicable Conversion Date.

 

(c) To effect an Optional Conversion pursuant to Section 6 or a Fundamental
Change Conversion pursuant to Section 7, a Holder who

 

(i) holds a beneficial interest in a Global Preferred Share must deliver to
DTC the appropriate instruction form for conversion pursuant to DTCs
conversion program and, if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes or
duties, if any; or

(ii) holds Series A-1 Preferred Stock in definitive, certificated form must:

(A) complete and manually sign the conversion notice on the back of the
Series A-1 Preferred Stock certificate or a facsimile of such conversion
notice;

(B) deliver the completed conversion notice and the certificated Series A-1
Preferred Stock to be converted to the Conversion and Dividend Disbursing
Agent;

 

(C) if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents; and

 

(D) if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes or duties, if any.

 

(the day on which the Holder complies with such requirements, the "Optional
Conversion Date" or the "Fundamental Change Conversion Date", as the case may
be); provided that, the Fundamental Change Conversion Date shall be a date no
earlier than the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change and no later than
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last day of the Fundamental
Change Conversion Period.

 



19 The issuance by the Corporation of shares of Common Stock upon an Optional
Conversion shall be deemed effective immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New York
City time, on the Optional Conversion Date.

(d) With respect to any Optional Conversion or any Fundamental Change
Conversion of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock:

(i) if there shall have been surrendered certificate or certificates, as the
case may be, representing a greater number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred
Stock than the number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock to be converted,
the Corporation shall execute and the Registrar shall countersign and deliver
to such Holder or such Holders designee, at the expense of the Corporation,
new certificate or certificates, as the case may be, representing the number
of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock that shall not have been converted;
and

(ii) if the shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock converted are held in book-
entry form through the facilities of the Depositary, promptly following the
relevant Optional Conversion Date or Fundamental Change Conversion Date, as
the case may be, the Corporation shall cause the Transfer Agent and Registrar
to reduce the number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock represented by
the global certificate by making a notation on Schedule I attached to the
relevant Global Preferred Share.

 

Section 9. Reservation of Common Stock.

 

(a) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its
authorized and unissued shares of Common stock, solely for issuance, the full
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon payment of accrued and unpaid
dividends and upon conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock at the Maximum
Conversion Rate then in effect.

 

(b) All shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Series A-1
Preferred Stock shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable, free and clear of all liens, claims, charges, security interests
and other encumbrances (other than liens, claims, charges, security interests
and other encumbrances created by the Holders).

 

(c) Prior to the delivery of any securities that the Corporation shall be
obligated to deliver upon conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, the
Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all federal
and state laws and regulations thereunder, if any, requiring the registration
of such securities with, or any approval of or consent to the delivery
thereof by, any governmental authority.

(d) The Corporation hereby covenants and agrees that, if at any time the
Common Stock shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or any other
national securities exchange or automated quotation system, the Corporation
shall, if permitted by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation
system, list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed
on such exchange or automated quotation system, all Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and payment of dividends thereon,
if any; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the rules of such exchange or
automated quotation system permit the

 



20  Corporation to defer the listing of such Common Stock until the first
conversion of Series A-1 Preferred Stock into Common Stock in accordance with
the provisions hereof, the Corporation covenants to list such Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock in accordance with
the requirements of such exchange or automated quotation system at such time.

 

Section 10. Fractional Shares.

 

(a) No fractional shares of Common Stock or any other common stock or ADRs
included in the Exchange Property shall be issued to Holders, including as a
result of any conversion of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock or as a
result of any payment of dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock in shares
of Common Stock or Units of Exchange Property.

 

(b) In lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock or any other common stock
or ADRs included in the Exchange Property otherwise issuable upon Mandatory
Conversion, Optional Conversion or Fundamental Change Conversion (including in
connection with a dividend payment), that Holder shall be entitled to receive
an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) based on the VWAP per
share of Common Stock, or, if applicable, such other common stock or ADR, on
the Trading Day immediately preceding the applicable Conversion Date.

 

(c) If more than one share of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock is surrendered
for conversion at one time by or for the same Holder, the number of full
shares of Common Stock, or, if applicable, other common stock or full ADRs,
issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the
aggregate number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock so surrendered for
conversion. If the Corporation pays dividends in Common Stock, other common
stock or ADRs pursuant to Section 4(b) on more than one share of Series A-1
Preferred Stock held at any one time by or for the same Holder, the number of
full shares of Common Stock, or, if applicable, other common stock or full
ADRs, payable in connection with such dividend shall be computed on the basis
of the aggregate number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock so surrendered
for conversion.

 

Section 11. Conversion Rate Adjustments to the Fixed Conversion Rates.

 

(a) Each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time as follows:

 

(i) If the Corporation issues Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to
all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, or if the Corporation
effects a subdivision or combination (including, without limitation, a stock
split or a reverse stock split) of the Common Stock, each Fixed Conversion
Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:

 



   ![LOGO](g214152stp026.jpg) 

where,

 



21 CR0 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution or
immediately prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the effective date for
such subdivision or combination, as the case may be;

 

CR1 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately after 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on such Record Date or immediately after 9:00 a.m., New York
City time, on such effective date, as the case may be;

OS0 = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Record Date or immediately prior to
9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such effective date, as the case may be
(and prior to giving effect to such event); and

OS1 = the number of shares of Common Stock that would be outstanding
immediately after, and solely as a result of, such dividend, distribution,
subdivision or combination.

 

Any adjustment made under this Section 11(a)(i) shall become effective
immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date for such
dividend or distribution, or immediately after 9:00 a.m., New York City time,
on the effective date for such subdivision or combination, as the case may be.
If any dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination of the type
described in this clause (i) is declared but not so paid or made, each Fixed
Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the earlier
of (a) the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay or make such
dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination and (b) the date the
dividend or distribution was to be paid or the date the subdivision or
combination was to have been effective, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that
would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, subdivision
or combination had not been declared.

(ii) If the Corporation issues to all or substantially all holders of the
Common Stock any rights (other than pursuant to any stockholder rights plan),
options or warrants entitling them for a period expiring 60 days or less from
the date of issuance of such rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or
purchase shares of Common Stock at less than the Average VWAP per share of
Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and
including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement for
such issuance, each Fixed Conversion Rate will be increased based on the
following formula:



   ![LOGO](g214152stp027.jpg) 

where,

CR0 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the Record Date for such issuance;

 

CR1 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately after 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on such Record Date;

 



22 OS0 = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Record Date;

X = the number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights,
options or warrants; and

Y = the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, options or
warrants, divided by the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock for the 10
consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day
immediately preceding the date of announcement for such issuance.

 

Any increase in the Fixed Conversion Rates made pursuant to this Section
11(a)(ii) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, on the Record Date for such issuance. To the extent such rights, options
or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or termination, each
Fixed Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date of
such expiration or termination, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then
be in effect had the increase with respect to the issuance of such rights,
options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of
shares of Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights, options or
warrants are not so issued, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be decreased,
effective as of the earlier of (a) the date the Board of Directors determines
not to issue such rights, options or warrants and (b) the date such rights,
options or warrants were to have been issued, to the Fixed Conversion Rate
that would then be in effect if such issuance had not been announced.

 

For purposes of this Section 11(a)(ii), in determining whether any rights,
options or warrants entitle the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase
shares of the Common Stock at less than the Average VWAP per share of Common
Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the
Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement for such issuance,
and in determining the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights,
options or warrants, there shall be taken into account any consideration the
Corporation receives for such rights, options or warrants and any amount
payable on exercise thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other
than cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(iii) If the Corporation pays a dividend or other distribution to all or
substantially all holders of Common Stock of shares of the Corporations
capital stock (other than Common Stock), evidences of the Corporations
indebtedness, the Corporations assets or rights to acquire the capital
stock, indebtedness or assets of the Corporation, excluding:

(1) any dividend, distribution or issuance as to which an adjustment was
effected pursuant to Section 11(a)(i) or Section 11(a)(ii);

(2) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash as to which an
adjustment was effected pursuant to Section 11(a)(iv) below;

(3) Spin-Offs as to which the provisions set forth below in this Section
11(a)(iii) apply; and

(4) any dividends or distributions in connection with a Reorganization Event
that is included in Exchange Property under Section 11(e),

 



23 then each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following
formula:

 



   ![LOGO](g214152stp029.jpg) 

where,

CR0 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution;

 

CR1 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately after 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on such Record Date;

SP0 = the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive
Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately
preceding the Record Date for such dividend or distribution; and

 

FMV = the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors) on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution of shares of
the Corporations capital stock (other than Common Stock), evidences of the
Corporations indebtedness, the Corporations assets or rights to acquire the
capital stock, indebtedness or assets of the Corporation, expressed as an
amount per share of Common Stock.

If the Board of Directors determines the "FMV" (as defined in this Section
11(a)(iii)) of any dividend or other distribution for purposes of this Section
11(a)(iii) by referring to the actual or when-issued trading market for any
securities, it shall in doing so consider the prices in such market over
the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day
period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the
Record Date for such dividend or distribution.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "FMV" (as defined in this Section
11(a)(iii)) is equal to or greater than "SP0" (as defined in this Section
11(a)(iii)), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder shall receive, in
respect of each share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, at the same time and upon
the same terms as holders of Common Stock, the amount and kind of shares of
the Corporations capital stock (other than Common Stock), evidences of the
Corporations indebtedness, the Corporations assets or rights to acquire the
capital stock, indebtedness or assets of the Corporation that such Holder
would have received if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock
equal to the Maximum Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to 5:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on the Record Date for such dividend or other
distribution.

Any increase made under the portion of this Section 11(a)(iii) above
shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
the Record Date for such dividend or other distribution. If such dividend or
distribution is not so paid or made, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be
decreased, effective as of the earlier of (a) the date the Board of Directors
determines not to pay the dividend or other distribution and (b) the date such
dividend or distribution was to have been paid, to the Fixed Conversion Rate
that would then be in effect if the dividend or other distribution had not
been declared.

 



24 If the transaction that gives rise to an adjustment pursuant to this Section
11(a)(iii) is one pursuant to which the payment of a dividend or other
distribution on the Common Stock consists of shares of capital stock of, or
similar equity interests in, a Subsidiary or other business unit of the
Corporation (a "Spin-Off) that are, or, when issued, will be, traded on a
U.S. national securities exchange or a reasonably comparable non-U.S.
equivalent, then each Fixed Conversion Rate shall instead be increased based
on the following formula:

 



   ![LOGO](g214152stp030.jpg) 

where,

CR0 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Ex-Dividend
Date for such dividend or distribution;

 

CR1 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately after 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and
including, the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution;

FMV0 = the Average VWAP per share of such capital stock or similar equity
interests distributed to holders of the Common Stock applicable to one share
of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and
including, the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution; and

MP0 = the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive
Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date for such
dividend or distribution.

 

The adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate under the immediately preceding
paragraph shall occur at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the 10th
consecutive Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Ex-Dividend
Date for such dividend or distribution, but will be given effect as of 9:00
a.m., New York City time, on the date immediately following the Record Date
for such dividend or distribution. The Corporation shall delay the settlement
of any conversion of shares of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock if the
Conversion Date occurs after the Record Date for such dividend or distribution
and prior to the end of such 10 consecutive Trading Day period. In such
event, the Corporation shall deliver the shares of Common Stock issuable in
respect of such conversion (based on the adjusted Fixed Conversion Rates as
described above) on the first Business Day immediately following the last
Trading Day of such 10 consecutive Trading Day period.

For purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii) (and subject in all respects to
Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii)):

(A) rights, options or warrants distributed by the Corporation to all or
substantially all holders of the Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for
or purchase shares

 



25  of the Corporations capital stock, including Common Stock (either initially
or under certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until the
occurrence of a specified event or events ("Trigger Event"):

(i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of the Common Stock;

 

(ii) are not exercisable; and

 

(iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of the Common Stock,
shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section
11(a)(iii) (and no adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates under this Section
11(a)(iii) shall be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger
Event, whereupon such rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to have
been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the
Fixed Conversion Rates shall be made under this Section 11(a)(iii).

 

(B) If any such right, option or warrant, including any such existing rights,
options or warrants distributed prior to the Issue Date, are subject to
events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, options or warrants become
exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or
other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall
be deemed to be the date of distribution and Record Date with respect to new
rights, options or warrants with such rights (in which case the existing
rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to terminate and expire on such
date without exercise by any of the holders thereof).

(C) In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of
rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type
described in the immediately preceding clause (B)) with respect thereto that
was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an
adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates under this clause (iii) was made:

(1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have
been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, upon
such final redemption or repurchase (x) the Fixed Conversion Rates shall be
readjusted as if such rights, options or warrants had not been issued and (y)
the Fixed Conversion Rates shall then again be readjusted to give effect to
such distribution, deemed distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be,
as though it were a cash distribution pursuant to Section 11(a)(iv), equal to
the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders
of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming
such holder had retained such rights, options or warrants), made to all
holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase; and

 

(2) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall have expired or
been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Fixed Conversion
Rates shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been
issued.

For purposes of Section 11(a)(i), Section 11(a)(ii) and this Section
11(a)(iii), if any dividend or distribution to which this Section 11(a)(iii)
is applicable includes one or both of:

 

(A) a dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock to which Section
11(a)(i)is applicable (the "Clause A Distribution"); or 

(B) an issuance of rights, options or warrants to which Section 11(a)(ii) is
applicable (the "Clause B Distribution"),

 



26 then:

 

(1) such dividend or distribution, other than the Clause A Distribution and
the Clause B Distribution, shall be deemed to be a dividend or distribution
to which this Section 11(a)(iii) is applicable (the "Clause C Distribution")
and any Fixed Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 11(a)(iii)
with respect to such Clause C Distribution shall then be made; and

 

(2) the Clause A Distribution and Clause B Distribution shall be deemed to
immediately follow the Clause C Distribution and any Fixed Conversion Rate
adjustment required by Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii) with respect
thereto shall then be made, except that, if determined by the Corporation (I)
the "Record Date" of the Clause A Distribution and the Clause B Distribution
shall be deemed to be the Record Date of the Clause C Distribution and (II)
any shares of Common Stock included in the Clause A Distribution or Clause B
Distribution shall be deemed not to be "outstanding immediately prior to
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Record Date or immediately prior to
9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such effective date" within the meaning of
Section 11(a)(i) or "outstanding immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, on such Record Date" within the meaning of Section 11(a)(ii).

(iv) If the Corporation pays a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to
all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, each Fixed Conversion
Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
       ![LOGO](g214152stp032.jpg)  |  | where, |  | 
 

CR0 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the Record Date for such distribution;

 

CR1 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately after 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the Record Date for such distribution;

SP0 = the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive
Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately
preceding the Record Date for such distribution; and

 

C = an amount of cash per share of Common Stock that the Corporation
distributes to holders of the Common Stock.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "C" (as defined in this Section 11(a)(iv))
is equal to or greater than "SP0" (as defined in this Section 11(a)(iv)), in
lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder shall receive, in respect of each
share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, at the same time and upon the same terms
as holders of shares of Common Stock, the amount of cash that such Holder
would have received if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock
equal to the Maximum Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to 5:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on the Record Date for such distribution.

 



27 Any adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates pursuant to this Section
11(a)(iv) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, on the Record Date for such distribution. If such distribution is not so
paid, the Fixed Conversion Rates shall be decreased, effective as of the
earlier of (a) the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such
dividend and (b) the date such dividend was to have been paid, to the Fixed
Conversion Rates that would then be in effect if such distribution had not
been declared.

 

(v) If the Corporation or one or more of its Subsidiaries purchases Common
Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer (except as provided in
Section 11(c)(iii)) and the cash and value of any other consideration included
in the payment per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds
the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading
Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the
last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or
exchange offer (the "Expiration Date"), each Fixed Conversion Rate shall
be increased based on the following formula:



   ![LOGO](g214152stp033.jpg) 

where,

 

CR0 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and
including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date;

CR1 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately after 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and including,
the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date;

FMV = the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors) as of the Expiration Date of the aggregate value of all cash and
any other consideration paid or payable for shares of the Common Stock validly
tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Date (the
"Purchased Shares");

 

OS1 = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the last time
tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer
(the "Expiration Time"), less any Purchased Shares;

OS0 = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the Expiration Time,
including any Purchased Shares; and

 

SP1 = the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive
Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next
succeeding the Expiration Date.

The adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate under this Section 11(a)(v)
shall occur at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the tenth consecutive Trading
Day immediately following,

 



28  and including, the Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date,
but will be given effect as of 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the
Expiration Date. The Corporation shall delay the settlement of any conversion
of Series A-1 Preferred Stock if the Conversion Date occurs during such 10
consecutive Trading Day period. In such event, the Corporation shall deliver
the shares of Common Stock issuable in respect of such conversion (based on
the adjusted Fixed Conversion Rates) on the first Business Day immediately
following the last Trading Day of such 10 consecutive Trading Day period.

 

(vi) If the Corporation has in effect a stockholder rights plan while any
shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock remain outstanding, Holders shall
receive, upon a conversion of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, in addition to
Common Stock, rights under the Corporations stockholder rights agreement
unless, prior to such conversion, the rights have expired, terminated or been
redeemed or unless the rights have separated from the Common Stock. If the
rights provided for in the stockholder rights plan have separated from the
Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable stockholder
rights agreement so that Holders would not be entitled to receive any rights
in respect of the Common Stock, if any, that the Corporation is required to
deliver upon conversion of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, each Fixed Conversion
Rate shall be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Corporation had
distributed to all holders of the Common Stock, capital stock (other than
Common Stock), evidences of the Corporations indebtedness, the Corporations
assets or rights to acquire the capital stock, indebtedness or assets of the
Corporation pursuant to Section 11(a)(iii) above, subject to readjustment upon
the subsequent expiration, termination or redemption of the rights. A
distribution of rights pursuant to a stockholder rights plan will not trigger
an adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) or
Section 11(a)(iii) above.

(b) Adjustment for Tax Reasons. The Corporation may make such increases in
each Fixed Conversion Rate, in addition to any other increases required by
this Section 11, if the Board of Directors deems it advisable in order to
avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of the Common Stock resulting
from any dividend or distribution of the Corporations shares (or issuance of
rights or warrants to acquire shares) or from any event treated as such for
income tax purposes or for any other reasons; provided that the
same proportionate adjustment must be made to each Fixed Conversion Rate. If
any adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rate is treated as a distribution to
any Non-U.S. Holder which is subject to withholding tax, the Corporation (or
Transfer Agent or any paying agent on behalf of the Corporation) may set off
any withholding tax that is required to be collected with respect to such
deemed distribution against cash payments and other distributions otherwise
deliverable to such Non-U.S. Holder.

 

(c) Calculation of Adjustments; Adjustments to Threshold Appreciation Price,
Initial Price, Applicable Market Value and Five-Day Average VWAP. 

(i) All required calculations will be made to the nearest cent or 1/10,000th
of a share.

 

If an adjustment is made to the Fixed Conversion Rates pursuant to this
Section 11, an inversely proportional adjustment shall also be made (x) to
the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Initial Price solely for purposes of
determining which of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the definition of
Conversion Rate shall apply on the Mandatory Conversion Date (subject to 

 



29  postponement as described in Section 5(a)), and (y) to the Floor Price. Such
adjustment shall be made by dividing each of the Threshold Appreciation Price
and the Initial Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be either
Fixed Conversion Rate immediately after such adjustment pursuant to clause
(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of Section 11(a) or Section 11(b) and the
denominator of which shall be such Fixed Conversion Rate immediately before
such adjustment. The Corporation shall make appropriate adjustments to the
VWAP per share of Common Stock used to calculate the Applicable Market Value
or the Five-Day Average VWAP, as the case may be, to account for
any adjustments to the Fixed Conversion Rates that became effective during
the period in which the Applicable Market Value or the Five-Day Average VWAP,
as the case may be, is being calculated.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding Section 11(a), no adjustment to the Fixed Conversion
Rates shall be made if Holders participate in the transaction that would
otherwise require an adjustment (other than in the case of a share split or
share combination), at the same time, upon the same terms and otherwise on the
same basis as holders of the Common Stock and solely as a result of holding
shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, as if such Holders held a number of
shares of Common Stock equal to the Maximum Conversion Rate as of the Record
Date for such transaction, multiplied by the number of shares of Series A-1
Preferred Stock held by such Holders.

(iii) The Fixed Conversion Rates shall not be adjusted except as provided
herein. Without limiting the foregoing, the Fixed Conversion Rates shall not
be adjusted for:

(A) the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or
future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on
the Corporations securities and the investment of additional optional amounts
in the Common Stock under any plan;

 

(B) the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to
purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or
consultant benefit plan, employee agreement or arrangement or program of the
Corporation or any Subsidiaries of the Corporation;

 

(C) the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option,
warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security
outstanding as of the Issue Date;

(D) a change solely in the par value of the Common Stock;

 

(E) stock repurchases that are not tender offers, including structured or
derivative transactions;

 

(F) as a result of a tender offer solely to holders of fewer than 100 shares
of Common Stock;

 

(G) a third-party tender or exchange offer; or

 

(H) the payment of dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, whether in
cash or in shares of Common Stock.

 

(iv) The Corporation shall have the power to resolve any ambiguity and its
action in so doing, as evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors,
shall be final and conclusive unless clearly inconsistent with the intent
hereof.

 



30 (d) Notice of Adjustment. Whenever a Fixed Conversion Rate or the Fundamental
Change Conversion Rate, as applicable, is to be adjusted, the Corporation
shall: (i) compute such adjusted Fixed Conversion Rate or the Fundamental
Change Conversion Rate, as applicable, and prepare and transmit to the
Transfer Agent an Officers Certificate setting forth such adjusted Fixed
Conversion Rate or the Fundamental Change Conversion Rate, as applicable, the
method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail and the facts requiring
such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; (ii) as soon as
practicable following the determination of a revised Fixed Conversion Rate or
Fundamental Change Conversion Rate, as applicable, provide, or cause to be
provided, a written notice to Holders of the occurrence of such event and
(iii) as soon as practicable following the determination of a revised Fixed
Conversion Rate or Fundamental Change Conversion Rate, as applicable, provide,
or cause to be provided, to Holders a statement setting forth in reasonable
detail the method by which the adjustment to such Fixed Conversion Rate or
the Fundamental Change Conversion Rate, as applicable, was determined and
setting forth such revised Fixed Conversion Rate or Fundamental Change
Conversion Rate, as applicable.

 

(e) Recapitalizations, Reclassifications and Changes of the Common Stock. In
the event of:

 

(A) any recapitalization, reclassification or change of the Common Stock
(other than changes only in par value or resulting from a subdivision or
combination);

(B) any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another Person
or any statutory exchange or binding share exchange; or

(C) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of all
or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation and its
Subsidiaries;

in each case as a result of which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged
for, or converted into, other securities, property or assets (including cash
or any combination thereof) (any such event, a "Reorganization Event"), then,
at the effective time of such Reorganization Event, each share of Series A-1
Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization Event
shall, without the consent of Holders, become convertible into the kind and
amount of such other securities, property or assets (including cash or any
combination thereof) that holders of the Common Stock received in such
Reorganization Event (the "Exchange Property"), and, at the effective time of
such Reorganization Event, the Corporation shall amend its Certificate of
Incorporation to provide for such change in the convertibility of the Series
A-1 Preferred Stock; provided that if the kind and amount of Exchange Property
receivable upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each share of
Common Stock held immediately prior to such 

 



31  Reorganization Event by a Person, then the Exchange Property receivable upon
such Reorganization Event shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the
types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of the Common
Stock that affirmatively make an election with respect to the kind and amount
of Exchange Property so receivable (or of all such holders if none makes an
election). The Conversion Rate then in effect shall be applied on the
applicable Conversion Date to the amount of such Exchange Property received
per share of Common Stock in the Reorganization Event (a "Unit of Exchange
Property"), as determined in accordance with this Section 11(e). For
the purpose of determining which clause of the definition of Conversion Rate
shall apply on the Mandatory Conversion Date (subject to postponement as
described in Section 5(a)) and for the purpose of calculating the Conversion
Rate if clause (ii) of the definition thereof is applicable, the value of a
Unit of Exchange Property shall be determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors, except that if a Unit of Exchange Property includes common stock or
American Depositary Receipts ("ADRs") that are traded on a U.S. national
securities exchange, the value of such common stock or ADRs shall be the
Applicable Market Value determined with regard to a share of such common stock
or a single ADR, as the case may be (or for the purpose of determining the
Stock Price on a Fundamental Change Conversion Date, the value of such common
stock or ADRs shall be the Five-Day Average VWAP determined with regard to a
share of such common stock or a single ADR, as the case may be). For the
purpose of paying accrued and unpaid dividends in Units of Exchange Property
in accordance with Section 4, the value of a Unit of Exchange Property shall
equal 97% of the value determined pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence. 

The above provisions of this Section 11(e) shall similarly apply to successive
Reorganization Events and the provisions of Section 11(a)-(d) shall apply to
any shares of capital stock of the Corporation (or of any successor) received
by the holders of Common Stock in any such Reorganization Event.

 

The amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation providing that the Series
A-1 Preferred Stock shall be convertible into Exchange Property shall also
provide for anti-dilution and other adjustments that are as nearly equivalent
as possible to the adjustments described under this Section 11. The
Corporation shall not become a party to any Reorganization event unless the
terms of such transaction are consistent with this Section 11(e).

The Corporation (or any successor) shall, as soon as reasonably practicable
(but in any event within five Business Days) after the occurrence of any
Reorganization Event, provide written notice to the Holders of such occurrence
of such Reorganization Event and of the kind and amount of the cash,
securities or other property that constitute the Exchange Property. Failure
to deliver such notice shall not affect the operation of this Section 11(e).

(f) For purposes of this Section 11, the number of shares of Common Stock at
any time outstanding shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip
certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.

 

Section 12. Liquidation Rights.

 

(a) Voluntary or Involuntary Liquidation. In the event of any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether
voluntary or involuntary, each Holder

 



32  shall be entitled to receive for each share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock,
out of the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof (whether capital or
surplus) available for distribution to stockholders of the Corporation,
subject to the rights of any creditors of the Corporation, before any payment
or distribution of such assets or proceeds is made to or set aside for the
holders of Common Stock and any other Junior Stock of the Corporation,
payment in full in an amount equal to the sum of (x) the Initial Liquidation
Preference and (y) an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends on each
share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, whether or not declared, to (but
not including) the date fixed for liquidation, dissolution or winding up
(such amounts collectively, the "Liquidation Preference").

 

(b) Partial Payment. If in any distribution described in Section 12(a) the
assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay in
full the amounts payable with respect to all outstanding shares of Series A-1
Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock as to such distribution, Holders and the
holders of such Parity Stock shall share ratably in any such distribution
in proportion to the full accrued and unpaid respective distributions to
which they are entitled.

(c) Residual Distributions. After payment of the full amount of the
Liquidation Preference, including an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid
dividends, to which they are entitled, Holders will have no right or claim to
any of the remaining assets of the Corporation (or proceeds thereof). 

(d) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation. For purposes of
this Section 12, the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into
any other corporation or other entity, or the sale, lease or exchange (for
cash, securities or other property) of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Corporation, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation.

Section 13. No Sinking Fund. The Series A-1 Preferred Stock will not be
subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar
provisions.

Section 14. Status of Converted or Repurchased Shares. Shares of Series
A-1 Preferred Stock that are duly converted in accordance herewith or
repurchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall revert to
authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, undesignated as to series
and available for future issuance; provided that any such cancelled shares of
Series A-1 Preferred Stock may be reissued only as shares of any series of
Preferred Stock other than Series A-1 Preferred Stock.

 

Section 15. Voting Rights.

(a) General. Holders shall not have any voting rights in respect of their
shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock except as set forth below or as otherwise
from time to time required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation. Except
as provided herein with respect to voting rights allocated pro rata with
other classes or series of Parity Stock based on the liquidation preference of
each such class or series, Holders will be entitled to one vote for each such
share on any matter on which Holders are entitled to vote, including any
action by written consent.

 



33 (b) Preferred Directors. Whenever, at any time or times, dividends payable on
the shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock have not been paid for an aggregate
of six or more Dividend Periods, whether or not consecutive (an "Event of Non-
payment"), the Holders will have the right, with holders of shares of any one
or more other classes or series of outstanding Parity Stock upon which like
voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable at the time, voting
together as a class (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the
liquidation preference of each such class or series), to elect two directors
(together, the "Preferred Directors" and each, a "Preferred Director") at the
next annual meeting or special meeting of the Corporations stockholders and
at each subsequent annual meeting or special meeting of the Corporations
stockholders until all accrued and unpaid dividends have been paid in full or
fully set aside for payment on Series A-1 Preferred Stock, at which time such
right will terminate, except as otherwise provided herein or expressly
provided by law, subject to reverting in the event of each and every Event of
Non-payment; provided that it will be a qualification for election for any
Preferred Director that the election of such Preferred Director will not
cause the Corporation to violate any corporate governance requirements of any
securities exchange or other trading facility on which the Corporations
securities may then be listed or traded that listed or traded
companies, including that the Corporation have a majority of independent
directors.

Upon any termination of the right set forth in the immediately preceding
paragraph, the Preferred Directors shall cease to be qualified as directors,
the term of office of all Preferred Directors then in office shall terminate
immediately and the authorized number of directors shall be reduced by the
number of Preferred Directors elected as described above.

Any Preferred Director may be removed at any time, with or without cause, and
any vacancy created thereby may be filled, only at a meeting of the
Corporations stockholders at which this is a permitted action by the
affirmative vote of the Holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of
Series A-1 Preferred Stock at the time outstanding voting separately as a
class together with the holders of shares of Parity Stock upon which like
voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable at the time (and with
voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each
such class or series), to the extent the voting rights of such Holders
described above are then exercisable. If the office of any Preferred Director
becomes vacant for any reason other than removal from office as described
above, the remaining Preferred Director may choose a successor who will hold
office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred.

 

At any time after the right of Holders to elect Preferred Directors has become
vested and is continuing but a meeting of the Corporations stockholders to
elect such Preferred Directors has not yet been held, or if a vacancy shall
exist in the office of any such Preferred Director that has not been filled by
the remaining Preferred Director, the Board of Directors may, but shall not
be required to, call a special meeting of Holders and the holders of any one
or more classes or series of outstanding Parity Stock upon which like voting
rights have been conferred and are exercisable at the time, for the
purpose of electing the Preferred Directors that such Holders and holders are
entitled to elect; provided that in the event the Board of Directors does not
call such special meeting, such election will be held at the next annual
meeting. At any such meeting held for the purpose of electing such Preferred
Director or Preferred Directors, as the case may be, (whether at an annual
meeting or special meeting), the presence in person or by proxy of the Holders
and holders of shares representing at least a majority of the voting power of

 



34  the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock having similar voting
rights shall be required to constitute a quorum of the Series A-1 Preferred
Stock and any Parity Stock having similar voting rights. The affirmative vote
of Holders and the holders of any Parity Stock having similar voting rights
constituting a majority of the voting power of such shares present at such
meeting, in person or by proxy, shall be sufficient to elect any such
Preferred Director.

(c) Voting Rights as to Particular Matters. So long as any shares of Series
A-1 Preferred Stock are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent
of stockholders required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the
affirmative vote or consent of the Holders of at least two-thirds in voting
power of the shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock at the time outstanding and
all other Parity Stock having similar voting rights that are exercisable at
the time, voting together as a single class (and with voting rights allocated
pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series),
given in person or by proxy, either by vote at any meeting called for such
purpose, or by written consent in lieu of such meeting, shall be necessary for
effecting or validating:

 

(i) Authorization of Senior Stock. Any amendment or alteration of the
Certificate of Incorporation to authorize or create or increase the
authorized amount of, or any issuance of, any shares of, or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of, any class or
series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking senior to Series A-1
Preferred Stock with respect to either or both the payment of dividends
and/or the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the Corporation ("Senior Stock");

 

(ii) Amendment of Series A-1 Preferred Stock. Any amendment, alteration or
repeal of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation (including,
unless no vote on such merger or consolidation is required by Section
15(c)(iii), any amendment, alteration or repeal by means of a merger,
consolidation or otherwise) so as to adversely affect the rights,
preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock;
or

(iii) Share Exchanges, Reclassifications, Mergers and Consolidations. Any
consummation of a binding share exchange, a reclassification involving the
Series A-1 Preferred Stock, or a merger or consolidation of the Corporation
with or into another corporation or other entity, unless in each case (x)
the Series A-1 Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the case of any
such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not the
surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preference
securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and
(y) the Series A-1 Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such new
preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences,
privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, taken
as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than
the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and
restrictions thereof, of Series A-1 Preferred Stock immediately prior to such
consummation, taken as a whole;

_provided_ , _however_ , that for all purposes of this Section 15(c), the
creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount,
whether pursuant to pre-emptive or similar rights or otherwise, of any series
of Preferred Stock, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or 

 



35  exercisable for any other series of Preferred Stock (including the Series
A-1 Preferred Stock), ranking equally with and/or junior to Series A-1
Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such
dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and the distribution of assets
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation shall not be
deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or
voting powers, and shall not require the affirmative vote or consent of, the
Holders.

(d) Procedures for Voting and Consents. The rules and procedures for calling
and conducting any meeting of Holders (including, without limitation, the
fixing of a record date in connection therewith), the solicitation and use of
proxies at such a meeting, the obtaining of written consents and any
other aspect or matter with regard to such a meeting or such consents shall
be governed by any rules the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may adopt
from time to time, which rules and procedures shall conform to the
requirements of the Certificate of Incorporation, the By-laws, applicable law
and the rules of any national securities exchange or other trading facility on
which the Series A-1 Preferred Stock is listed or traded at the time.

 

Section 16. Record Holders. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
the Corporation and the Transfer Agent may deem and treat the Record Holder
of any share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock as the absolute, true and lawful
owner thereof for all purposes, including, without limitation, for purposes of
making payment and settling conversions, to the fullest extent permitted by
law and neither the Corporation nor the Transfer Agent shall be affected by
any notice to the contrary.

Section 17. Notices. All notices or communications in respect of Series A-1
Preferred Stock shall be sufficiently given if given in writing and delivered
in person or by first class mail, postage prepaid, or if given in such other
manner as may be permitted in the Certificate of Incorporation, the By-laws
or by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if shares of Series A-1
Preferred Stock are issued in book-entry form through DTC or any similar
facility, such notices may be given to the Holders in any manner permitted by
such facility.

Section 18. No Pre-emptive Rights; No Redemption Right. No share of Series A-1
Preferred Stock or share of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Series
A-1 Preferred Stock shall have any rights of preemption whatsoever as to any
securities of the Corporation, or any warrants, rights or options issued or
granted with respect thereto, regardless of how such securities, or such
warrants, rights or options, may be designated, issued or granted. The Series
A-1 Preferred Stock are not redeemable.

 

Section 19. Replacement Stock Certificates.

 

(a) If physical certificates are issued, and any of the Series A-1 Preferred
Stock certificates shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Corporation shall, at the expense of the Holder thereof, issue, in exchange
and in substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated Series A-1
Preferred Stock certificate, or in lieu of and substitution for the lost,
stolen or destroyed Series A-1 Preferred Stock certificate, a new Series A-1
Preferred Stock certificate of like tenor and representing an equivalent
amount of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, but only upon receipt of
evidence of such loss, theft or destruction of such Series A-1 Preferred
Stock certificate and indemnity, if requested, satisfactory to the Corporation
and the Transfer Agent.

(b) The Corporation is not required to issue any certificate representing the
Series A-1 Preferred Stock on or after the Mandatory Conversion Date (subject
to postponement as described in Section 5(a)). In lieu of the delivery of a
replacement certificate following the Mandatory Conversion Date (subject to
postponement as described in Section 5(a)), the Transfer Agent, upon delivery
of the evidence and indemnity described in clause (a) above, shall deliver the
shares of Common Stock issuable, along with any other consideration payable
or deliverable, pursuant to the terms of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock
formerly evidenced by the certificate.

 



36 Section 20. Transfer Agent, Registrar, Conversion and Dividend Disbursing
Agent. The duly appointed Transfer Agent, Registrar, conversion and dividend
disbursing agent for the Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be Computershare
Trust Company N.A. The Corporation may, in its sole discretion, remove the
Transfer Agent in accordance with the agreement between the Corporation and
the Transfer Agent; provided that the Corporation shall appoint a successor
transfer agent who shall accept such appointment prior to the effectiveness of
such removal. Upon any such removal or appointment, the Corporation shall
send notice thereof by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders.

Section 21. Form.

 

(a) The Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be issued in the form of one or more
permanent global shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock in definitive, fully
registered form eligible for book-entry settlement with the global legend (the
"Global Shares Legend") as set forth on the form of Series A-1 Preferred Stock
certificate attached hereto as Schedule G (each, a "Global Preferred Share"),
which is hereby incorporated in and expressly made part of this Certificate of
Incorporation. The Global Preferred Shares may have notations, legends or
endorsements required by law, stock exchange rules, agreements to which the
Corporation is subject, if any, or usage (provided that any such notation,
legend or endorsement is in a form acceptable to the Corporation). The Global
Preferred Shares shall be deposited on behalf of the Holders represented
thereby with the Registrar, at its New York office as custodian for DTC (the
"Depositary"), and registered in the name of the Depositary or a nominee of
the Depositary, duly executed by the Corporation and countersigned and
registered by the Registrar as hereinafter provided. The aggregate number of
shares represented by each Global Preferred Share may from time to time be
increased or decreased by adjustments made on the records of the Registrar and
the Depositary or its nominee as hereinafter provided.

This Section 21(a) shall apply only to a Global Preferred Share deposited with
or on behalf of the Depositary. The Corporation shall execute and the
Registrar shall, in accordance with this Section 21(a), countersign and
deliver any Global Preferred Shares that (i) shall be registered in the name
of Cede and Co. or other nominee of the Depositary and (ii) shall be delivered
by the Registrar to Cede and Co. or pursuant to instructions received from Cede
and Co. or held by the Registrar as custodian for the Depositary pursuant to an
agreement between the Depositary and the Registrar. Members of,
or participants in, the Depositary ("Agent Members") shall have no rights
under this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with respect to
any Global Preferred Share held on their behalf by the Depositary or by the
Registrar as the

 



37  custodian of the Depositary, or under such Global Preferred Share, and the
Depositary may be treated by the Corporation, the Registrar and any agent of
the Corporation or the Registrar as the absolute owner of such Global
Preferred Share for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall prevent the Corporation, the Registrar or any agent of
the Corporation or the Registrar from giving effect to any
written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the
Depositary or impair, as between the Depositary and its Agent Members, the
operation of customary practices of the Depositary governing the exercise of
the rights of a holder of a beneficial interest in any Global Preferred
Share. The Holder of the Global Preferred Shares may grant proxies or
otherwise authorize any Person to take any action that a Holder is entitled to
take pursuant to the Global Preferred Shares or the Certificate of
Incorporation.

Owners of beneficial interests in Global Preferred Shares shall not be
entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated shares of Series A-1
Preferred Stock, unless (x) the Depositary notifies the Corporation that it is
unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the Global Preferred Shares
and the Corporation does not appoint a qualified replacement for the
Depositary within 90 days or (y) the Depositary ceases to be a "clearing
agency" registered under the Exchange Act and the Corporation does not appoint
a qualified replacement for the Depositary within 90 days. In any such case,
the Global Preferred Shares shall be exchanged in whole for definitive stock
certificates that are not issued in global form, with the same terms and of an
equal aggregate Liquidation Preference, and such definitive
stock certificates shall be registered in the name or names of the Person or
Persons specified by the Depositary in a written instrument to the Registrar.

 

(b) Signature. Two Officers permitted by applicable law shall sign each Global
Preferred Share for the Corporation, in accordance with the Corporations
Bylaws and applicable law, by manual or facsimile signature. If an Officer
whose signature is on a Global Preferred Share no longer holds that office at
the time the Registrar countersigned such Global Preferred Share, such
Global Preferred Share shall be valid nevertheless. A Global Preferred Share
shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Registrar manually
countersigns such Global Preferred Share. Each Global Preferred Share shall be
dated the date of its countersignature. The foregoing paragraph shall
likewise apply to any certificate representing shares of Series A-1 Preferred
Stock.

 

Section 22. Stock Transfer and Stamp Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and
all stock transfer and documentary stamp taxes that may be payable in respect
of any issuance or delivery of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock or shares
of Common Stock or other securities issued on account of Series A-1 Preferred
Stock pursuant hereto or certificates representing such shares or securities.
The Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any such tax that may
be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of
shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock or Common Stock or other securities in a
name other than that in which the shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock with
respect to which such shares or other securities are issued or delivered were
registered, or in respect of any payment to any Person other than a payment to
the Holder thereof, and shall not be required to make any such issuance,
delivery or payment unless and until the Person otherwise entitled to such
issuance, delivery or payment has paid to the Corporation the amount of any
such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



38 Section 23. Listing. The Corporation hereby covenants and agrees that, if its
listing application for the Series A-1 Preferred Stock is approved, upon such
listing, the Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep the
Series A-1 Preferred Stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

 

If the Global Preferred Share or Global Preferred Shares, as the case maybe,
or the Series A-1 Preferred Stock represented thereby shall be listed on the
New York Stock Exchange or any other stock exchange, the Depositary may, with
the written approval of the Corporation, appoint a registrar (acceptable to
the Corporation) for registration of such Global Preferred Share or
Global Preferred Shares, as the case may be, or the Series A-1 Preferred
Stock represented thereby in accordance with the requirements of such
exchange. Such registrar (which may be the Registrar if so permitted by the
requirements of such exchange) may be removed and a substitute registrar
appointed by the Registrar upon the request or with the written approval of
the Corporation. If the Global Preferred Share or Global Preferred Shares, as
the case may be or the Series A-1 Preferred Stock represented thereby are
listed on one or more other stock exchanges, the Registrar will, at the
request and expense of the Corporation, arrange such facilities for the
delivery, transfer, surrender and exchange of such Global Preferred Share
or Global Preferred Shares, as the case may be, or the Series A-1 Preferred
Stock represented thereby as may be required by law or applicable stock
exchange regulations.

 

Section 24. Ranking. Notwithstanding anything in this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, the Series A-1 Preferred Stock
will, with respect to dividend rights or rights upon the liquidation, winding-
up or dissolution of the Corporation rank (i) senior to any Junior Stock, (ii)
on parity with any Parity Stock and (iii) junior to any Senior Stock and
the Corporations existing and future indebtedness (including trade
payables).

Section 25. Other Rights. The shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall not
have any rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers or relative,
participating, optional or other special rights, or qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereof, other than as set forth herein or in
the Certificate of Incorporation or as provided by applicable law.

1\. _Provisions Relating to the Common Stock_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or by the DGCL, each holder of shares of Common
Stock shall be entitled, with respect to each share of Common Stock held by
such holder, to one vote in person or by proxy on all matters submitted to a

or otherwise.

(b) Subject to the preferences and rights, if any, applicable to shares of
Preferred Stock or any series thereof, the holders of shares of Common Stock
shall be entitled to receive such dividends and other distributions in cash,
property, stock or otherwise as may be declared thereon by the Board of
Directors at any time and from time to time out of assets or funds of the
Corporation legally available therefor and shall share equally on a per share

other series of Preferred Stock, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation including any Preferred
Stock Certificate of Designation or pursuant to the DGCL as currently in
effect or as the same may hereafter be amended.

 



2 3\. _Voting in Election of Directors_. Except as may be required by the DGCL

Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any matter or receive notice of any
meeting of stockholders.

 

 _FIFTH_. _Management of Corporation_. The following provisions are inserted
for the management of the business, for the conduct of the affairs of the
Corporation and for the purpose of creating, defining, limiting and regulating
the powers of the Corporation and its directors and stockholders:

 

1\. Except as may otherwise be provided by law, this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Amended and Restated By-laws of
the Corporation, as amended from time to time (the " _By-laws_ "), the
business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the
direction of the Board of Directors.

 

2\. Except as otherwise provided in and subject to Article XI of the By-laws,
and subject to any rights granted to the holders of shares of any class or
series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, the number of directors of the
Corporation shall be fixed, and may be altered from time to time, exclusively
by resolution of the Board of Directors, but in no event may the number of
directors of the Corporation be less than one.

3\. The directors of the Corporation (other than those directors, if any,
elected by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock provided for or fixed
pursuant to the provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation) shall be divided into three classes designated Class I, Class
II and Class III. Each class shall consist, as nearly as possible, of one-
third of the total number of such directors. Class I directors shall initially
serve for a term expiring at the first annual meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation (the " _Effective Date_ "), Class II directors
shall initially serve for a term expiring at the second annual meeting of
stockholders following the Effective Date and Class III directors shall
initially serve for a term expiring at the third annual meeting of
stockholders following the Effective Date. Directors of each class shall hold
office until the annual meeting at which his or her term expires and until
his or her successor shall be elected and qualified, or his or her death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. Commencing
with the first annual meeting of stockholders following the Effective Date and
at each succeeding annual meeting, successors to the class of directors whose
term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a term expiring at
the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders, subject to any rights
granted to 

 



3  holders of shares of any class or series of Preferred Stock then outstanding
to elect directors. If the number of such directors is changed, any increase
or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the
number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any such
additional director of any class elected to fill a newly created directorship
resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term that
shall coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no case shall a
decrease in the number of directors remove or shorten the term of any
incumbent director. The Board of Directors is authorized to assign members
of the Board of Directors already in office to their respective class.

4\. Subject to any rights granted to the holders of shares of any class or
series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, a director may be removed from
office only for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock then entitled to
vote in an election of directors.

5\. Except as otherwise provided by law or as otherwise provided in or subject
to Article XI of the By-laws, and subject to any rights granted to the
holders of shares of any class or series of Preferred Stock then outstanding,
any vacancy in the Board of Directors that results from an increase in the
number of directors, from the death, disability, resignation,
disqualification or removal of any director or from any other cause shall be
filled solely by an affirmative vote of at least a majority of the directors
then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
A director elected to fill a vacancy or a newly created directorship shall
hold office until the next election of the class for which such director shall
have been chosen and until his or her successor has been elected
and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal.

6\. No director of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of his or her fiduciary duty as a
director, except that such directors may be liable ( _i_ ) for breach of the
directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, ( _ii_ )
for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct
or a knowing violation of law, ( _iii_ ) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (
_iv_ ) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper
personal benefit.

7\. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, the Corporation shall
indemnify and advance expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred, to each
person who is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding by reason of the
fact that the person is or was a director of the Corporation, _provided_ that,
except as otherwise provided in the By-laws, the Corporation shall not be
obligated to indemnify or advance expenses to a director of the Corporation
in respect of an action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) instituted by
such director, unless such action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) has
been authorized by the Board of Directors. The 

 



4  rights provided by this Section 7 of Article FIFTH shall not limit or
exclude any rights, indemnities or limitations of liability to which any
director of the Corporation may be entitled, whether as a matter of law,
under the By-laws, by agreement, vote of the stockholders, approval of the
directors of the Corporation or otherwise.

 

8\. Unless and except to the extent the By-laws shall so require, the election
of directors of the Corporation need not be by written ballot.

_SIXTH_. _Stockholder Action by Written Consent_. Any action required or
permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation may be taken only upon the vote of the stockholders at an annual
or special meeting duly called and may not be taken by written consent of the
stockholders.

 

 _SEVENTH_. _Special Meetings_. Except as otherwise required by law and
subject to any rights granted to holders of shares of any class or series of
Preferred Stock then outstanding, special meetings of the stockholders of the
Corporation for any purpose or purposes may be called only pursuant to a
resolution of the Board of Directors adopted by at least a majority of the
directors then in office. The stockholders of the Corporation shall not have
the power to call a special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation or
to request the Secretary of the Corporation to call a special meeting of
the stockholders.

_EIGHTH_. _Amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation_. The Corporation
reserves the right to amend, alter or repeal any provision contained in this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation in the manner now or
hereafter prescribed by the DGCL, and all rights herein conferred upon
stockholders or directors are granted subject to this reservation, _provided_
, _however_ , that any amendment, alteration or repeal of Sections 6 or 7 of
Article FIFTH shall not adversely affect any right or protection existing
under this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
immediately prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal, including any right
or protection of a director thereunder in respect of any act or omission
occurring prior to the time of such amendment, alteration or repeal.

 

 _NINTH_. _Amendment of the By-laws_. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the powers conferred by law, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized
to amend, alter or repeal the By-laws, without the assent or vote of
stockholders of the Corporation. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of the
By-laws by the Board of Directors shall require the affirmative vote of at
least a majority of the directors then in office; _provided_ that, during the
period beginning at the Merger 2 Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 15, 2016, by and among
Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc., AmSurg Corp. and New Amethyst Corp., as
amended from time to time) and ending on the third (3rd) anniversary of the
Merger 2 Effective Time, the provisions of Article XI of the By-laws may be
amended, altered or repealed by the Board of Directors, and any By-law
provision or other resolution inconsistent with Article XI of the By-laws may
be adopted by the Board of Directors, only by the affirmative vote of three-
fourths of the Board of Directors. In addition to any other vote

 



5  otherwise required by law, the stockholders of the Corporation may amend,
alter or repeal the By-laws only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote
at any annual or special meeting of stockholders. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Article NINTH, on the third (3rd) anniversary of the
Merger 2 Effective Time, Article XI of the By-laws shall, automatically and
without any action on the part of the Board of Directors or the stockholders
of the Corporation, become void and be of no further force or effect.

 

 _TENTH_. _Exclusive Jurisdiction for Certain Actions_. Unless the
Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the " _Court of Chancery_ ")
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum
for ( _a_ ) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the
Corporation, ( _b_ ) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary
duty owed by any director, officer, employee, agent or stockholder of the
Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporations stockholders, ( _c_ ) any
action asserting a claim arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the
DGCL, or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery
(including, without limitation, any action asserting a claim arising out of or
pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or
the By-laws), or ( _d_ ) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal
affairs doctrine. Any person or entity holding, purchasing or otherwise
acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be
deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article
TENTH.

The exact Stock Price and Effective Date may not be set forth in the table, in
which case:

 

(i) if the Stock Price is between two Stock Price amounts in the table or the
Effective Date is between two Effective Date dates in the table, the
Fundamental Change Conversion Rate shall be determined by straight-line
interpolation between the Fundamental Change Conversion Rates set forth for
the higher and lower Stock Price amounts and the two Effective Date dates,
as applicable, based on a 365-day year;

(ii) if the Stock Price is greater than $200.00 per share (subject to
adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Prices set forth in the column
headings of the table above pursuant to the immediately succeeding paragraph),
then the Fundamental Change Conversion Rate shall be the Minimum Conversion
Rate, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 11; and

(iii) if the Stock Price is less than $10.00 per share (subject to adjustment
in the same manner as the Stock Prices set forth in the column headings of
the table above pursuant to the immediately succeeding paragraph) (the
"Minimum Stock Price"), then the Fundamental Change Conversion Rate shall be
determined (a) as if the Stock Price equaled the Minimum Stock Price and (b)
if the Effective Date is between two Effective Date dates on the table, using
straight-line interpolation, as described herein.

 

The Stock Prices set forth in the first row of the table (i.e., the column
headers) shall be adjusted as of any date on which the Fixed Conversion Rates
are adjusted. The adjusted Stock Prices shall equal the Stock Prices
applicable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Minimum Conversion Rate immediately prior to the
adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of

shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of
Directors and to the extent lawful, cumulative dividends at a rate per year of
5.250% of the Initial Liquidation Preference (equivalent to $5.25 per year per
share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock), payable in cash, by delivery of shares
of Common Stock or by delivery of any combination of cash and shares of Common
Stock, as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion (subject to the
limitations described in Section 4). Declared dividends on the Series A-1
Preferred Stock shall be payable quarterly on each Dividend Payment Date at
such annual rate, and dividends shall accumulate from the most recent date as
to which dividends shall have been paid or, if no dividends have been paid,
from the Initial Issue Date, whether or not declared or in any Dividend Period
or Dividend Periods, as the case may be, there have been funds or shares of
Common Stock legally available for the payment of such dividends. Dividends

but only to the extent a dividend has been declared to be payable on
such Dividend Payment Date, except that dividends payable on the Mandatory
Conversion Date will be payable to the Holders

 



10  presenting the Series A-1 Preferred Stock for conversion. If any Dividend
Payment Date is not a Business Day, the dividend payable on such date shall be

penalty in respect of such delay. Dividends payable on shares of Series A-1
Preferred Stock for each full Dividend Period shall be computed by dividing

Preferred Stock for any period other than a full Dividend Period shall be

on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
Accumulated dividends on shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall not bear
interest if they are paid subsequent to the applicable Dividend Payment Date.

 

(b) No dividend shall be declared or paid upon, or any sum set apart for the
payment of dividends upon, any outstanding share of the Series A-1 Preferred
Stock with respect to any Dividend Period unless all dividends for all
preceding Dividend Periods shall have been declared and paid, or declared and
a sufficient sum has been set apart for the payment of such dividends, upon
all outstanding shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock. No dividend shall be
paid unless and until the Board of Directors declares a dividend payable with
respect to the Series A-1 Preferred Stock.

 

(c) Holders shall not be entitled to any dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred
Stock, whether payable in cash, shares of Common Stock or any combination
thereof, in excess of full cumulative dividends.

(d)

 

(i) So long as any share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock remains outstanding:

 

(A) no dividend or distribution shall be declared or paid on the Common Stock
or any other shares of Junior Stock, except dividends payable solely in
shares of Common Stock;

(B) no dividend or distribution shall be declared or paid on Parity Stock,
except as set forth in this Section 3(d); and

(C) no Common Stock, Junior Stock or Parity Stock shall be, directly or
indirectly, purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries,

 

unless all accrued and unpaid dividends for all past Dividend Periods,
including the latest completed Dividend Period, on all outstanding shares of
Series A-1 Preferred Stock have been or are contemporaneously declared and
paid in full (or have been declared and a sum sufficient for the payment
thereof has been set aside for the benefit of the Holders on the
applicable Regular Record Date).

(ii) The limitations set forth in Section 3(d)(i) shall not apply to:

 

(A) redemptions, purchases or other acquisitions of shares of Common Stock or
other Junior Stock in connection with the administration of any

 



11  employee benefit plan in the ordinary course of business (including
purchases of shares of Common Stock in lieu of tax withholding and purchases
of shares of Common Stock to offset the Share Dilution Amount pursuant to a
publicly announced repurchase plan); provided that any purchases to offset the
Share Dilution Amount shall in no event exceed the Share Dilution Amount;

 

(B) any dividends or distributions of rights or Junior Stock in connection
with a stockholders rights plan or any redemption or repurchase of rights
pursuant to any stockholders rights plan;

(C) the acquisition by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries of record
ownership in Junior Stock or Parity Stock for the beneficial ownership of any
other Persons (other than for the beneficial ownership by the Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries), including as trustees or custodians; and

(D) the exchange or conversion of Junior Stock for or into other Junior Stock
or of Parity Stock for or into other Parity Stock (with the same or lesser
aggregate liquidation preference) or Junior Stock and, in each case, the
payment of cash solely in lieu of fractional shares.

 

When dividends are not paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment
thereof set aside for the benefit of the Holders thereof on the applicable
Regular Record Date) on any Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity
Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates,
on a dividend payment date falling within a Dividend Period related to
such Dividend Payment Date) in full upon the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and
any shares of Parity Stock, all dividends declared on Series A-1 Preferred
Stock and all such Parity Stock and payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or,
in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the
Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within the Dividend
Period related to such Dividend Payment Date) shall be declared and paid pro
rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends declared shall bear the
same ratio to each other as all accrued and unpaid dividends per share on the
shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock and all Parity Stock payable on such
Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend
payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment
date falling within the Dividend Period related to such Dividend Payment Date)
(subject to their having been declared by the Board of Directors out of funds
of the Corporation lawfully available and including, in the case of Parity
Stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued but unpaid dividends) bear
to each other. If the Board of Directors determines not to pay any dividend or
a full dividend on a Dividend Payment Date, the Corporation will provide a 10
Business Days written notice to the Holders prior to such Dividend Payment
Date.

 

Subject to the foregoing, dividends (payable in cash, securities or other
property) as may be determined by the Board of Directors may be declared and
paid on any securities of the Corporation, including Common Stock and other
Junior Stock, from time to time out of any funds of the Corporation lawfully
available for such payment, and Holders shall not be entitled to participate
in any such dividends.

 



12 Section 4. Method of Payment of Dividends.

 

(a) Subject to the limitations described below, any declared dividend (or any
portion of any declared dividend) on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, whether
or not for a current Dividend Period or any prior Dividend Period, including
in connection with the payment of declared and unpaid dividends, may be paid
by the Corporation, as determined in the Corporations sole discretion: 

(i) in cash;

 

(ii) by delivery of shares of Common Stock; or

 

(iii) by delivery, of any combination of cash and shares of Common Stock;

 

 _provided_ that in the case of a Fundamental Change Conversion that is a
Reorganization Event, dividends otherwise payable in shares of Common Stock
may be paid by delivery of Units of Exchange Property in accordance with
Section 11(e); and provided further that if the Board of Directors may not
lawfully authorize payment of all or any portion of such accrued and unpaid
dividends in cash, it shall authorize payment of such dividends in shares of
Common Stock or Units of Exchange Property, as the case may be, if lawfully
permitted to do so.

 

(b) Each payment of a declared dividend on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock
shall be made in cash, except to the extent the Corporation timely elects to
make all or any portion of such payment in shares of Common Stock. The
Corporation shall give notice to Holders of any such election and the portions
of such payment that will be made in cash and in shares of Common Stock no
later than 10 Scheduled Trading Days prior to the Dividend Payment Date for
such dividend; provided that if the Corporation does not provide timely notice
of such election, the Corporation will be deemed to have elected to pay the
relevant dividend in cash.

 

(c) If the Corporation elects to pay any dividend or portion thereof in shares
of Common Stock, such shares of Common Stock shall be valued for such purpose
at 97% of the Average VWAP per Common Share over the five consecutive Trading
Day period beginning on and including the seventh Scheduled Trading Day prior
to the applicable Dividend Payment Date (the "Average Price"). 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the number of shares of
Common Stock to be delivered, in connection with any declared dividend on the
Series A-1 Preferred Stock, including any dividend payable in connection with
a conversion, exceed a number equal to the total dividend payment divided by
$15.75, subject to adjustment in a manner inversely proportional to any
adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 11 (such
dollar amount, as adjusted from time to time, the "Floor Price"). To the
extent that the amount of any declared dividend exceeds the product of (x) the
number of shares of Common Stock delivered in connection with such declared
dividend and (y) 97% of the Average Price, the Corporation shall, if it is
legally able to do so, notwithstanding any notice by the Corporation to the
contrary, pay such excess amount in cash.

(e) To the extent that the Corporation, in its reasonable judgment, determines
that a Shelf Registration Statement is required in connection with the
issuance of, or for resales of,

 



13  shares of Common Stock issued as payment of a dividend on the Series A-1
Preferred Stock, including dividends paid in connection with a conversion, the
Corporation shall, to the extent such a Shelf Registration Statement is not
currently filed and effective, use its commercially reasonable efforts to file
and maintain the effectiveness of such a Shelf Registration Statement until
the earlier of such time as all such shares of Common Stock have been resold
thereunder and such time as all such shares would be freely tradable without
registration by holders thereof that are not "affiliates" of the Corporation
for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. To the extent
applicable, the Corporation shall also use its commercially reasonable efforts
to have such shares of Common Stock qualified or registered under applicable
state securities laws, if required, and approved for listing on the New York
Stock Exchange (or if the shares of Common Stock are not then listed on the
New York Stock Exchange, on the principal other U.S. national or regional
securities exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are then listed).

 

(f) In respect of any cash paid, shares of Common Stock issued or Units of
Exchange Property delivered in payment or partial payment of a dividend to a
Non-U.S. Holder, the Corporation shall withhold and, in the case of such
shares of Common Stock or Units of Exchange Property, the Corporation may do
so by selling (or directing the Transfer Agent or any paying agent on behalf
of the Corporation to withhold and sell) such amount in cash, number of
shares of Common Stock or Units of Exchange Property as the Corporation deems
necessary, to result in proceeds from such sale (after deduction of customary
commissions, which shall be for the account of such Non-U.S. Holder) to pay
all or any part of any U.S. withholding tax obligation that the Corporation
has (as determined by it in its sole discretion) in respect of the payment or
partial payment of such dividend of cash, shares of Common Stock or Units of
Exchange Property to such Non-U.S. Holder.

Section 5. Mandatory Conversion on the Mandatory Conversion Date.

(a) Each outstanding share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall automatically
convert on the Mandatory Conversion Date into a number of shares of Common
Stock equal to the Conversion Rate, unless such share of Series A-1 Preferred
Stock has been converted prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date in the manner
described in Section 6 or Section 7; provided that if the
Mandatory Conversion Date is not a Business Day, the Mandatory Conversion
Date shall be postponed to the following Business Day; provided further, that
if the Applicable Market Value is first determinable on a date later than the
Mandatory Conversion Date because there are one or more Scheduled Trading
Days that are not Trading Days during the 20 consecutive Scheduled Trading Day
period commencing on and including the 22nd Scheduled Trading Day prior to the
Mandatory Conversion Date, the Mandatory Conversion Date shall be postponed
to such later date.

(b) Each of the Fixed Conversion Rates, the Initial Price, the
Threshold Appreciation Price, the Floor Price, the Fundamental Change Date,
and the Applicable Market Value shall be subject to adjustment in accordance
with the provisions of Section 11.

 

(c) If prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date the Corporation has not declared
all or any portion of the accumulated dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred
Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that Holders receive an
additional number of shares of Common Stock equal

 



14  to the amount of accumulated dividends that have not been declared (the
"Additional Conversion Amount") divided by the greater of the Floor Price and
97% of the Average Price. To the extent that the Additional Conversion Amount
exceeds the product of such number of additional shares of Common Stock and
97% of the Average Price, the Corporation shall, if the Corporation is legally
able to do so, declare and pay such excess amount in cash pro rata to the
Holders.

Section 6. Optional Conversion at the Option of the Holder.

 

(a) Holders shall have the right to convert their shares of Series A-1
Preferred Stock, in whole or in part (but in no event less than one share
Series A-1 Preferred Stock) (any conversion pursuant to this Section 6, an
"Optional Conversion"), at any time prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date,
other than during the Fundamental Change Conversion Period, into shares of
Common Stock at the Minimum Conversion Rate, subject to adjustment in
accordance with Section 11.

(b) If as of any Optional Conversion Date the Corporation has not declared
all or any portion of the accumulated and unpaid dividends for all full
Dividend Periods ending on a Dividend Payment Date prior to such Optional
Conversion Date, the Minimum Conversion Rate shall be adjusted, with respect
to the relevant Optional Conversion, so that the converting Holder receives an
additional number of shares of Common Stock equal to the amount of accumulated
and unpaid dividends that have not been declared for such full Dividend
Periods (the "Optional Conversion Additional Conversion Amount"), divided by
the greater of the Floor Price and the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock
over the 20 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the
22nd Trading Day prior to the Optional Conversion Date (such average being
referred to as the "Optional Conversion Average Price"). To the extent that
the Optional Conversion Additional Conversion Amount exceeds the product of
the number of additional shares and the Optional Conversion Average Price,
the Corporation will not have any obligation to pay the shortfall in cash.
Except as described in the first sentence of this Section 6(b), upon any
Optional Conversion of any shares of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, the
Corporation shall make no payment or allowance for undeclared dividends on
such shares of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, unless such Optional Conversion
occurs after the Record Date for a declared dividend and on or prior to the
immediately succeeding Dividend Payment Date, in which case the Corporation
shall pay such dividend on such Dividend Payment Date to the Record Holder of
the converted shares as of such Record Date, in accordance with Section 3.

 

(c) To effect an Optional Conversion, the converting Holder shall comply with
the applicable conversion procedures set forth in Section 8. The Corporation
shall, in accordance with the instructions provided by the Holder thereof in
the written notice of conversion provided to the Corporation pursuant to
Section 8, deliver to the Holder the whole number of shares of Common Stock to
which the converting Holder shall be entitled upon such Optional Conversion,
together with payment of cash in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common
Stock, as provided in Section 10, and any certificate or certificates, as the
case may be, representing shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, as provided
in Section 8(d)(i). Such delivery shall take place on the third Business Day
succeeding the Optional Conversion Date. If applicable, the Corporation shall
instruct the Transfer Agent to register the whole number of shares of Common
Stock to which the converting Holder shall be entitled upon such Optional
Conversion in the name or names, as the case may be, specified by such Holder
in the notice of conversion.

 



15 Section 7. Fundamental Change Conversion.

 

(a) If a Fundamental Change occurs on or prior to the Mandatory Conversion
Date, Holders, subject to adjustments in accordance with Section 11, shall
have the right to:

(i) convert their Series A-1 Preferred Stock, in whole or in part (but in no
event less than one Series A-1 Preferred Stock) (any such conversion pursuant
to this Section 7 being a "Fundamental Change Conversion") at any time during
the period (the "Fundamental Change Conversion Period") from and including the
Effective Date of such Fundamental Change to, but excluding, the earlier of
(i) the Mandatory Conversion Date and (ii) the date that is 30 calendar days
after the Effective Date (any conversion pursuant to this Section 7, a
"Fundamental Change Conversion") (1) into a number of shares of Common Stock
equal to the Fundamental Change Conversion Rate per share of Series A-1
Preferred Stock; or (2) if the Fundamental Change also constitutes a
Reorganization Event, Units of Exchange Property in accordance with Section
11(e), based on the Fundamental Change Conversion Rate;

(ii) with respect to such converted shares, receive a Fundamental Change
Dividend Make-whole Amount payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock; and

 

(iii) with respect to such converted shares, receive the Accumulated Dividend
Amount payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock;

subject, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to the Corporations right to
deliver shares of Common Stock in lieu of all or part of such amounts as set
forth in Section 7(d). Such delivery shall take place on the third Business
Day following the applicable Fundamental Change Conversion Date.

 

Notwithstanding clauses (ii) and (iii), if such Effective Date or the relevant
Fundamental Change Conversion Date falls during a Dividend Period for which
the Corporation declared a dividend, the Corporation shall pay such dividend
on such Dividend Payment Date to the Record Holders as of such Record Date, in
accordance with Section 3, and such dividend shall not be included in
the Accumulated Dividend Amount, and the Fundamental Change Dividend Make-
whole Amount shall not include the present value of such dividend.

 

(b) To the extent practicable, at least 20 calendar days prior to the
anticipated Effective Date of the Fundamental Change, but in any event not
later than two Business Days following the Corporations becoming aware of the
occurrence of a Fundamental Change, a written notice shall be sent by or on
behalf of the Corporation, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the
Record Holders. Such notice shall contain:

(i) the date on which the Fundamental Change is anticipated to be effected;

 

(ii) the Fundamental Change Conversion Period;

 

(iii) the instructions a Holder must follow to effect a Fundamental Change
Conversion in connection with such Fundamental Change; and

(iv) whether the Corporation has elected to pay all or any portion of accrued
and unpaid dividends in shares of Common Stock or Units of Exchange Property,
as the case may be, and, if so, the portion thereof (as a percentage) that
will be paid in shares of Common Stock or Units of Exchange Property.

 



16 (c) To effect a Fundamental Change Conversion, the converting Holder must
submit its Series A-1 Preferred Stock for conversion and comply with the
applicable conversion procedures set forth in Section 8 at any time during the
Fundamental Change Conversion Period. Holders who do not submit Series A-1
Preferred Stock for conversion during the Fundamental Change Conversion
Period will not be entitled to convert their Series A-1 Preferred Stock at the
Fundamental Change Conversion Rate or to receive the Fundamental Change
Dividend Make-whole Amount or the Accumulated Dividend Amount. To the extent
a Holder does not convert its shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock pursuant to
this Section 7 and a Reorganization Event has occurred, in lieu of shares of
Common Stock, the Corporation shall pay or deliver, as the case may be, to
such Holder on the Mandatory Conversion Date, Units of Exchange Property as
determined in accordance with Section 11(e).

(d)

 

(i) For any shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock that are converted during the
Fundamental Change Conversion Period, in addition to the shares of Common
Stock issued upon conversion at the Fundamental Change Conversion Rate, the
Corporation will at its option:

 

(A) pay the Holder in cash, to the extent the Corporation is legally permitted
to do so, the present value, computed using a discount rate of 5.250% per
year, of all dividend payments on the Holders Series A-1 Preferred Stock for
all the remaining Dividend Periods (excluding any accumulated and unpaid
dividends for all Dividend Periods ending on or prior to the Dividend Payment
Date preceding the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change as well as
dividends accumulated to the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change) from
such Effective Date to but excluding the Mandatory Conversion Date
(the "Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole Amount");

(B) increase the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued on conversion
by a number equal to (x) the Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole Amount
divided by (y) the greater of the Floor Price and 97% of the Stock Price, or

 

(C) pay the Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole Amount in a combination of
cash and shares of Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of clauses
(A) and (B) above.

(ii) In addition, for any Series A-1 Preferred Stock that are
converted during the Fundamental Change Conversion Period, to the extent
that, as of the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change, the Corporation has
not declared any or all of the accumulated dividends on the Series A-1
Preferred Stock as of such Effective Date (including

 



17  accumulated and unpaid dividends for all dividend periods ending on or prior
to the Dividend Payment Date preceding the Effective Date of the Fundamental
Change as well as dividends accumulated to the Effective Date of the
Fundamental Change, the "Accumulated Dividend Amount"), Holders who convert
Series A-1 Preferred Stock within the Fundamental Change Conversion Period
will be entitled to receive such Accumulated Dividend Amount upon conversion.
The Accumulated Dividend Amount will be payable at the Corporations election
in either:

(A) cash, to the extent the Corporation is legally permitted to do so,

(B) an additional number of shares of Common Stock equal to (x) the
Accumulated Dividend Amount divided by (y) the greater of the Floor Price and
97% of the Stock Price, or

 

(C) a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock.

 

(iii) The Corporation shall pay the Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole
Amount and the Accumulated Dividend Amount in cash, except to the extent the
Corporation elects on or prior to the second Business Day following the
Effective Date of a Fundamental Change to make all or any portion of such
payments in shares of Common Stock. If the Corporation elects to
deliver shares of Common Stock in respect of all or any portion of the
Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole Amount or Accumulated Dividend Amount,
to the extent that the Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole Amount or the
Accumulated Dividend Amount or any portion thereof paid in shares of Common
Stock exceeds the product of the number of additional shares the Corporation
delivers in respect thereof and 97% of the Stock Price, the Corporation shall,
if it is legally able to do so, declare and pay such excess amount in cash.

(e) Not later than the second Business Day following the Effective Date, the
Corporation shall notify Holders of:

(i) the Fundamental Change Conversion Rate;

 

(ii) the Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole Amount and whether the
Corporation will pay such amount in cash, shares of Common Stock or a
combination thereof, and specifying the combination thereof, if applicable;
and

(iii) the Accumulated Dividend Amount as of the Effective Date and whether
the Corporation will pay such amount in cash, shares of Common Stock or a
combination thereof, and if applicable, specifying the combination thereof, if
applicable.

 

Section 8. Conversion Procedures.

 

(a) On the Mandatory Conversion Date, any Fundamental Change Conversion Date
or any Optional Conversion Date (each, a "Conversion Date"), dividends on any
shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock converted to Common Stock shall cease to
accrue and cumulate, and on the Mandatory Conversion Date (subject to
postponement as described in Section 5(a)), such converted shares of Series
A-1 Preferred Stock shall cease to be outstanding, in each case,

 



18  subject to the right of Holders of such shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock
to receive shares of Common Stock (or Units of Exchange Property, if
applicable) into which such shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock were
converted and any accrued and unpaid dividends on such shares to which such
Holders are otherwise entitled pursuant to Section 5(c), Section 6(b) or
Section 7(d), as applicable.

 

(b) Subject to postponement as described in Section 5(a), on the Mandatory
Conversion Date, pursuant to Section 5, any outstanding shares of Series A-1
Preferred Stock shall automatically convert into shares of Common Stock. The
Person or Persons entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon any such
conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be treated as the record
holder or record holders, as the case may be, of such shares of Common Stock
as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable Conversion Date. Except
as provided under Section 11, prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on such
applicable Conversion Date, shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of any shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall not be outstanding for any
purpose, and Holders of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall have no
rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock, including, without
limitation, voting rights, rights to respond to tender offers for the Common
Stock and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the Common
Stock, by virtue of holding shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock. No
allowance or adjustment, except as set forth in Section 11, shall be made in
respect of dividends payable to holders of record of Common Stock as of any
date prior to such applicable Conversion Date.

 

(c) To effect an Optional Conversion pursuant to Section 6 or a Fundamental
Change Conversion pursuant to Section 7, a Holder who

 

(i) holds a beneficial interest in a Global Preferred Share must deliver to
DTC the appropriate instruction form for conversion pursuant to DTCs
conversion program and, if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes or
duties, if any; or

(ii) holds Series A-1 Preferred Stock in definitive, certificated form must:

(A) complete and manually sign the conversion notice on the back of the
Series A-1 Preferred Stock certificate or a facsimile of such conversion
notice;

(B) deliver the completed conversion notice and the certificated Series A-1
Preferred Stock to be converted to the Conversion and Dividend Disbursing
Agent;

 

(C) if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents; and

 

(D) if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes or duties, if any.

 

(the day on which the Holder complies with such requirements, the "Optional
Conversion Date" or the "Fundamental Change Conversion Date", as the case may
be); provided that, the Fundamental Change Conversion Date shall be a date no
earlier than the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change and no later than
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last day of the Fundamental
Change Conversion Period.

 



19 The issuance by the Corporation of shares of Common Stock upon an Optional
Conversion shall be deemed effective immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New York
City time, on the Optional Conversion Date.

(d) With respect to any Optional Conversion or any Fundamental Change
Conversion of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock:

(i) if there shall have been surrendered certificate or certificates, as the
case may be, representing a greater number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred
Stock than the number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock to be converted,
the Corporation shall execute and the Registrar shall countersign and deliver
to such Holder or such Holders designee, at the expense of the Corporation,
new certificate or certificates, as the case may be, representing the number
of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock that shall not have been converted;
and

(ii) if the shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock converted are held in book-
entry form through the facilities of the Depositary, promptly following the
relevant Optional Conversion Date or Fundamental Change Conversion Date, as
the case may be, the Corporation shall cause the Transfer Agent and Registrar
to reduce the number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock represented by
the global certificate by making a notation on Schedule I attached to the
relevant Global Preferred Share.

 

Section 9. Reservation of Common Stock.

 

(a) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its
authorized and unissued shares of Common stock, solely for issuance, the full
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon payment of accrued and unpaid
dividends and upon conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock at the Maximum
Conversion Rate then in effect.

 

(b) All shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Series A-1
Preferred Stock shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable, free and clear of all liens, claims, charges, security interests
and other encumbrances (other than liens, claims, charges, security interests
and other encumbrances created by the Holders).

 

(c) Prior to the delivery of any securities that the Corporation shall be
obligated to deliver upon conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, the
Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all federal
and state laws and regulations thereunder, if any, requiring the registration
of such securities with, or any approval of or consent to the delivery thereof
by, any governmental authority.

(d) The Corporation hereby covenants and agrees that, if at any time the
Common Stock shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or any other
national securities exchange or automated quotation system, the Corporation
shall, if permitted by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation
system, list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed
on such exchange or automated quotation system, all Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and payment of dividends thereon,
if any; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the rules of such exchange
or automated quotation system permit the

 



20  Corporation to defer the listing of such Common Stock until the first
conversion of Series A-1 Preferred Stock into Common Stock in accordance with
the provisions hereof, the Corporation covenants to list such Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock in accordance with
the requirements of such exchange or automated quotation system at such time.

 

Section 10. Fractional Shares.

 

(a) No fractional shares of Common Stock or any other common stock or ADRs
included in the Exchange Property shall be issued to Holders, including as a
result of any conversion of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock or as a
result of any payment of dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock in shares
of Common Stock or Units of Exchange Property.

 

(b) In lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock or any other common stock
or ADRs included in the Exchange Property otherwise issuable upon Mandatory
Conversion, Optional Conversion or Fundamental Change Conversion (including in
connection with a dividend payment), that Holder shall be entitled to receive
an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) based on the VWAP per
share of Common Stock, or, if applicable, such other common stock or ADR, on
the Trading Day immediately preceding the applicable Conversion Date.

 

(c) If more than one share of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock is surrendered
for conversion at one time by or for the same Holder, the number of full
shares of Common Stock, or, if applicable, other common stock or full ADRs,
issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the
aggregate number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock so surrendered for
conversion. If the Corporation pays dividends in Common Stock, other common
stock or ADRs pursuant to Section 4(b) on more than one share of Series A-1
Preferred Stock held at any one time by or for the same Holder, the number of
full shares of Common Stock, or, if applicable, other common stock or full
ADRs, payable in connection with such dividend shall be computed on the basis
of the aggregate number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock so surrendered
for conversion.

 

Section 11. Conversion Rate Adjustments to the Fixed Conversion Rates.

 

(a) Each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time as follows:

 

(i) If the Corporation issues Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to
all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, or if the Corporation
effects a subdivision or combination (including, without limitation, a stock
split or a reverse stock split) of the Common Stock, each Fixed Conversion
Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:

 



   ![LOGO](g214152stp078.jpg) 

where,

 



21 CR0 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution or
immediately prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the effective date for
such subdivision or combination, as the case may be;

 

CR1 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately after 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on such Record Date or immediately after 9:00 a.m., New York
City time, on such effective date, as the case may be;

OS0 = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Record Date or immediately prior to
9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such effective date, as the case may be
(and prior to giving effect to such event); and

OS1 = the number of shares of Common Stock that would be outstanding
immediately after, and solely as a result of, such dividend, distribution,
subdivision or combination.

 

Any adjustment made under this Section 11(a)(i) shall become effective
immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date for such
dividend or distribution, or immediately after 9:00 a.m., New York City time,
on the effective date for such subdivision or combination, as the case may be.
If any dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination of the type
described in this clause (i) is declared but not so paid or made, each Fixed
Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the earlier
of (a) the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay or make such
dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination and (b) the date the
dividend or distribution was to be paid or the date the subdivision or
combination was to have been effective, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that
would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, subdivision
or combination had not been declared.

(ii) If the Corporation issues to all or substantially all holders of the
Common Stock any rights (other than pursuant to any stockholder rights plan),
options or warrants entitling them for a period expiring 60 days or less from
the date of issuance of such rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or
purchase shares of Common Stock at less than the Average VWAP per share of
Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and
including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement for
such issuance, each Fixed Conversion Rate will be increased based on the
following formula:



   ![LOGO](g214152stp079.jpg) 

where,

CR0 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the Record Date for such issuance;

 

CR1 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately after 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on such Record Date;

 



22 OS0 = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Record Date;

X = the number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights,
options or warrants; and

Y = the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, options or
warrants, divided by the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock for the 10
consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day
immediately preceding the date of announcement for such issuance.

 

Any increase in the Fixed Conversion Rates made pursuant to this Section
11(a)(ii) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, on the Record Date for such issuance. To the extent such rights, options
or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or termination, each
Fixed Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date of
such expiration or termination, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then
be in effect had the increase with respect to the issuance of such rights,
options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of
shares of Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights, options or
warrants are not so issued, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be decreased,
effective as of the earlier of (a) the date the Board of Directors determines
not to issue such rights, options or warrants and (b) the date such rights,
options or warrants were to have been issued, to the Fixed Conversion Rate
that would then be in effect if such issuance had not been announced.

 

For purposes of this Section 11(a)(ii), in determining whether any rights,
options or warrants entitle the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase
shares of the Common Stock at less than the Average VWAP per share of Common
Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the
Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement for such issuance,
and in determining the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights,
options or warrants, there shall be taken into account any consideration the
Corporation receives for such rights, options or warrants and any amount
payable on exercise thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other
than cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(iii) If the Corporation pays a dividend or other distribution to all or
substantially all holders of Common Stock of shares of the Corporations
capital stock (other than Common Stock), evidences of the Corporations
indebtedness, the Corporations assets or rights to acquire the capital
stock, indebtedness or assets of the Corporation, excluding:

(1) any dividend, distribution or issuance as to which an adjustment was
effected pursuant to Section 11(a)(i) or Section 11(a)(ii);

(2) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash as to which an
adjustment was effected pursuant to Section 11(a)(iv) below;

(3) Spin-Offs as to which the provisions set forth below in this Section
11(a)(iii) apply; and

(4) any dividends or distributions in connection with a Reorganization Event
that is included in Exchange Property under Section 11(e),

 



23 then each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following
formula:

 



   ![LOGO](g214152stp081.jpg) 

where,

CR0 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution;

 

CR1 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately after 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on such Record Date;

SP0 = the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive
Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately
preceding the Record Date for such dividend or distribution; and

 

FMV = the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors) on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution of shares of
the Corporations capital stock (other than Common Stock), evidences of the
Corporations indebtedness, the Corporations assets or rights to acquire the
capital stock, indebtedness or assets of the Corporation, expressed as an
amount per share of Common Stock.

If the Board of Directors determines the "FMV" (as defined in this Section
11(a)(iii)) of any dividend or other distribution for purposes of this
Section 11(a)(iii) by referring to the actual or when-issued trading market
for any securities, it shall in doing so consider the prices in such market
over the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive
Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately
preceding the Record Date for such dividend or distribution.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "FMV" (as defined in this Section
11(a)(iii)) is equal to or greater than "SP0" (as defined in this Section
11(a)(iii)), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder shall receive, in
respect of each share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, at the same time and upon
the same terms as holders of Common Stock, the amount and kind of shares of
the Corporations capital stock (other than Common Stock), evidences of the
Corporations indebtedness, the Corporations assets or rights to acquire the
capital stock, indebtedness or assets of the Corporation that such Holder
would have received if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock
equal to the Maximum Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to 5:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on the Record Date for such dividend or other
distribution.

Any increase made under the portion of this Section 11(a)(iii) above shall
become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
Record Date for such dividend or other distribution. If such dividend or
distribution is not so paid or made, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be
decreased, effective as of the earlier of (a) the date the Board of Directors
determines not to pay the dividend or other distribution and (b) the date such
dividend or distribution was to have been paid, to the Fixed Conversion Rate
that would then be in effect if the dividend or other distribution had not
been declared.

 



24 If the transaction that gives rise to an adjustment pursuant to this Section
11(a)(iii) is one pursuant to which the payment of a dividend or other
distribution on the Common Stock consists of shares of capital stock of, or
similar equity interests in, a Subsidiary or other business unit of the
Corporation (a "Spin-Off) that are, or, when issued, will be, traded on a
U.S. national securities exchange or a reasonably comparable non-U.S.
equivalent, then each Fixed Conversion Rate shall instead be increased based
on the following formula:

 



   ![LOGO](g214152stp082.jpg) 

where,

CR0 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Ex-Dividend
Date for such dividend or distribution;

 

CR1 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately after 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and
including, the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution;

FMV0 = the Average VWAP per share of such capital stock or similar equity
interests distributed to holders of the Common Stock applicable to one share
of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and
including, the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution; and

MP0 = the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive
Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date for such
dividend or distribution.

 

The adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate under the immediately preceding
paragraph shall occur at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the 10th
consecutive Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Ex-Dividend
Date for such dividend or distribution, but will be given effect as of 9:00
a.m., New York City time, on the date immediately following the Record Date
for such dividend or distribution. The Corporation shall delay the settlement
of any conversion of shares of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock if the
Conversion Date occurs after the Record Date for such dividend or distribution
and prior to the end of such 10 consecutive Trading Day period. In such
event, the Corporation shall deliver the shares of Common Stock issuable in
respect of such conversion (based on the adjusted Fixed Conversion Rates as
described above) on the first Business Day immediately following the last
Trading Day of such 10 consecutive Trading Day period.

For purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii) (and subject in all respects to
Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii)):

(A) rights, options or warrants distributed by the Corporation to all
or substantially all holders of the Common Stock entitling them to subscribe
for or purchase shares

 



25  of the Corporations capital stock, including Common Stock (either initially
or under certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until the
occurrence of a specified event or events ("Trigger Event"):

(i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of the Common Stock;

 

(ii) are not exercisable; and

 

(iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of the Common Stock,
shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section
11(a)(iii) (and no adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates under this Section
11(a)(iii) shall be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger
Event, whereupon such rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to have
been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the
Fixed Conversion Rates shall be made under this Section 11(a)(iii).

 

(B) If any such right, option or warrant, including any such existing rights,
options or warrants distributed prior to the Issue Date, are subject to
events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, options or warrants become
exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or
other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall
be deemed to be the date of distribution and Record Date with respect to new
rights, options or warrants with such rights (in which case the existing
rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to terminate and expire on such
date without exercise by any of the holders thereof).

(C) In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of
rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type
described in the immediately preceding clause (B)) with respect thereto that
was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an
adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates under this clause (iii) was made:

(1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have
been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, upon
such final redemption or repurchase (x) the Fixed Conversion Rates shall be
readjusted as if such rights, options or warrants had not been issued and (y)
the Fixed Conversion Rates shall then again be readjusted to give effect to
such distribution, deemed distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be,
as though it were a cash distribution pursuant to Section 11(a)(iv), equal to
the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders
of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming
such holder had retained such rights, options or warrants), made to all
holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase; and

 

(2) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall have expired or
been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Fixed Conversion
Rates shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been
issued.

For purposes of Section 11(a)(i), Section 11(a)(ii) and this Section
11(a)(iii), if any dividend or distribution to which this Section 11(a)(iii)
is applicable includes one or both of:

 

(A) a dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock to which Section
11(a)(i)is applicable (the "Clause A Distribution"); or 

(B) an issuance of rights, options or warrants to which Section 11(a)(ii) is
applicable (the "Clause B Distribution"),

 



26 then:

 

(1) such dividend or distribution, other than the Clause A Distribution and
the Clause B Distribution, shall be deemed to be a dividend or distribution
to which this Section 11(a)(iii) is applicable (the "Clause C Distribution")
and any Fixed Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 11(a)(iii)
with respect to such Clause C Distribution shall then be made; and

 

(2) the Clause A Distribution and Clause B Distribution shall be deemed to
immediately follow the Clause C Distribution and any Fixed Conversion Rate
adjustment required by Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii) with respect
thereto shall then be made, except that, if determined by the Corporation (I)
the "Record Date" of the Clause A Distribution and the Clause B Distribution
shall be deemed to be the Record Date of the Clause C Distribution and (II)
any shares of Common Stock included in the Clause A Distribution or Clause B
Distribution shall be deemed not to be "outstanding immediately prior to
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Record Date or immediately prior to
9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such effective date" within the meaning of
Section 11(a)(i) or "outstanding immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, on such Record Date" within the meaning of Section 11(a)(ii).

(iv) If the Corporation pays a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to
all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, each Fixed Conversion
Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
       ![LOGO](g214152stp084.jpg)  |  |

where,

 |  | 
 

CR0 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the Record Date for such distribution;

 

CR1 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately after 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the Record Date for such distribution;

SP0 = the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive
Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately
preceding the Record Date for such distribution; and

 

C = an amount of cash per share of Common Stock that the Corporation
distributes to holders of the Common Stock.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "C" (as defined in this Section 11(a)(iv))
is equal to or greater than "SP0" (as defined in this Section 11(a)(iv)), in
lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder shall receive, in respect of each
share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, at the same time and upon the same terms
as holders of shares of Common Stock, the amount of cash that such Holder
would have received if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock
equal to the Maximum Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to 5:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on the Record Date for such distribution.

 



27 Any adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates pursuant to this Section
11(a)(iv) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, on the Record Date for such distribution. If such distribution is not so
paid, the Fixed Conversion Rates shall be decreased, effective as of the
earlier of (a) the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such
dividend and (b) the date such dividend was to have been paid, to the Fixed
Conversion Rates that would then be in effect if such distribution had not
been declared.

 

(v) If the Corporation or one or more of its Subsidiaries purchases Common
Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer (except as provided in
Section 11(c)(iii)) and the cash and value of any other consideration included
in the payment per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds
the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading
Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the
last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or
exchange offer (the "Expiration Date"), each Fixed Conversion Rate shall
be increased based on the following formula:



   ![LOGO](g214152stp085.jpg) 

where,

 

CR0 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and
including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date;

CR1 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately after 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and including,
the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date;

FMV = the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors) as of the Expiration Date of the aggregate value of all cash and
any other consideration paid or payable for shares of the Common Stock validly
tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Date (the
"Purchased Shares");

 

OS1 = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the last time
tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer
(the "Expiration Time"), less any Purchased Shares;

OS0 = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the Expiration Time,
including any Purchased Shares; and

 

SP1 = the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive
Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next
succeeding the Expiration Date.

The adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate under this Section 11(a)(v)
shall occur at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the tenth consecutive Trading
Day immediately following,

 



28  and including, the Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date,
but will be given effect as of 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the
Expiration Date. The Corporation shall delay the settlement of any conversion
of Series A-1 Preferred Stock if the Conversion Date occurs during such 10
consecutive Trading Day period. In such event, the Corporation shall deliver
the shares of Common Stock issuable in respect of such conversion (based on
the adjusted Fixed Conversion Rates) on the first Business Day immediately
following the last Trading Day of such 10 consecutive Trading Day period.

 

(vi) If the Corporation has in effect a stockholder rights plan while any
shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock remain outstanding, Holders shall
receive, upon a conversion of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, in addition to
Common Stock, rights under the Corporations stockholder rights agreement
unless, prior to such conversion, the rights have expired, terminated or been
redeemed or unless the rights have separated from the Common Stock. If the
rights provided for in the stockholder rights plan have separated from the
Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable stockholder
rights agreement so that Holders would not be entitled to receive any rights
in respect of the Common Stock, if any, that the Corporation is required to
deliver upon conversion of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, each Fixed Conversion
Rate shall be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Corporation had
distributed to all holders of the Common Stock, capital stock (other than
Common Stock), evidences of the Corporations indebtedness, the Corporations
assets or rights to acquire the capital stock, indebtedness or assets of the
Corporation pursuant to Section 11(a)(iii) above, subject to readjustment upon
the subsequent expiration, termination or redemption of the rights. A
distribution of rights pursuant to a stockholder rights plan will not trigger
an adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) or
Section 11(a)(iii) above.

(b) Adjustment for Tax Reasons. The Corporation may make such increases in
each Fixed Conversion Rate, in addition to any other increases required by
this Section 11, if the Board of Directors deems it advisable in order to
avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of the Common Stock resulting
from any dividend or distribution of the Corporations shares (or issuance of
rights or warrants to acquire shares) or from any event treated as such for
income tax purposes or for any other reasons; provided that the
same proportionate adjustment must be made to each Fixed Conversion Rate. If
any adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rate is treated as a distribution to
any Non-U.S. Holder which is subject to withholding tax, the Corporation (or
Transfer Agent or any paying agent on behalf of the Corporation) may set off
any withholding tax that is required to be collected with respect to such
deemed distribution against cash payments and other distributions otherwise
deliverable to such Non-U.S. Holder.

 

(c) Calculation of Adjustments; Adjustments to Threshold Appreciation Price,
Initial Price, Applicable Market Value and Five-Day Average VWAP. 

(i) All required calculations will be made to the nearest cent or 1/10,000th
of a share.

 

If an adjustment is made to the Fixed Conversion Rates pursuant to this
Section 11, an inversely proportional adjustment shall also be made (x) to
the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Initial Price solely for purposes of
determining which of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the definition of
Conversion Rate shall apply on the Mandatory Conversion Date (subject to 

 



29  postponement as described in Section 5(a)), and (y) to the Floor Price. Such
adjustment shall be made by dividing each of the Threshold Appreciation Price
and the Initial Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be either
Fixed Conversion Rate immediately after such adjustment pursuant to clause
(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of Section 11(a) or Section 11(b) and the
denominator of which shall be such Fixed Conversion Rate immediately before
such adjustment. The Corporation shall make appropriate adjustments to the
VWAP per share of Common Stock used to calculate the Applicable Market Value
or the Five-Day Average VWAP, as the case may be, to account for
any adjustments to the Fixed Conversion Rates that became effective during
the period in which the Applicable Market Value or the Five-Day Average VWAP,
as the case may be, is being calculated.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding Section 11(a), no adjustment to the Fixed Conversion
Rates shall be made if Holders participate in the transaction that would
otherwise require an adjustment (other than in the case of a share split or
share combination), at the same time, upon the same terms and otherwise on the
same basis as holders of the Common Stock and solely as a result of holding
shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, as if such Holders held a number of
shares of Common Stock equal to the Maximum Conversion Rate as of the Record
Date for such transaction, multiplied by the number of shares of Series A-1
Preferred Stock held by such Holders.

(iii) The Fixed Conversion Rates shall not be adjusted except as provided
herein. Without limiting the foregoing, the Fixed Conversion Rates shall not
be adjusted for:

(A) the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or
future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on
the Corporations securities and the investment of additional optional amounts
in the Common Stock under any plan;

 

(B) the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to
purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or
consultant benefit plan, employee agreement or arrangement or program of the
Corporation or any Subsidiaries of the Corporation;

 

(C) the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option,
warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security
outstanding as of the Issue Date;

(D) a change solely in the par value of the Common Stock;

 

(E) stock repurchases that are not tender offers, including structured or
derivative transactions;

 

(F) as a result of a tender offer solely to holders of fewer than 100 shares
of Common Stock;

 

(G) a third-party tender or exchange offer; or

 

(H) the payment of dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, whether in
cash or in shares of Common Stock.

 

(iv) The Corporation shall have the power to resolve any ambiguity and its
action in so doing, as evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors,
shall be final and conclusive unless clearly inconsistent with the intent
hereof.

 



30 (d) Notice of Adjustment. Whenever a Fixed Conversion Rate or the Fundamental
Change Conversion Rate, as applicable, is to be adjusted, the Corporation
shall: (i) compute such adjusted Fixed Conversion Rate or the Fundamental
Change Conversion Rate, as applicable, and prepare and transmit to the
Transfer Agent an Officers Certificate setting forth such adjusted Fixed
Conversion Rate or the Fundamental Change Conversion Rate, as applicable, the
method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail and the facts requiring
such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; (ii) as soon as
practicable following the determination of a revised Fixed Conversion Rate or
Fundamental Change Conversion Rate, as applicable, provide, or cause to be
provided, a written notice to Holders of the occurrence of such event and
(iii) as soon as practicable following the determination of a revised Fixed
Conversion Rate or Fundamental Change Conversion Rate, as applicable, provide,
or cause to be provided, to Holders a statement setting forth in reasonable
detail the method by which the adjustment to such Fixed Conversion Rate or
the Fundamental Change Conversion Rate, as applicable, was determined and
setting forth such revised Fixed Conversion Rate or Fundamental Change
Conversion Rate, as applicable.

 

(e) Recapitalizations, Reclassifications and Changes of the Common Stock. In
the event of:

 

(A) any recapitalization, reclassification or change of the Common Stock
(other than changes only in par value or resulting from a subdivision or
combination);

(B) any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another Person
or any statutory exchange or binding share exchange; or

(C) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of all
or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation and its
Subsidiaries;

in each case as a result of which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged
for, or converted into, other securities, property or assets (including cash
or any combination thereof) (any such event, a "Reorganization Event"), then,
at the effective time of such Reorganization Event, each share of Series A-1
Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization Event
shall, without the consent of Holders, become convertible into the kind and
amount of such other securities, property or assets (including cash or any
combination thereof) that holders of the Common Stock received in such
Reorganization Event (the "Exchange Property"), and, at the effective time of
such Reorganization Event, the Corporation shall amend its Certificate of
Incorporation to provide for such change in the convertibility of the Series
A-1 Preferred Stock; provided that if the kind and amount of Exchange Property
receivable upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each share of
Common Stock held immediately prior to such 

 



31  Reorganization Event by a Person, then the Exchange Property receivable upon
such Reorganization Event shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the
types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of the Common
Stock that affirmatively make an election with respect to the kind and amount
of Exchange Property so receivable (or of all such holders if none makes an
election). The Conversion Rate then in effect shall be applied on the
applicable Conversion Date to the amount of such Exchange Property received
per share of Common Stock in the Reorganization Event (a "Unit of Exchange
Property"), as determined in accordance with this Section 11(e). For
the purpose of determining which clause of the definition of Conversion Rate
shall apply on the Mandatory Conversion Date (subject to postponement as
described in Section 5(a)) and for the purpose of calculating the Conversion
Rate if clause (ii) of the definition thereof is applicable, the value of a
Unit of Exchange Property shall be determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors, except that if a Unit of Exchange Property includes common stock or
American Depositary Receipts ("ADRs") that are traded on a U.S. national
securities exchange, the value of such common stock or ADRs shall be the
Applicable Market Value determined with regard to a share of such common stock
or a single ADR, as the case may be (or for the purpose of determining the
Stock Price on a Fundamental Change Conversion Date, the value of such common
stock or ADRs shall be the Five-Day Average VWAP determined with regard to a
share of such common stock or a single ADR, as the case may be). For the
purpose of paying accrued and unpaid dividends in Units of Exchange Property
in accordance with Section 4, the value of a Unit of Exchange Property shall
equal 97% of the value determined pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence. 

The above provisions of this Section 11(e) shall similarly apply to successive
Reorganization Events and the provisions of Section 11(a)-(d) shall apply to
any shares of capital stock of the Corporation (or of any successor) received
by the holders of Common Stock in any such Reorganization Event.

 

The amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation providing that the Series
A-1 Preferred Stock shall be convertible into Exchange Property shall also
provide for anti-dilution and other adjustments that are as nearly equivalent
as possible to the adjustments described under this Section 11. The
Corporation shall not become a party to any Reorganization event unless the
terms of such transaction are consistent with this Section 11(e).

The Corporation (or any successor) shall, as soon as reasonably practicable
(but in any event within five Business Days) after the occurrence of any
Reorganization Event, provide written notice to the Holders of such occurrence
of such Reorganization Event and of the kind and amount of the cash,
securities or other property that constitute the Exchange Property. Failure
to deliver such notice shall not affect the operation of this Section 11(e).

(f) For purposes of this Section 11, the number of shares of Common Stock at
any time outstanding shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip
certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.

 

Section 12. Liquidation Rights.

 

(a) Voluntary or Involuntary Liquidation. In the event of any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether
voluntary or involuntary, each Holder

 



32  shall be entitled to receive for each share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock,
out of the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof (whether capital or
surplus) available for distribution to stockholders of the Corporation,
subject to the rights of any creditors of the Corporation, before any payment
or distribution of such assets or proceeds is made to or set aside for the
holders of Common Stock and any other Junior Stock of the Corporation,
payment in full in an amount equal to the sum of (x) the Initial Liquidation
Preference and (y) an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends on each
share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, whether or not declared, to (but
not including) the date fixed for liquidation, dissolution or winding up
(such amounts collectively, the "Liquidation Preference").

 

(b) Partial Payment. If in any distribution described in Section 12(a) the
assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay in
full the amounts payable with respect to all outstanding shares of Series A-1
Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock as to such distribution, Holders and the
holders of such Parity Stock shall share ratably in any such distribution
in proportion to the full accrued and unpaid respective distributions to
which they are entitled.

(c) Residual Distributions. After payment of the full amount of the
Liquidation Preference, including an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid
dividends, to which they are entitled, Holders will have no right or claim to
any of the remaining assets of the Corporation (or proceeds thereof). 

(d) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation. For purposes of
this Section 12, the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into
any other corporation or other entity, or the sale, lease or exchange (for
cash, securities or other property) of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Corporation, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation.

Section 13. No Sinking Fund. The Series A-1 Preferred Stock will not be
subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar
provisions.

Section 14. Status of Converted or Repurchased Shares. Shares of Series
A-1 Preferred Stock that are duly converted in accordance herewith or
repurchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall revert to
authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, undesignated as to series
and available for future issuance; provided that any such cancelled shares of
Series A-1 Preferred Stock may be reissued only as shares of any series of
Preferred Stock other than Series A-1 Preferred Stock.

 

Section 15. Voting Rights.

(a) General. Holders shall not have any voting rights in respect of their
shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock except as set forth below or as otherwise
from time to time required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation. Except
as provided herein with respect to voting rights allocated pro rata with
other classes or series of Parity Stock based on the liquidation preference of
each such class or series, Holders will be entitled to one vote for each such
share on any matter on which Holders are entitled to vote, including any
action by written consent.

 



33 (b) Preferred Directors. Whenever, at any time or times, dividends payable on
the shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock have not been paid for an aggregate
of six or more Dividend Periods, whether or not consecutive (an "Event of Non-
payment"), the Holders will have the right, with holders of shares of any one
or more other classes or series of outstanding Parity Stock upon which like
voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable at the time, voting
together as a class (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the
liquidation preference of each such class or series), to elect two directors
(together, the "Preferred Directors" and each, a "Preferred Director") at the
next annual meeting or special meeting of the Corporations stockholders and
at each subsequent annual meeting or special meeting of the Corporations
stockholders until all accrued and unpaid dividends have been paid in full or
fully set aside for payment on Series A-1 Preferred Stock, at which time such
right will terminate, except as otherwise provided herein or expressly
provided by law, subject to reverting in the event of each and every Event of
Non-payment; provided that it will be a qualification for election for any
Preferred Director that the election of such Preferred Director will not
cause the Corporation to violate any corporate governance requirements of any
securities exchange or other trading facility on which the Corporations
securities may then be listed or traded that listed or traded
companies, including that the Corporation have a majority of independent
directors.

Upon any termination of the right set forth in the immediately preceding
paragraph, the Preferred Directors shall cease to be qualified as directors,
the term of office of all Preferred Directors then in office shall terminate
immediately and the authorized number of directors shall be reduced by the
number of Preferred Directors elected as described above.

Any Preferred Director may be removed at any time, with or without cause, and
any vacancy created thereby may be filled, only at a meeting of the
Corporations stockholders at which this is a permitted action by the
affirmative vote of the Holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of
Series A-1 Preferred Stock at the time outstanding voting separately as a
class together with the holders of shares of Parity Stock upon which like
voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable at the time (and with
voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each
such class or series), to the extent the voting rights of such Holders
described above are then exercisable. If the office of any Preferred Director
becomes vacant for any reason other than removal from office as described
above, the remaining Preferred Director may choose a successor who will hold
office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred.

 

At any time after the right of Holders to elect Preferred Directors has become
vested and is continuing but a meeting of the Corporations stockholders to
elect such Preferred Directors has not yet been held, or if a vacancy shall
exist in the office of any such Preferred Director that has not been filled by
the remaining Preferred Director, the Board of Directors may, but shall not
be required to, call a special meeting of Holders and the holders of any one
or more classes or series of outstanding Parity Stock upon which like voting
rights have been conferred and are exercisable at the time, for the
purpose of electing the Preferred Directors that such Holders and holders are
entitled to elect; provided that in the event the Board of Directors does not
call such special meeting, such election will be held at the next annual
meeting. At any such meeting held for the purpose of electing such Preferred
Director or Preferred Directors, as the case may be, (whether at an annual
meeting or special meeting), the presence in person or by proxy of the Holders
and holders of shares representing at least a majority of the voting power of

 



34  the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock having similar voting
rights shall be required to constitute a quorum of the Series A-1 Preferred
Stock and any Parity Stock having similar voting rights. The affirmative vote
of Holders and the holders of any Parity Stock having similar voting rights
constituting a majority of the voting power of such shares present at such
meeting, in person or by proxy, shall be sufficient to elect any such
Preferred Director.

(c) Voting Rights as to Particular Matters. So long as any shares of Series
A-1 Preferred Stock are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent
of stockholders required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the
affirmative vote or consent of the Holders of at least two-thirds in voting
power of the shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock at the time outstanding and
all other Parity Stock having similar voting rights that are exercisable at
the time, voting together as a single class (and with voting rights allocated
pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series),
given in person or by proxy, either by vote at any meeting called for such
purpose, or by written consent in lieu of such meeting, shall be necessary for
effecting or validating:

 

(i) Authorization of Senior Stock. Any amendment or alteration of the
Certificate of Incorporation to authorize or create or increase the
authorized amount of, or any issuance of, any shares of, or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of, any class or
series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking senior to Series A-1
Preferred Stock with respect to either or both the payment of dividends
and/or the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the Corporation ("Senior Stock");

 

(ii) Amendment of Series A-1 Preferred Stock. Any amendment, alteration or
repeal of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation (including,
unless no vote on such merger or consolidation is required by Section
15(c)(iii), any amendment, alteration or repeal by means of a merger,
consolidation or otherwise) so as to adversely affect the rights,
preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock;
or

(iii) Share Exchanges, Reclassifications, Mergers and Consolidations. Any
consummation of a binding share exchange, a reclassification involving the
Series A-1 Preferred Stock, or a merger or consolidation of the Corporation
with or into another corporation or other entity, unless in each case (x)
the Series A-1 Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the case of any
such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not the
surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preference
securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and
(y) the Series A-1 Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such new
preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences,
privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, taken
as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than
the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and
restrictions thereof, of Series A-1 Preferred Stock immediately prior to such
consummation, taken as a whole;

_provided_ , _however_ , that for all purposes of this Section 15(c), the
creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount,
whether pursuant to pre-emptive or similar rights or otherwise, of any series
of Preferred Stock, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or 

 



35  exercisable for any other series of Preferred Stock (including the Series
A-1 Preferred Stock), ranking equally with and/or junior to Series A-1
Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such
dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and the distribution of assets
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation shall not be
deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or
voting powers, and shall not require the affirmative vote or consent of, the
Holders.

(d) Procedures for Voting and Consents. The rules and procedures for calling
and conducting any meeting of Holders (including, without limitation, the
fixing of a record date in connection therewith), the solicitation and use of
proxies at such a meeting, the obtaining of written consents and any
other aspect or matter with regard to such a meeting or such consents shall
be governed by any rules the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may adopt
from time to time, which rules and procedures shall conform to the
requirements of the Certificate of Incorporation, the By-laws, applicable law
and the rules of any national securities exchange or other trading facility on
which the Series A-1 Preferred Stock is listed or traded at the time.

 

Section 16. Record Holders. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
the Corporation and the Transfer Agent may deem and treat the Record Holder
of any share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock as the absolute, true and lawful
owner thereof for all purposes, including, without limitation, for purposes of
making payment and settling conversions, to the fullest extent permitted by
law and neither the Corporation nor the Transfer Agent shall be affected by
any notice to the contrary.

Section 17. Notices. All notices or communications in respect of Series A-1
Preferred Stock shall be sufficiently given if given in writing and delivered
in person or by first class mail, postage prepaid, or if given in such other
manner as may be permitted in the Certificate of Incorporation, the By-laws
or by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if shares of Series A-1
Preferred Stock are issued in book-entry form through DTC or any similar
facility, such notices may be given to the Holders in any manner permitted by
such facility.

Section 18. No Pre-emptive Rights; No Redemption Right. No share of Series A-1
Preferred Stock or share of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Series
A-1 Preferred Stock shall have any rights of preemption whatsoever as to any
securities of the Corporation, or any warrants, rights or options issued or
granted with respect thereto, regardless of how such securities, or such
warrants, rights or options, may be designated, issued or granted. The Series
A-1 Preferred Stock are not redeemable.

 

Section 19. Replacement Stock Certificates.

 

(a) If physical certificates are issued, and any of the Series A-1 Preferred
Stock certificates shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Corporation shall, at the expense of the Holder thereof, issue, in exchange
and in substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated Series A-1
Preferred Stock certificate, or in lieu of and substitution for the lost,
stolen or destroyed Series A-1 Preferred Stock certificate, a new Series A-1
Preferred Stock certificate of like tenor and representing an equivalent
amount of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, but only upon receipt of
evidence of such loss, theft or destruction of such Series A-1 Preferred
Stock certificate and indemnity, if requested, satisfactory to the Corporation
and the Transfer Agent.

(b) The Corporation is not required to issue any certificate representing the
Series A-1 Preferred Stock on or after the Mandatory Conversion Date (subject
to postponement as described in Section 5(a)). In lieu of the delivery of a
replacement certificate following the Mandatory Conversion Date (subject to
postponement as described in Section 5(a)), the Transfer Agent, upon delivery
of the evidence and indemnity described in clause (a) above, shall deliver the
shares of Common Stock issuable, along with any other consideration payable
or deliverable, pursuant to the terms of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock
formerly evidenced by the certificate.

 



36 Section 20. Transfer Agent, Registrar, Conversion and Dividend Disbursing
Agent. The duly appointed Transfer Agent, Registrar, conversion and dividend
disbursing agent for the Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be Computershare
Trust Company N.A. The Corporation may, in its sole discretion, remove the
Transfer Agent in accordance with the agreement between the Corporation and
the Transfer Agent; provided that the Corporation shall appoint a successor
transfer agent who shall accept such appointment prior to the effectiveness of
such removal. Upon any such removal or appointment, the Corporation shall
send notice thereof by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders.

Section 21. Form.

 

(a) The Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be issued in the form of one or more
permanent global shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock in definitive, fully
registered form eligible for book-entry settlement with the global legend (the
"Global Shares Legend") as set forth on the form of Series A-1 Preferred Stock
certificate attached hereto as Schedule G (each, a "Global Preferred Share"),
which is hereby incorporated in and expressly made part of this Certificate of
Incorporation. The Global Preferred Shares may have notations, legends or
endorsements required by law, stock exchange rules, agreements to which the
Corporation is subject, if any, or usage (provided that any such notation,
legend or endorsement is in a form acceptable to the Corporation). The Global
Preferred Shares shall be deposited on behalf of the Holders represented
thereby with the Registrar, at its New York office as custodian for DTC (the
"Depositary"), and registered in the name of the Depositary or a nominee of
the Depositary, duly executed by the Corporation and countersigned and
registered by the Registrar as hereinafter provided. The aggregate number of
shares represented by each Global Preferred Share may from time to time be
increased or decreased by adjustments made on the records of the Registrar and
the Depositary or its nominee as hereinafter provided.

This Section 21(a) shall apply only to a Global Preferred Share deposited with
or on behalf of the Depositary. The Corporation shall execute and the
Registrar shall, in accordance with this Section 21(a), countersign and
deliver any Global Preferred Shares that (i) shall be registered in the name
of Cede and Co. or other nominee of the Depositary and (ii) shall be delivered
by the Registrar to Cede and Co. or pursuant to instructions received from Cede
and Co. or held by the Registrar as custodian for the Depositary pursuant to an
agreement between the Depositary and the Registrar. Members of,
or participants in, the Depositary ("Agent Members") shall have no rights
under this Certificate of Incorporation with respect to any Global Preferred
Share held on their behalf by the Depositary or by the Registrar as the
custodian of the 

 



37  Depositary, or under such Global Preferred Share, and the Depositary may be
treated by the Corporation, the Registrar and any agent of the Corporation or
the Registrar as the absolute owner of such Global Preferred Share for all
purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall
prevent the Corporation, the Registrar or any agent of the Corporation or the
Registrar from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other
authorization furnished by the Depositary or impair, as between the Depositary
and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices of the Depositary
governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of a beneficial interest
in any Global Preferred Share. The Holder of the Global Preferred Shares may
grant proxies or otherwise authorize any Person to take any action that a
Holder is entitled to take pursuant to the Global Preferred Shares or the
Certificate of Incorporation.

Owners of beneficial interests in Global Preferred Shares shall not be
entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated shares of Series A-1
Preferred Stock, unless (x) the Depositary notifies the Corporation that it is
unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the Global Preferred Shares
and the Corporation does not appoint a qualified replacement for the
Depositary within 90 days or (y) the Depositary ceases to be a "clearing
agency" registered under the Exchange Act and the Corporation does not appoint
a qualified replacement for the Depositary within 90 days. In any such case,
the Global Preferred Shares shall be exchanged in whole for definitive stock
certificates that are not issued in global form, with the same terms and of an
equal aggregate Liquidation Preference, and such definitive stock
certificates shall be registered in the name or names of the Person or
Persons specified by the Depositary in a written instrument to the Registrar.

 

(b) Signature. Two Officers permitted by applicable law shall sign each Global
Preferred Share for the Corporation, in accordance with the Corporations
Bylaws and applicable law, by manual or facsimile signature. If an Officer
whose signature is on a Global Preferred Share no longer holds that office at
the time the Registrar countersigned such Global Preferred Share, such
Global Preferred Share shall be valid nevertheless. A Global Preferred Share
shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Registrar manually
countersigns such Global Preferred Share. Each Global Preferred Share shall be
dated the date of its countersignature. The foregoing paragraph shall
likewise apply to any certificate representing shares of Series A-1 Preferred
Stock.

 

Section 22. Stock Transfer and Stamp Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and
all stock transfer and documentary stamp taxes that may be payable in respect
of any issuance or delivery of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock or shares
of Common Stock or other securities issued on account of Series A-1 Preferred
Stock pursuant hereto or certificates representing such shares or securities.
The Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any such tax that may
be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of
shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock or Common Stock or other securities in a
name other than that in which the shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock with
respect to which such shares or other securities are issued or delivered were
registered, or in respect of any payment to any Person other than a payment to
the Holder thereof, and shall not be required to make any such issuance,
delivery or payment unless and until the Person otherwise entitled to such
issuance, delivery or payment has paid to the Corporation the amount of any
such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



38 Section 23. Listing. The Corporation hereby covenants and agrees that, if its
listing application for the Series A-1 Preferred Stock is approved, upon such
listing, the Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep the
Series A-1 Preferred Stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

 

If the Global Preferred Share or Global Preferred Shares, as the case maybe,
or the Series A-1 Preferred Stock represented thereby shall be listed on the
New York Stock Exchange or any other stock exchange, the Depositary may, with
the written approval of the Corporation, appoint a registrar (acceptable to
the Corporation) for registration of such Global Preferred Share or
Global Preferred Shares, as the case may be, or the Series A-1 Preferred
Stock represented thereby in accordance with the requirements of such
exchange. Such registrar (which may be the Registrar if so permitted by the
requirements of such exchange) may be removed and a substitute registrar
appointed by the Registrar upon the request or with the written approval of
the Corporation. If the Global Preferred Share or Global Preferred Shares, as
the case may be or the Series A-1 Preferred Stock represented thereby are
listed on one or more other stock exchanges, the Registrar will, at the
request and expense of the Corporation, arrange such facilities for the
delivery, transfer, surrender and exchange of such Global Preferred Share
or Global Preferred Shares, as the case may be, or the Series A-1 Preferred
Stock represented thereby as may be required by law or applicable stock
exchange regulations.

 

Section 24. Ranking. Notwithstanding anything in this Certificate of
Incorporation to the contrary, the Series A-1 Preferred Stock will,
with respect to dividend rights or rights upon the liquidation, winding-up or
dissolution of the Corporation rank (i) senior to any Junior Stock, (ii) on
parity with any Parity Stock and (iii) junior to any Senior Stock and the
Corporations existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables).

Section 25. Other Rights. The shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall
not have any rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers or relative,
participating, optional or other special rights, or qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereof, other than as set forth herein or in the
Certificate of Incorporation or as provided by applicable law.

AMENDED AND RESTATED BY-LAWS

As amended and restated effective [●]

ARTICLE I

 

MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

 

Section 1.01. _Annual Meetings_. The annual meeting of the stockholders of
Envision Healthcare Corporation (the " _Corporation_ ") for the election of
directors to succeed directors whose terms expire and for the transaction of
such other business as properly may come before such meeting shall be held
each year either within or without the State of Delaware, on such date and at
such place, if any, and time as exclusively may be fixed from time to time by
resolution of the Corporations Board of Directors (the " _Board_ ") and set
forth in the notice or waiver of notice of the meeting. In lieu of holding an
annual meeting of the stockholders at a designated place, the Board may, in
its sole discretion, determine that any annual meeting of stockholders may be
held solely by means of remote communication. The Board may postpone,
reschedule or cancel any annual meeting of stockholders previously scheduled
by the Board.

Section 1.02. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the stockholders of the
Corporation may be called only in the manner set forth in the Second Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, as amended from
time to time (the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ "). Notice of every
special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall state the purpose
or purposes of such meeting. Except as otherwise required by law, the business
conducted at a special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation shall be
limited exclusively to the business set forth in the Corporations notice of
meeting, and the individual or group calling such meeting shall have exclusive
authority to determine the business included in such notice. Any special
meeting of the stockholders shall be held either within or without the State
of Delaware, at such place, if any, and on such date and time, as shall be
specified in the notice of such special meeting. In lieu of holding a special
meeting of the stockholders at a designated place, the Board may, in its sole
discretion, determine that any special meeting of stockholders may be held
solely by means of remote communication.

 

Section 1.03. Participation in Meetings by Remote Communication. For the
purposes of these Bylaws, if authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole
discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of
Directors may adopt, stockholders and proxyholders may, by means of remote
communication:

 

(a) participate in a meeting of stockholders; and

 

(b) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders whether
such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote
communication, provided that (i) the Corporation shall implement reasonable
measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at
the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or
proxyholder, (ii) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to
provide such stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the meeting and to

 



1  vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to
read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with
such proceedings, and (iii) if any stockholder or proxyholder votes or takes
other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such
vote or other action shall be maintained by the Corporation.

 

Section 1.04. _Notice of Meetings; Waiver of Notice_.

 

(a) Unless otherwise required by law, the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary
shall cause notice of each meeting of stockholders to be given in a manner
permitted by the DGCL not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days prior to the
meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting,
subject to such exclusions as are then permitted by the DGCL. The notice shall
specify ( _i_ ) the place, if any, date and time of such meeting, ( _ii_ )
the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and
proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, (
_iii_ ) the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at
the meeting, (iv) in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes
for which such meeting is called, and ( _v_ ) such other information as may be
required by law or as may be deemed appropriate by the Chairman of the Board,
Secretary or the Board. If the stockholder list referred to in Section 1.06 of
these Amended and Restated By-laws (the " _By-laws_ ") is made accessible on
an electronic network, the notice of meeting must indicate how the
stockholder list can be accessed. If the meeting of stockholders is to be held
solely by means of electronic communications, the notice of meeting must
provide the information required to access such stockholder list during the
meeting.

(b) Notice to stockholders may be given by personal delivery, mail, or, with
the consent of the stockholder entitled to receive notice, by facsimile or
other means of electronic transmission. If mailed, such notice shall be
delivered by postage prepaid envelope directed to each stockholder at such
stockholders address as it appears in the records of the Corporation and
shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States mail. Notice given
by electronic transmission pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed given:
(i) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a
facsimile telecommunication number at which the stockholder has consented to
receive notice; (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic
mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (iii)
if by posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the
stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and
(B) the giving of such separate notice; and (iv) if by any other form of
electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. An affidavit of
the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other
agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given by personal delivery,
by mail, or by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of
fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

(c) A written waiver of notice of meeting signed by a stockholder or a waiver
by electronic transmission by a stockholder, whether given before or after the
meeting time stated in such notice, is deemed equivalent to notice. Neither
the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or
special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in a waiver of notice.
Attendance of a stockholder at a meeting is a waiver of notice of such
meeting, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose
of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any
business at the meeting on the ground that the meeting is not lawfully called
or convened.

 



2 Section 1.05. _Proxies_.

 

(a) Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to
express consent to or dissent from corporate action may, in writing without a
meeting, authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as
proxy.

(b) A stockholder may authorize a valid proxy by executing a written
instrument signed by such stockholder, or by causing his or her signature to
be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means, including but not limited
to by facsimile signature, or by transmitting or authorizing an electronic
transmission (as defined in Section 8.08 of these By-laws) setting forth an
authorization to act as proxy for the person designated as the holder of the
proxy, a proxy solicitation firm or a like authorized agent. Proxies by
electronic transmission must either set forth, or be submitted with,
information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission
was authorized by the stockholder. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or
other reliable reproduction of a writing or transmission created pursuant to
this section may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or
transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or
transmission could be used if such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other
reproduction is a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or
transmission.

(c) No proxy may be voted or acted upon after the expiration of three years
from the date of such proxy, unless such proxy provides for a longer period.
Every proxy is revocable at the pleasure of the stockholder executing it
unless the proxy states that it is irrevocable and applicable law makes it
irrevocable. A stockholder may revoke any proxy that is not irrevocable by
attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in
writing revoking the proxy or by filing another duly executed proxy bearing a
later date with the Secretary.

Section 1.06. _Voting Lists_. The officer of the Corporation who has charge of
the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare, at least 10 days before
every meeting of the stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders
entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order and showing
the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the
name of each stockholder. This list shall be open to the examination of any
stockholder prior to and during the meeting for any purpose germane to the
meeting as required by the DGCL or other applicable law on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, provided the information required to gain
access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting or during
ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the Corporation.
In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an
electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that
such information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation. The
stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders
entitled by this section to examine the list required by this section or to
vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

 

Section 1.07. _Quorum_. Except as otherwise required by law, by the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, the presence in person or by
proxy of the holders of record of a majority in voting power of the
outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at such meeting.

 



3 Section 1.08. _Voting_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or by
applicable law, every holder of record of shares entitled to vote at a
meeting of stockholders is entitled to one vote for each share outstanding in
his or her name on the books of the Corporation ( _i_ ) at the close of
business on the record date for stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting
or ( _ii_ ) if no record date has been fixed, at the close of business on the
day next preceding the day on which notice of the meeting is given, or if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the meeting is held. All matters at any meeting at which a quorum is
present shall be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a
majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of stock present in person
or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject
matter in question, except as otherwise provided in Section 1.08(b) of these
By-laws with respect to the election of directors or unless a different or
minimum vote is required by the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-
laws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the
Corporation, or any law or regulation applicable to the Corporation or its
securities, in which case such different or minimum vote shall be
the applicable vote on the matter.

(b) Each director nominee in an uncontested election of directors (i.e., an
election in which the number of director nominees does not exceed the number
of directors to be elected at the meeting) shall be elected to the Board by
the vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to such director
nominees election. In any contested election of directors (i.e., an election
in which the number of director nominees exceeds the number of directors to be
elected at the meeting), directors shall be elected by a plurality of the
votes cast. For purposes of this section, "a majority of votes cast" means
that the number of shares voted "for" a director nominee must exceed the
number of votes cast "against" that director nominees election. "Abstentions"
and "broker non-votes" shall not be counted as votes cast with respect to a
director nominees election. Following certification of the stockholder vote
in an uncontested election, any incumbent director who did not receive a
majority of votes cast for his or her election shall promptly tender his or
her resignation, contingent upon acceptance of such resignation by the Board
in accordance with this Section 1.08(b), to the Chairman of the Board. The
Chairman of the Board shall inform the Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee of such tender of resignation, and the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee shall consider such resignation and recommend
to the Board whether to accept the tendered resignation or reject it or
whether any other action should be taken. In deciding upon its
recommendation, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall
consider all relevant factors, including without limitation the qualifications
of the director who has tendered his or her resignation and the directors
contribution to the Corporation and the Board. The Board will act on the
recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee no later
than 90 days after the certification of the stockholder vote and disclose
the decision by filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The Board shall consider the factors considered by the
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and such additional information
and factors that the Board deems relevant. An incumbent director who tenders
his or her resignation to the Board pursuant to this Section 1.08(b) will not
participate in the decision of the Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee or the Board. The stockholders do not have the right to cumulate
their votes for the election of directors.

 



4 Section 1.09. _Adjournment_. Any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned from
time to time, by the chairperson of the meeting or by the vote of the holders
of a majority of the shares of stock present in person or represented by proxy
at the meeting, to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need
not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the place, if any, and date and
time thereof (and the means of remote communication, if any, by which
stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote
at such meeting) are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken unless the adjournment is for more than 30 days or a new record date is
fixed for the adjourned meeting after the adjournment, in which case notice of
the adjourned meeting in accordance with Section 1.04 of these By-laws shall
be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. At the
adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any business that might have
been transacted at the original meeting.

 

Section 1.10. _Organization; Procedure; Inspection of Elections_.

 

(a) At every meeting of stockholders the presiding person shall be the
Chairman of the Board or, in the event of his or her absence or disability,
the Chief Executive Officer and President or, in the event of his or her
absence or disability, a presiding person chosen by resolution of the Board.
The Secretary or, in the event of his or her absence or disability, the
Assistant Secretary, if any, or, if there be no Assistant Secretary, in the
absence of the Secretary, an appointee of the presiding person, shall act as
secretary of the meeting. The date and time of the opening and the closing of
the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting
shall be announced at the meeting by the presiding person. The Board may make
such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it
shall deem necessary, appropriate or convenient. Except to the extent
inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board, the
presiding person shall have the right and authority to convene and (for any or
no reason) to recess and/or adjourn the meeting. Subject to any such rules
and regulations of the Board, the presiding person of any meeting shall have
the right and authority to prescribe rules, regulations and procedures for
such meeting and to take all such actions as in the judgment of the
presiding person are appropriate for the proper conduct of such meeting. Such
rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board or prescribed
by the presiding person of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the
following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the
meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and
the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or
participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation,
their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the
presiding person of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to
the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (v)
limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. The
presiding person at any meeting of stockholders, in addition to making any
other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting,
shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a
matter or business was not properly brought before the meeting and if such
presiding person should so determine, such presiding person shall so declare
to the meeting and any such matter of business not properly brought before
the meeting shall not be transacted or considered. Unless and to the extent
determined by the Board or the person presiding over the meeting, meetings of
stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of
parliamentary procedure.

 



5 (b) Preceding any meeting of the stockholders, the Board may, and when
required by law shall, appoint one or more persons to act as inspectors of
elections, and may designate one or more alternate inspectors. If no inspector
or alternate so appointed by the Board is able to act, or if no inspector or
alternate has been appointed and the appointment of an inspector is required
by law, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more
inspectors to act at the meeting. No director or nominee for the office of
director shall be appointed as an inspector of elections. Each inspector,
before entering upon the discharge of the duties of an inspector, shall take
and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict
impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector
or inspectors so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of
shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of
each such share, (ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation
represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii)
count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period
a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the
inspectors, and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of
capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and such
inspectors count of all votes and ballots. The inspectors shall discharge
their duties in accordance with the requirements of applicable law.

principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than ninety (90) days
nor more than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the first anniversary

_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the date of the annual meeting
is advanced by more than thirty (30) days or delayed by more than seventy
(70) days from such anniversary date of the preceding years annual meeting,
notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than

omissions as a stockholder of the Corporation. Notice of a stockholder
nomination or proposal shall also set forth, as to the stockholder giving the
notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or
proposal is made ( _A_ ) a description of any agreement, arrangement or
understanding with respect to the nomination or proposal and/or the voting of

(including, without limitation, regardless of the form of settlement, any
derivative, long or short positions, profit interests, forwards, futures,

any proponent person is a party, the effect or intent of which is to transfer
to or from any proponent person, in whole or in part, any of the economic
consequences of ownership of any security of the Corporation, to increase or
decrease the voting power of any proponent person with respect to

 



7  shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation and/or to provide
any proponent person, directly or indirectly, with the opportunity to profit
or share in any profit derived from, or to otherwise benefit economically
from, any increase or decrease in the value of any security of the Corporation
(a " _Derivative Instrumen_ t"); ( _C_ ) to the extent not disclosed pursuant

required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be
made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the
proposal and/or for the election of directors in an election contest pursuant
to and in accordance with Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. The foregoing notice requirements shall be
deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified the
Corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting
in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, and such stockholders proposal has been included in a proxy
statement that has been prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for
such annual meeting. A stockholder providing notice of a proposed nomination
for election to the Board or other business proposed to be brought before
a meeting (whether given pursuant to this paragraph (a)(ii) or paragraph (b)
of this Section 1.12 of these By-laws) shall update and supplement such notice
from time to time to the extent necessary so that the information provided or
required to be provided in such notice shall be true and correct ( _x_ ) as
of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the
meeting and ( _y_ ) as of the date that is fifteen (15) days prior to the
meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, provided that if the
record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting
is less than fifteen (15) days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the information shall be supplemented and updated as of
such later date. Any such update and supplement shall be delivered in writing
to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not
later than five (5) days after the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting (in the case of any update and
supplement required to be made as of the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting), not later than ten (10) days
prior to the date for the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof
(in the case of any update or supplement required to be made as of fifteen
(15) days prior to the meeting or adjournment or postponement thereof) and not
later than five (5) days after the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, but no later than the date prior
to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof (in the case of any
update and supplement required to be made as of a date less than fifteen (15)
days prior the date of the meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof). The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such
other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility
of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation and to
determine the independence of such director under the Exchange Act and rules
and regulations thereunder and applicable stock exchange rules. In addition, a
stockholder seeking to bring an item of business before the annual meeting
shall promptly provide any other information reasonably requested by the
Corporation.

 



8 (iii) Notwithstanding anything in Section 1.12(a)(ii) of these By-laws to the
contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the
Board at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement
naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the
increased Board made by the Corporation at least one hundred (100) calendar
days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting
(which date shall, for purposes of the Corporations first annual meeting of
stockholders after its shares of common stock are first publicly traded, be
deemed to have occurred on [●] ), then a stockholders notice under this
Section 1.12(a) shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to
nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it is received by
the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later
than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which
such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.

 

(b) _Special Meetings of Stockholders_. Only such business as shall have been
brought before the special meeting of the stockholders pursuant to the
Corporations notice of meeting shall be conducted at such meeting.
Nominations of persons for election to the Board may be made at a special
meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to
the Corporations notice of meeting ( _1_ ) by or at the direction of the
Board or a Committee appointed by the Board for such purpose or ( _2_ )
provided that the Board has determined that directors shall be elected at such
meeting, by any stockholder of the Corporation who is entitled to vote at the
meeting, who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section
1.12(b) and who is a stockholder of record at the time such notice is
delivered to the Secretary and at the date of the meeting. In the event the
Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of
electing one or more directors of the Corporation, any stockholder entitled to
vote at such meeting may nominate a person or persons, as the case may be,
for election to such position(s) as specified by the Corporation, if the
stockholders notice as required by Section 1.12(a)(ii) of these By-laws shall
be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation not earlier than the one hundred and twentieth (120th) day prior
to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later
of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting or the tenth (10th)
day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date
of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board to be elected
at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment
or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend
any time period) for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above.

(c) General. 

(i) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this Section 1.12 shall be eligible to serve as directors and only
such business shall be conducted at an annual or special meeting of
stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this Section. Except as otherwise provided by
applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, the
presiding person of a meeting of stockholders shall have the power and duty (
_x_ ) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought
before the meeting was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this Section 1.12 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if
any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made, solicited (or is part
of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be,
proxies in support of such stockholders

 



9  nominee or proposal in compliance with such stockholders representation as
required by clause (a)(ii)(C)(4) of this Section 1.12), and ( _y_ ) if any
proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this Section 1.12,
to declare that such defective nomination shall be disregarded or that such
proposed business shall not be transacted.

 

(ii) If the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder)
making a nomination or proposal under this Section 1.12 does not appear at a
meeting of stockholders to present such nomination or proposal, the nomination
shall be disregarded and/or the proposed business shall not be transacted, as
the case may be, notwithstanding that proxies in favor thereof may have
been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 1.12, to be
considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be a
duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or authorized
by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission
delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the
meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or
electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or
electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.

(A) Whenever used in these By-laws, " _public announcement_ " shall mean
disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,
Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly
filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant
to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder.

(B) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.12, a
stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set
forth in this Section 1.12. Nothing in this Section 1.12 shall be deemed to
affect any rights of ( _x_ ) stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in
the Corporations proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange
Act or ( _y_ ) the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect
directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation or of the relevant preferred stock certificate of designation.

 

(C) The announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual or special
meeting does not commence a new time period (and does not extend any time
period) for the giving of notice of a stockholder nomination or a stockholder
proposal as described above.

rules and regulations for the

 



13  government of any Committee not inconsistent with the provisions of these
By-laws, including Article XI, and each Committee may adopt its own rules and

17 ARTICLE V

 

CAPITAL STOCK

Section 5.01.  _Certificates of Stock; Uncertificated Shares_. The shares of
the Corporation shall be represented by certificates, except to the extent
that the Board has provided by resolution or resolutions that some or all of
any or all classes or series of the stock of the Corporation shall be
uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares
represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the
Corporation. Every holder of stock in the Corporation represented by
certificates shall be entitled to have, and the Board may in its sole
discretion permit a holder of uncertificated shares to receive upon request, a
certificate signed by the appropriate officers of the Corporation, certifying
the number and class of shares owned by such holder. Such certificate shall
be in such form as the Board may determine, to the extent consistent with
applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation and these By-laws.

 

Section 5.02. _Facsimile Signatures_. Any or all signatures on the
certificates referred to in Section 5.01 of these By-laws may be in facsimile
form. If any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed, or whose
facsimile signature has been placed upon, a certificate shall have ceased to
be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is
issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he or
she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

 

Section 5.03. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. A new certificate may
be issued in place of any certificate theretofore issued by the Corporation
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed only upon delivery to the
Corporation of an affidavit of the owner or owners (or their legal
representatives) of such certificate, setting forth such allegation, and a
bond or other undertaking as may be satisfactory to a financial officer of
the Corporation designated by the Board to indemnify the Corporation against
any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or
destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of any such new
certificate.

Section 5.04. _Transfer of Stock_.

 

(a) Transfer of shares shall be made on the books of the Corporation upon
surrender to the Corporation of a certificate for shares, duly endorsed or
accompanied by appropriate evidence of succession, assignment or authority to
transfer, and otherwise in compliance with applicable law. Shares that are not
represented by a certificate shall be transferred in accordance with
applicable law. Within a reasonable time after the transfer of uncertificated
stock, the Corporation shall send to the registered owner thereof a written
notice containing the information required to be set forth or stated on
certificates pursuant to Sections 151, 156, 202(a) and 218(a) of the DGCL.
Subject to applicable law, the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation
and these By-laws, the Board may prescribe such additional rules and
regulations as it may deem appropriate relating to the issue, transfer and
registration of shares of the Corporation.

(b) The Corporation may enter into agreements with stockholders to restrict
the transfer of stock of the Corporation in any manner not prohibited by the
DGCL.

 



18 Section 5.05. _Registered Stockholders_. Prior to due surrender of a
certificate for registration of transfer, the Corporation may treat the
registered owner as the person exclusively entitled to receive dividends and
other distributions, to vote, to receive notice and otherwise to exercise all
the rights and powers of the owner of the shares represented by such
certificate, and the Corporation shall not be bound to recognize any equitable
or legal claim to or interest in such shares on the part of any other person,
whether or not the Corporation shall have notice of such claim or interests.
If a transfer of shares is made for collateral security, and not absolutely,
this fact shall be so expressed in the entry of the transfer if, when the
certificates are presented to the Corporation for transfer or
uncertificated shares are requested to be transferred, both the transferor
and transferee request the Corporation to do so.

Section 5.06. _Transfer Agent and Registrar_. The Board may appoint one or
more transfer agents and one or more registrars, and may require all
certificates representing shares to bear the signature of any such transfer
agents or registrars.

 

ARTICLE VI

INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 6.01. _Indemnification_.

 

(a) _In General_. The Corporation shall indemnify, to the full extent
permitted by the DGCL and other applicable law, any person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (each, a " _proceeding_ ") by reason of the fact that ( _x_
) such person is or was serving or has agreed to serve as a director or
officer of the Corporation, or ( _y_ ) such person, while serving as a
director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving or has agreed to
serve at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee,
manager or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise or ( _z_ ) such person is or was serving or has agreed to
serve at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer or manager of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or
by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted by such person
in such capacity, and who satisfies the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in the DGCL or other applicable law:

(i) in a proceeding other than a proceeding by or in the right of the
Corporation, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person
or on such persons behalf in connection with such proceeding and any appeal
therefrom, or

(ii) in a proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor, against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually
and reasonably incurred by such person or on such persons behalf in
connection with the defense or settlement of such proceeding and any appeal
therefrom.

 

(b) _Indemnification in Respect of Successful Defense_. To the extent that a
present or former director or officer of the Corporation has been successful
on the merits or otherwise in defense of any proceeding referred to in Section
6.01(a) or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall
be indemnified by the Corporation against expenses (including attorneys
fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.

 



19 (c) _Indemnification in Respect of Proceedings Instituted by Indemnitee_.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Section 6.01(a) does not
require the Corporation to indemnify a present or former director or officer
of the Corporation in respect of a proceeding (or part thereof) instituted by
such person on his or her own behalf, unless such proceeding (or part
thereof) has been authorized by the Board or the indemnification requested is
pursuant to the last sentence of Section 6.03 of these By-laws.

 

Section 6.02. _Advance of Expenses_. The Corporation shall to the fullest
extent permitted by law advance all expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) incurred by a present or former director or officer in defending any
proceeding prior to the final disposition of such proceeding upon written
request of such person and delivery of an undertaking by such person to repay
such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation under this Article VI or
otherwise. The Corporation may authorize any counsel for the Corporation to
represent (subject to applicable conflict of interest considerations) such
present or former director or officer in any proceeding, whether or not the
Corporation is a party to such proceeding.

 

Section 6.03. _Procedure for Indemnification_. Any indemnification under
Section 6.01 of these By-laws or any advance of expenses under Section 6.02
of these By-laws shall be made only against a written request therefor
(together with supporting documentation) submitted by or on behalf of the
person seeking indemnification or advance. Indemnification may be sought by a
person under Section 6.01 of these By-laws in respect of a proceeding only to
the extent that both the expenses and liabilities for which indemnification is
sought and all portions of the proceeding relevant to the determination of
whether the person has satisfied any appropriate standard of conduct have
become final. A person seeking indemnification or advance of expenses may seek
to enforce such persons rights to indemnification or advance of expenses (as
the case may be) in the Delaware Court of Chancery to the extent all or any
portion of a requested indemnification has not been granted within 90 days of,
or to the extent all or any portion of a requested advance of expenses has not
been granted within 20 days of, the submission of such request. All expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by such person in connection
with successfully establishing such persons right to indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this Article, in whole or in part, shall also
be indemnified by the Corporation.

Section 6.04. _Burden of Proof_.

 

(a) In any proceeding brought to enforce the right of a person to receive
indemnification to which such person is entitled under Section 6.01 of these
By-laws, the Corporation has the burden of demonstrating that the standard of
conduct applicable under the DGCL or other applicable law was not met. A prior
determination by the Corporation (including its Board or any Committee
thereof, its independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the
claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct does not itself
constitute evidence that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of
conduct.

 

(b) In any proceeding brought to enforce a claim for advances to which a
person is entitled under Section 6.02 of these By-laws, the person seeking an
advance need only show that he or she has satisfied the requirements expressly
set forth in Section 6.02 of these By-laws.

 



20 Section 6.05. _Contract Right; Non-Exclusivity; Survival_.

 

(a) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this
Article VI shall be deemed to be separate contract rights between the
Corporation and each director and officer who serves in any such capacity at
any time while these provisions as well as the relevant provisions of the DGCL
are in effect, and no repeal or modification of any of these provisions or
any relevant provisions of the DGCL shall adversely affect any right or
obligation of such director or officer existing at the time of such repeal or
modification with respect to any state of facts then or previously existing or
any proceeding previously or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole
or in part upon any such state of facts. Such "contract rights" may not be
modified retroactively as to any present or former director or officer without
the consent of such director or officer.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this
Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other indemnification or
advancement of expenses to which a present or former director or officer of
the Corporation seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be
entitled by any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors,
or otherwise.

(c) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this
Article VI to any present or former director or officer of the Corporation
shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such
person.

 

Section 6.06. _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance
on behalf of any person who is or was or has agreed to become a director or
officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director or officer of another Corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted
against such person and incurred by such person or on such persons behalf in
any such capacity, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or
not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
liability under the provisions of this Article.

Section 6.07. _Employees and Agents_. The Board, or any officer authorized by
the Board generally or in the specific case to make indemnification
decisions, may cause the Corporation to indemnify any present or former
employee or agent of the Corporation in such manner and for such liabilities
as the Board may determine, up to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL
and other applicable law.

Section 6.08. _Interpretation; Severability_. Terms defined in Sections
145(h) or (i) of the DGCL have the meanings set forth in such sections when
used in this Article VI. If this Article or any portion hereof shall be
invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director or officer of the
Corporation as to costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys fees),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in

 



21  settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, including an action by or in the
right of the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable
portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated and to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

 

ARTICLE VII

Section 7.01. _Registered Office_. The registered office of the Corporation in
the State of Delaware shall be located at the location provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation.

of business at such other locations within or without the State of Delaware

26 Exhibit D  Form of New Amethyst Corporate Governance Guidelines

 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES OF

 

ENVISION HEALTHCARE CORPORATION

 

Adopted [●], [2016]

The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Envision Healthcare Corporation (the
"Corporation"), is elected by the stockholders of the Corporation to oversee
the Corporations management and operations. The Board sets policy for
the Corporation, assists with strategic planning, selects the Chief Executive
Officer and President and monitors the performance of the Chief Executive
Officer and President, and provides management with appropriate advice and
feedback concerning the business and operations of the Corporation.

The Board has adopted these Corporate Governance Guidelines to assist the
Board in the exercise of its responsibilities. These guidelines are in
addition to, and are not intended to change or interpret, any federal or state
law or regulation, including the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the
Corporations Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws. These guidelines may
be modified from time to time by the Board as it deems appropriate.

1\. Director Qualifications and Selection of Board Members

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing
with the Board annually the requisite skills and characteristics of the new
Board members as well as the Board as a whole. This assessment will take into
consideration any requirements of independence, as well as the skills and
experience of candidates and the needs of the Board.

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will recommend to the Board
appropriate criteria for the selection of new directors and periodically
review the criteria adopted by the Board and, if deemed desirable, recommend
to the Board changes to such criteria. The Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee will identify and select, or recommend that the Board select, Board
candidates whom the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes are
qualified and suitable to become members of the Board consistent with the
criteria for selection of new directors adopted from time to time by the
Board. 

Director candidates should demonstrate strong values and discipline, high
ethical standards, a commitment to full participation on the Board and its
committees, and relevant career experience, along with other skills and
characteristics that meet the current needs of the Board. The Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee will consider whether candidates meet
applicable independence standards where appropriate and evaluate any
potential conflicts of interest with respect to each candidate.

Until [insert one year anniversary of the Closing Date], if a vacancy occurs
for any reason in a Board seat previously occupied by an AmSurg Designee (as
defined in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 15, 2016, by and
among Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc., AmSurg Corp. and New Amethyst
Corp., as amended from time to time (the "Merger Agreement")), the vacancy
will be filled by a person nominated by the remaining  AmSurg Designees and such person will thereafter be deemed an AmSurg
Designee for all purposes under these Corporate Governance Guidelines and (ii)
if a vacancy occurs for any reason in a Board seat previously occupied by a
Holdings Designee (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the vacancy will be
filled by a person nominated by the remaining Holdings Designees and such
person will thereafter be deemed to be a Holdings Designee for all purposes
under these Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee will be responsible for assessing the qualifications of
any person nominated pursuant to this paragraph to ensure that such person
satisfies the director qualification criteria set forth in these Corporate
Governance Guidelines, and determining whether such person should be
recommended for appointment as a director by the Board of Directors. The Board
of Directors shall take all necessary action to appoint as a director of the
Company a person nominated by the AmSurg Designees or the Holdings Designees,
as applicable, and recommended by the Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee as set forth in this paragraph.

 

2\. Director Independence

The Board will have a majority of "independent" directors who will satisfy
the independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange relating to
directors. The Board will review and determine the independence of each
director annually.

 

3\. Board Size

The Board presently has 14 members. The number of Directors shall not be less
than one. In conducting its annual assessment of the composition of the Board,
the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall make recommendations
for changes in the size of the Board as appropriate, taking into account the
goal of having a Board size appropriate to provide diversity of thought and
experience, as well as individual accountability.

 

4\. Additional Board Service

No director will serve on more than three other public company boards (for
the avoidance of doubt, a public company is a company with publicly traded
equity) without the prior consent of the Board, and directors who are a chief
executive officer, chief financial officer or other senior executive of a
public company who is designated as an "executive officer" of the public
company for the purposes of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, may serve on no more than two other public company boards without
the prior consent of the Board. Directors will advise the Chairman of the
Board and the Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee in advance of
accepting an invitation to serve on another public company board.

Service on boards and committees of other organizations should be consistent
with the Corporations Conflict of Interest Policy and the Corporations Code
of Business Conduct and Ethics. If a member of the Corporations Audit
Committee serves on more than three public company audit committees, the Board
will determine whether such simultaneous service impairs the directors
ability to serve effectively on the Corporations Audit Committee.

 



2 5\. Office of Chairman

 

The Chairman will be elected by the Board from among its members to preside at
all meetings of the Board. It is the policy of the Board that it may choose
in its discretion whether to separate or combine the offices of Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer and President on a case-by-case basis.

 

The Chairman will lead the agenda-setting process for Board meetings. As set
forth in the By-laws of the Corporation, as amended from time to time (the
"By-laws"), the Chairman or the Chief Executive Officer and President or, in
the absence or disability of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer and
President, the Secretary, or one-third of the directors then in office
may call special meetings of the Board.

The Executive Chairman of the Board (the "Executive Chairman") will be
designated as the Chairman until [insert one year anniversary of the Closing
Date] or such other time as the Board may determine in accordance with Section
11.03(b) of Article XI of the By-laws.

 

6\. Presiding Director Responsibilities

 

If the Board chooses to combine the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer and President, a Presiding Director will be appointed annually by the
independent directors, who will review all relevant facts and circumstances to
ensure the Presiding Director, if and when appointed, is in fact independent.
Although elected annually, the Presiding Director, if and when appointed, is
generally expected to serve more than one year.

If and when a Presiding Director is appointed, the role of the Presiding
Director would be as follows:



     |  |  | Coordinate the activities of non-management and
independent directors; 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | Preside and act as chairman of board meetings when the
Chairman of the Board is not in attendance, including executive sessions of
the independent directors; 
---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  | Provide the Chairman with input as appropriate on agendas
for the Board and committee meetings; 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | Coordinate and develop the agenda for, and chair
executive sessions of, the non-management and independent directors; 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | Serve as liaison between the Chairman and the other
members of the Board, including communicating other members requests to call
special meetings of the Board; 
---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  | Call additional meetings of independent directors as
he/she deems appropriate; and 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | Make himself or herself available for consultation and
direct communication with major stockholders, if requested. 
---|---|---|--- 
 

In performing the duties described above, the Presiding Director, if and when
appointed, will consult with the Chairs of the appropriate Board committees
and solicit their participation in order to avoid diluting the authority or
responsibilities of such committee Chairs.

 



3 7\. Roles and Responsibilities: Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
and President

 

The roles and responsibilities of the Executive Chairman are set forth on
Exhibit A to these Corporate Governance Guidelines. The office of Executive
Chairman shall cease to exist and Exhibit A to these Corporate Governance
Guidelines shall be of no further force or effect on [insert one year
anniversary of the Closing Date] or such other time as the Board
may determine in accordance with Section 11.03(b) of Article XI of the By-
laws.

8\. Term Limits and Director Retirement

 

There are no established term limits for service on the Board.

 

9\. Director Responsibilities

Each director will act in the best interests of the Corporation and its
stockholders. Directors will preserve the confidentiality of confidential
material given or presented to the Board. Directors must disclose to other
directors any potential conflicts of interest they may have with respect to
any matter under discussion and, if appropriate, refrain from voting on a
matter in which they may have a conflict.

 

Each director, will, in the performance of such directors duties, be fully
protected in relying in good faith upon the records of the Corporation and
upon such information, opinions, reports or statements presented to the
Corporation by any of the Corporations officers or employees, or committees
of the Board, or by any other person as to matters such director
reasonably believes are within such other persons professional or expert
competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of
the Corporation.

 

10\. Changes in Principal Business Responsibilities

 

Directors are expected to report changes in their principal business
responsibilities, including retirement, to the Chairman and the Chair of the
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Together with such report, the
reporting director will also tender his or her resignation to the Chairman and
the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee will review whether the new occupation, or
retirement, of the director is consistent with the specific rationale for
originally selecting that individual and the guidelines for board membership.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will recommend action to be
taken by the full Board regarding the resignation based on the circumstances
of retirement, if that is the case, or in the case of a new position, the
responsibility and type of position and industry involved. The bias of the
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will be to accept the
resignation if the basis for originally selecting the individual no longer
exists. The director who has experienced the change in circumstance shall not
participate in the deliberations by the Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee and the Board with respect to the resignation.

 



4 11\. Resignation of Chief Executive Officer and President

 

If the Corporations Chief Executive Officer and President leaves that office,
that person will tender to the Chairman and the Chair of the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee his or her resignation from the Board. Upon
receipt of that resignation, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
will recommend action to be taken by the full Board based on
the circumstances of the former Chief Executive Officer and Presidents
departure from that office, taking into consideration the advisability of
retaining the former Chief Executive Officer and President as a director for a
period of time to facilitation the transition of leadership to his or her
successor, as well as the ability of the former Chief Executive Officer and
President to continue to contribute to the effective oversight of the
Corporation as a director. The former Chief Executive Officer and President
shall not participate in the deliberations of the Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee and the Board with respect to the resignation.

 

12\. Board Meetings

Regular meetings of the Board shall be held on such dates, and at such times
and places as are determined from time to time by resolution of the Board.

may also take action from time to time by unanimous written consent in
accordance with the By-laws. Directors are expected to attend all or
substantially all Board meetings and meetings of committees on which they
serve each year, and to spend the time needed and meet as frequently
as necessary to properly discharge their responsibilities.

13\. Board Materials

 

To the extent practicable, appropriate materials and data will be distributed
to the directors before Board meetings and committee meetings so as to allow
adequate time for consideration of key issues and general preparation for the
meeting. Directors should review any such materials in advance of the meeting.

 

14\. Agenda

The Chairman will establish the agenda for each Board meeting and, to the
extent practicable, distribute it in advance of each meeting. Board members
may request that additional items be included on the agenda, and may raise
items for discussion and consideration that are not on the agenda for that
meeting.

15\. Executive Sessions

 

The non-management directors will meet in executive session without management
present at each regularly scheduled Board meeting. The directors may also
meet in executive session with one or more members of management present. The
Executive Chairman will preside over executive sessions of the Board in which
he is a participant. The directors will select a director to preside over
each executive session in which the Executive Chairman does not participate.
If at any time there are non-management directors who are not independent
directors, an executive session including only independent directors will be
held at least once a year.

 



5 16\. Board Committees

Committee, Compliance Committee, and Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee. Committee members will be appointed by the Board upon
recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.

purposes and responsibilities of the committees, qualifications for committee
membership, procedures for appointing committee members, procedures for annual
evaluation of the committee performance and such other matters as the Board
