integral part of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and that, without these

compensate Parent and Merger Sub for the costs, expenses, efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on
the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees on behalf of itself and its
affiliates that in the event that the Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by the Company
pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;7.3</U>, the right to receive the Termination Fee shall constitute
each of Parent&#146;s and Merger Sub&#146;s and each of their affiliates&#146; and Representatives&#146; sole and
exclusive remedy under this Agreement; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that with respect to any
termination pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;7.1(c)(ii)(C)</U>, in addition to the Termination Fee, the
Company will not be relieved of any liability for damages to the extent set forth in
<U>Section&nbsp;7.2</U>.
