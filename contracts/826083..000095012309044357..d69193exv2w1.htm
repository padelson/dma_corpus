ARTICLE 1 

   

THE TENDER OFFER  

  

 Section 1.1 _The Offer_. 

  

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE 7_ and that none of the events set forth in _clauses (c)_ or _(d)_ of the first paragraph of _Annex B_ hereto shall have occurred and be continuing, within ten business days (as such term is defined in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act, " _Business Days_ ") after the date hereof, Merger Sub shall (and the Company shall cooperate with Merger Sub to) commence 

    ##### 

  

 

(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) an offer
to purchase all outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company at the
purchase price of $30.00 per share of Common Stock (such price, or any higher
price per share of Common Stock paid by Merger Sub pursuant to the terms of
the Offer, the " _Per Share Amount_ ") and shall, upon commencement of
the Offer but after affording the Company and its counsel reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon and giving reasonable and good
faith consideration to any comments made thereby, file a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto, including the exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") and all other
necessary documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_
") and make all deliveries, mailings and telephonic notices required by Rule
14d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, in each case in connection with the
Offer (the " _Offer Documents_ "), and shall consummate the Offer, subject to
the terms and conditions hereof and thereof. The Offer Documents will comply
in all material respects with the provisions of all applicable Federal
securities Laws. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in  _Annex B_ hereto
(the " _Tender Offer Conditions_ "), Merger Sub shall, upon the expiration of
the Offer, accept for payment, and pay for (after giving effect to any
required withholding or stock transfer Tax), all shares of Common Stock
validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn on the Acceptance
Date. The obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment and to pay for any
shares of Common Stock validly tendered shall be subject solely to
the satisfaction or waiver by Merger Sub of the Tender Offer Conditions. The
Per Share Amount shall be net to the seller in cash, without interest,
subject to reduction for any applicable withholding or stock transfer Taxes
payable by such seller. No shares of Common Stock held by the Company or
its Subsidiaries shall be tendered pursuant to the Offer. 

   

 (b) Parent on behalf of Merger Sub expressly reserves the right from time to time, subject to  _Section 1.1(c)_ and _Section 1.1(d)_, in its sole discretion, to waive any Tender Offer Condition, to increase the Per Share Amount or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , that without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) decrease the Per Share Amount or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (ii) decrease the number of shares of Common Stock sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iii) amend or waive satisfaction of the Minimum Condition (as defined in _Annex B_ ), (iv) impose additional conditions to the Offer, (v) make any change in the Offer that would require an extension or delay of the then current Expiration Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _clause (v)_ shall not limit the right of Parent and Merger Sub to extend the Expiration Date as required or permitted by _Section 1.1(d)_, (vi) modify or amend the Tender Offer Conditions (other than to waive such Tender Offer Conditions, except for the Minimum Condition) or (vii) modify or amend any other term of the Offer, in the case of _clauses (vi)_ and  _(vii)_ , in any manner materially adverse to the holders of shares of Common Stock in their capacities as holders of shares of Common Stock. 

   

 (c) No agreement or representation hereby is made or shall be made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to information supplied by the Company expressly for inclusion in, or with respect to Company information derived from the Company SEC Filings that is included or incorporated by reference in, the Offer Documents. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect. Merger Sub shall cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and 

    ##### 

  

 

the Offer Documents, as so corrected or supplemented, to be promptly
disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable Federal securities Laws. The Company and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any Offer
Documents (including each amendment or supplement thereto) before they are
filed with the SEC. Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel. Merger Sub
shall provide the Company with (in writing, if written), and shall consult
with the Company regarding, any comments (written or oral) that may be
received by Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt thereof. The
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any
proposed responses before they are filed with the SEC. 

   

 (d) The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the 20th Business Day following the commencement of the Offer (determined using Rules 14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) (such date, or such subsequent date to which the expiration of the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Merger Sub shall not terminate or withdraw the Offer other than in connection with the effective termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1_ hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE 7_ , Merger Sub, without Parent or Merger Sub obtaining the consent of the Company, (i) shall extend the Expiration Date for any period required by the rules and regulations of the SEC or the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") applicable to the Offer, including in connection with an increase in the Per Share Amount, (ii) shall extend the Expiration Date if, on any then scheduled Expiration Date, any of the Tender Offer Conditions is not satisfied or waived by Parent, for such periods for up to five Business Days at a time (or such other period as shall be approved by the Company) as Merger Sub may deem reasonably necessary, but, except as provided in _Section 1.1(d)(iii)_ or as required by the rules and regulations of the SEC or the NYSE applicable to the Offer (including in connection with an increase in the Per Share Amount), in no event may the Expiration Date be extended pursuant to this _clause (ii)_ to a date later than the Outside Date, and (iii) may extend the Expiration Date beyond the Outside Date for up to a period not to exceed the period which ends on the 15th Business Day after the date that either (w) the Company shall have publicly announced the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal in the event such announcement is made less than 10 Business Days prior to the Outside Date, (x) the Company publicly announces its reaffirmation of its approval or recommendation of the Offer following the public announcement of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal in the event that such reaffirmation or announcement is made less than 10 Business Days prior to the Outside Date, (y) an Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred prior to the Outside Date or (z) the Company advises Parent of an Acquisition Proposal in accordance with _Section 5.3(d)_ if such advisement is received by Parent less than 10 Business Days prior to the Outside Date. Except as expressly provided in this  _Section 1.1(d)_, Parent shall not extend the Offer if all of the Tender Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived and it is permitted under applicable Law to accept for payment and pay for validly tendered shares of Common Stock that are not validly withdrawn. Nothing in this  _Section 1.1(d)_ shall affect any termination rights in _ARTICLE 7_. 

   

 (e) In the event the Acceptance Date occurs but Merger Sub does not acquire a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to enable a Short-Form Merger to occur 

    ##### 

  

 

pursuant to _Section 2.7_ hereof, Merger Sub may (in its sole discretion)
provide a "subsequent offering period" for a number of days to be determined
by Parent but not less than three nor more than 20 Business Days in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

   

 (f) Promptly upon the satisfaction or waiver by Merger Sub of the Tender Offer Conditions in accordance with _Section 1.1(b)_, Merger Sub shall (i) as soon as practicable after the Expiration Date, accept for payment and pay for all shares of Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the date of acceptance for payment, the " _Acceptance Date_ "), which acceptance may be by oral notice to the Paying Agent, (ii) on the Acceptance Date, deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Per Share Amount for all such accepted shares of Common Stock and (iii) as soon as practicable following such deposit, cause the Paying Agent to pay for all shares of Common Stock so accepted for payment. Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. 

   

 (g) Promptly after the Acceptance Date, the Company shall take all action requested by Parent necessary to elect to be treated as a "controlled company" as defined by New York Stock Exchange Rule 303A.00 and make any necessary filings and disclosures associated with such status. 

   

 Section 1.2 _Company Action_. 

  

 (a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and represents that the Board of Directors, at a duly called and held meeting, has unanimously (by all directors present) adopted resolutions: (i) determining that the terms of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declaring the Agreement advisable; (ii) approving the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Tender Agreements, the Offer and the Merger; (iii) recommending that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their shares of Common Stock to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer and, if applicable, approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger (the actions in _clause (iii)_ , " _Recommendation_ "); (iv) rendering the restrictions on business combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL inapplicable to the Tender Agreements, the Offer, this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger; (v) resolving to make the Recommendation to the stockholders of the Company and directing, that, to the extent required by the DGCL, this Agreement be submitted for adoption by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Meeting and (vi) electing that the Offer and the Merger, to the extent of the Board of Directors power and authority and to the extent permitted by Law, not be subject to any "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination," "fair price" or other form of anti-takeover Laws (collectively, " _Takeover Laws_ ") of any jurisdiction that may purport to be applicable to this Agreement (such actions by the Board of Directors described in the preceding  _clauses (i)_ through _(vi)_ , collectively, the " _Board Actions_ "). The Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the Recommendation in the Offer Documents.

 Section 1.3 _Top-Up Option_. 

  

 (a) _Grant of Top-Up Option_. The Company hereby grants to Parent and Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase, at a price per share equal to the Per Share Amount (the " _Per Common Share Price_ "), up to that number of newly issued shares of Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") that, when added to the number of shares of Common Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option (excluding shares of Common Stock tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures as to which delivery has not been completed as of the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option), constitutes one share of Common Stock more than 90% of the sum of (x) the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares and (y) the total number of shares of Common Stock that are issuable within ten Business Days after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares upon the vesting, conversion or exercise of all outstanding options, warrants, convertible or exchangeable securities and similar rights, regardless of the conversion or exercise price or other terms and conditions thereof. The Top-Up Option may be exercised at any time on or after any Expiration Date and on or prior to the fifth Business Day after the later to occur of the Expiration Date or the expiration date of any "subsequent offering period" under _Section 1.1(e)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions that (i) no provision of any applicable Law (other than pursuant to the rules and regulations of the NYSE) shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise, (ii) the issuance of Top-Up Option Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option would not require approval by the Companys stockholders under applicable Law (other than pursuant to the rules and regulations of the NYSE), (iii) immediately after the exercise of the Top-Up Option and issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, the number of shares of Common Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub (excluding shares of Common Stock tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures as to which delivery has not been completed as of the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option) constitutes one share of Common Stock more than 90% of the total outstanding shares of Common Stock, (iv) the number of Top-Up Option Shares issued pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall in no event exceed the number of authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock not otherwise reserved for issuance for outstanding Company Stock Options or other obligations of the Company and (v) Merger Sub has accepted for payment and deposited or caused to be deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 1.1(f)(ii)_ cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Per Share Amount for all accepted shares of Common Stock. The Parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished consistent with all applicable Laws (other than pursuant to the rules and regulations of the NYSE), including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Option Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "). 

   

 (b) _Exercise of Top-Up Option_. Upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option in accordance with _Section 1.3(a)_, Merger Sub shall so notify the Company and shall set forth in such notice (i) the number of shares of Common Stock expected to be owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares and (ii) a place and time selected by Merger Sub for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares with the time for the closing being not more than five Business Days after the exercise of the Top-Up Option. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt 

   ##### 

 

   

of such notice, notify Merger Sub of the sum of (1) the number of shares of
Common Stock then outstanding and (2) the total number of shares of Common
Stock that are issuable within ten Business Days after the scheduled closing
of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares upon the vesting, conversion or
exercise of all outstanding options, warrants, convertible or
exchangeable securities and similar rights, regardless of the conversion or
exercise price or other terms and conditions thereof. At the closing of the
purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, Merger Sub shall pay the Company the
aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant to
this  _Section 1.3_, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub
a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares. The aggregate purchase
price payable for the Top-Up Shares may be paid either (i) entirely in cash
or (ii) at the election of Merger Sub or Parent, by paying in cash an amount
equal to not less than the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option Shares and
by Merger Sub executing and delivering to the Company an unsecured promissory
note having a principal amount equal to the balance of the aggregate purchase
price for the Top-Up Option Shares. Any such promissory note shall bear
interest at the rate of interest that would be payable by Parent under its
commercial paper program for a similar term of borrowing as of the date of the
promissory note, shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of
execution and delivery of such promissory note and may be prepaid at any time
and from time to time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty.

   

 (c) _Adjustment upon Changes in Capitalization_. In the event of any change in the number of shares of outstanding Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares, merger, consolidation, reorganization or the like or any other change in the corporate or capital structure of the Company that would have the effect of diluting Merger Subs rights under the Top-Up Option, the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the Per Common Share Price shall be adjusted appropriately so as to restore Merger Sub to its rights hereunder with respect to the Top-Up Option; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 1.3_ shall be construed as permitting the Company to take any action or enter into any transaction otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

   

 (d) _Acknowledgement_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, and will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

   

 Section 1.4 _Directors_.

  

 (a) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, promptly upon the deposit with the Paying Agent by Merger Sub in accordance with _Section 1.1(f)_ of cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Per Share Amount for all shares of Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer which represent at least 66 2/3% of the total outstanding shares of Common Stock, and from time to time thereafter, Parent shall be

   ##### 

  

   

entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole
number, on the Board of Directors equal to the product of (i) the total
number of directors on the Board of Directors (giving effect to the directors
designated by Parent and elected or appointed to the Board pursuant to this
sentence and including directors continuing to serve as directors of
the Company) multiplied by (ii) the percentage (the " _Board Percentage_ ")
that the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates (including, for purposes of
such percentage, the shares of Common Stock that are accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer and that the Per Share Amount has been deposited
for) bears to the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding;
_provided_ , that following the time directors designated by Parent are
elected or appointed to the Board of Directors, and prior to the Effective
Time, the Board of Directors shall always have at least three directors who
are directors of the Company on the date hereof and who are neither officers
of the Company nor designees, affiliates or associates (within the meaning of
the Federal securities Laws) of Parent (each, an " _Independent Director_ ");
_provided_ , _further_ , that if there are in office fewer than three
Independent Directors, the Company shall take all actions necessary to cause
a person or, if there are two vacancies, two persons designated by the
remaining Independent Director(s) to fill such vacancy(ies) who shall be
neither an officer of the Company nor a designee, affiliate or associate of
Parent, and each such person(s) shall be deemed to be an Independent Director
for purposes of this Agreement, or, if no Independent Directors remain,
the other directors shall designate three persons to fill the vacancies who
shall be neither an officer of the Company nor a designee, affiliate or
associate of Parent, and each such person shall be deemed to be an
Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement. At each such time,
the Company shall, subject to any limitations imposed by applicable Law or
NYSE rules, also cause (x) each committee of the Board of Directors, (y) if
requested by Parent, the board of directors of each of the Companys
Subsidiaries and (z) if requested by Parent, each committee of such board
of directors of each of the Companys Subsidiaries to include persons
designated by Parent constituting the Board Percentage of each such committee
or board as Parents designees constitute on the Board of Directors. The
Company shall, upon request by Parent, secure the resignations of such number
of directors as necessary to enable Parents designees to be elected or
appointed to the Board of Directors in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 1.4(a)_ and shall cause Parents designees to be so elected or
appointed. The Company shall promptly amend, or cause to be amended, the
Bylaws, if necessary, to comply with the obligations of the Company pursuant
to this  _Section 1.4_. The Company shall promptly take, at the Companys
expense, any lawful action necessary to effect any such election, including
mailing to its stockholders the information required by Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder ( _provided_ , that Parent
has provided the information described in the following sentence), unless
such information has previously been provided to the Companys stockholders in
the Schedule 14D-9. Parent shall supply to the Company in writing and be
solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and its
nominees, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following the time directors designated by Parent are elected or appointed to the Board of Directors and prior to the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of a majority of the Independent Directors shall be required to (i) authorize any Contract between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub and any of their affiliates (other than the Company and any of its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, (ii) amend or terminate this Agreement on behalf of the 

   ##### 

  

   

Company, (iii) use or waive any of the Companys rights or remedies hereunder,
(iv) extend the time for performance of Parents or Merger Subs obligations
hereunder or (v) take any other action by the Company in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby required to be taken by the
Board of Directors. The Independent Directors shall have the authority
to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company) and
other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined appropriate by the
Independent Directors and shall have the authority to institute any action on
behalf of the Company to enforce the performance of this Agreement.

   ##### 

  

   

certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
shares of Common Stock shall thereafter only represent the right to receive
the Merger Consideration therefor. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares of Common Stock (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.8(a)_, but rather the holders of such Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262 (and at the Effective Time such Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holders shall cease to have any right with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration as provided in  _Section 2.8(a)_.

 (d) Each share of the Merger Subs common stock, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of the Surviving Corporations common stock, par value $0.01 per share. 

   

 (e) The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect any change in the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares, merger, consolidation, reorganization or the like or any other change in the corporate or capital structure;  _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.8(e)_ shall be construed as permitting the Company to take any action or enter into any transaction otherwise prohibited by this Agreement. 

   

 Section 2.9 _Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub will designate a bank, trust company or transfer agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the 

    ##### 

  

    

" _Paying Agent_ ") to facilitate the receipt by the Companys stockholders of
the Per Share Amount in connection with the Offer and the Merger
Consideration in connection with the Merger. 

   

 (b) At or before the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Merger Consideration to be delivered (other than any portion thereof allocable to any Appraisal Shares, which shall be withheld by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to satisfy related appraisal or dissenters rights matters and the costs thereof) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the Paying Agent (the " _Payment Account_ "). The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_ out of the Payment Account. The Payment Account shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to Parent or an affiliate of Parent as Parent directs; _provided_ , _however_ , that any net loss resulting from such investments shall be promptly reimbursed by Parent to the Payment Account upon demand by the Paying Agent. The Payment Account shall not be used for any purpose other than as set forth in this _Section 2.9(b)_. 

   

 (c) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_ and cause to be furnished promptly to any record holder upon request thereby after the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal, which shall (i) specify that delivery of the Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and (ii) provide instructions for the holders of the Certificates to use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions contained therein, and along with such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, including those documents set forth in  _Section 2.8(a)_ (or, if such shares of Common Stock are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such shares on a book-entry account statement (it being understood that any references herein to "Certificates" shall be deemed to include references to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Common Stock)), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the shares of Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until 

   ##### 

  

   

surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.9(c)_, each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (d) Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law or under any other applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. As used in this Agreement, " _Code_ " means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 

   

 Section 2.10 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. All amounts paid upon the surrender or exchange of shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be forwarded to the Paying Agent where they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in  _Section 2.9_. 

  

 Section 2.11 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such amounts as may be required pursuant to _Section 2.9_ with respect to the number of shares of Common Stock represented by such Certificate; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

 Section 2.12 _Termination of Payment Account, Escheat, etc._ Any portion of the Payment Account which remains undistributed to the holders of Common Stock for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of certificates formerly representing shares of Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with the exchange procedures set forth above shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, as general creditors thereof) for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. None of Parent, the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar Law. 

  

 Section 2.13 _Company Equity Plans_. 

  

 (a) Except as set forth in _Section 2.13(c)_ and except for any option to purchase Common Stock pursuant to the ESPPs (defined below), each option to purchase Common Stock or stock appreciation right settleable in Common Stock (collectively, the 

    ##### 

  

    

" _Company Stock Option Awards_ ") granted under any equity based compensation
plan of the Company (the " _Company Stock Plans_ ") that is outstanding under
a Company Stock Plan immediately prior to the time that the Company becomes a
member of the same "affiliated group," within the meaning of Section 1504 of
the Code, of Parent (such time the " _80% Threshold Time_ "), will vest and
be cancelled subject to and immediately following the 80% Threshold Time, and
the holder of such Company Stock Option Awards will, in full settlement of
such Company Stock Option Awards, receive from or on behalf of Merger Sub an
amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) in cash equal to the
product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price or base price, as applicable, per share of such Company
Stock Option Award, multiplied by (y) the total number of shares of Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option Award (the aggregate amount of
such cash hereinafter referred to as the " _Option Award Consideration_ ").
Merger Sub shall pay or cause to be paid to holders of the Company
Stock Option Awards the Option Award Consideration as soon as
administratively practicable following the 80% Threshold Time. 

   

 (b) Except as set forth in _Section 2.13(c)_, each restricted stock unit (including any restricted stock award, phantom restricted stock award, deferred stock unit, whether performance-based, time-based or otherwise) (the " _Company Restricted Stock Units_ ") that is outstanding under any Company Stock Plan immediately prior to the 80% Threshold Time, will become vested or earned and be cancelled subject to and immediately following the 80% Threshold Time and converted into the right to receive an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) in cash equal to the product of (x) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (y) the total number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit (the aggregate amount of such cash hereinafter referred to as the " _Restricted Stock Unit Consideration_ "). Merger Sub shall pay or cause to be paid to holders of the Company Restricted Stock Units the Restricted Stock Unit Consideration as soon as practicable following the 80% Threshold Time; _provided_ , _however_ , outstanding stock award deferrals under the Amended and Restated Perot Systems Corporation 2006 Non-Employee Director Equity Compensation Plan shall be paid at the time(s) specified by the terms of such plan. 

   

 (c) Except as set forth in _Section 2.13_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, to the extent a holder of a Company Stock Option Award or a Restricted Stock Unit is listed in _Section 2.13(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (a " _Rollover Eligible Employee_ "), and enters into a Rollover Restricted Stock Unit Election Form, the form of which is attached as Appendix A to  _Section 2.13_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Equity Conversion Agreement_ "), on or before September 30, 2009 to convert a percentage of his Option Award Consideration or Restricted Stock Unit Consideration into restricted stock unit awards of Parent, rather than receiving the amounts described in _Sections 2.13(a)_ or _2.13(b)_ , as applicable, the percentage of such Rollover Eligible Employees Option Award Consideration and Restricted Stock Unit Consideration elected to be converted in the Equity Conversion Agreement (together, " _Rollover Amount_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive a time-based vesting restricted stock unit award agreement settleable in the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Parent (" _Parent Stock_ " and such award, the " _Parent Restricted Stock Unit_ "). The Parent Restricted Stock Unit shall have material terms and conditions substantially the same as those contained in the form of the agreement attached as Appendix B to _Section 2.13(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. The number of Parent Restricted Stock Units to which a Rollover Eligible Employee will be entitled shall be determined by multiplying the Rollover Amount by two and dividing such 

   ##### 

  

   

amount by the Fair Market Value of a share of Parent Stock. For purposes of
this _Section 2.13(c)_ , "Fair Market Value" shall mean the closing trading
price of a share of Parent Stock as reported on Nasdaq Global Select Market
on the Closing Date. Any Option Award Consideration or Restricted Stock Unit
Consideration payable to the Rollover Eligible Employee after the
application of the Equity Conversion Agreement shall be payable pursuant to
_Sections 2.13(a)_ and  _2.13(b)_. 

   

 (d) The Company shall take such action as may be necessary to (i) establish the end of the purchase period in effect as of the date hereof under the Companys 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plans (" _ESPPs_ ") no later than the last day of the offering period ending immediately after the commencement of the Offer with respect to any offering otherwise then in effect (the " _ESPP Exercise Date_ "), (ii) suspend any subsequent purchase periods that would otherwise arise after the close of the purchase period currently in effect and prior to the Effective Time and (iii) terminate the ESPPs as of the Effective Time or such earlier date as determined by the Company to be administratively reasonable. Each ESPP participants accumulated payroll contributions as of the ESPP Exercise Date that are not withdrawn as of such date shall be applied toward the purchase of shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPPs. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the ESPP Exercise Date, following the application of accumulated payroll contributions toward the purchase of shares of Common Stock in accordance with the preceding sentence, Parent shall cause or permit the Company or the Merger Sub, as applicable, to return to participants any of their respective accumulated payroll contributions not applied to the purchase of shares of Common Stock under the ESPPs, if any. 

   

 (e) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the obligations and succeed to the rights of the Company under the Company Stock Plans with respect to the Company Stock Option Awards and the Company Restricted Stock Units (the " _Company Equity Awards_ "). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall take all action required to reflect the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.13_ to ensure that, following the Effective Time, no Person other than Parent and its Subsidiaries shall have any right (i) to acquire equity securities of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof or (ii) to receive any payment in respect of any equity based compensatory award other than with respect to the payment of the Option Award Consideration and the Restricted Stock Unit Consideration as provided in _Sections 2.13(a)_ and _2.13(b)_. From and after the Effective Time, all references to the Company (other than any references relating to a "change in control" of the Company) in each Company Stock Plan and in each agreement evidencing any award of Company Equity Awards shall be deemed to refer to Parent. Nothing in this _Section 2.13_ is intended to release any employee or service provider to the Company from any provisions relating to any non-competition, non-solicitation, or confidentiality provisions of any Company Equity Award and any associated damages or forfeitures (the " _Equity Award Restrictive Covenants_ "), which shall survive the Effective Time. The Company shall take such action as may be necessary to insure the survival of the Equity Award Restrictive Covenants and the succession of Parent to the benefits of the Equity Award Restrictive Covenants.

   ##### 

  

 

cause the Company to terminate this Agreement and (C) the Board of Directors
shall not make such an Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement if, prior to the expiration of such five Business
Day period (or any additional three Business Day period), Parent makes a
proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement that the Board
of Directors determines in good faith (after consulting with outside legal
counsel and the Company Financial Advisor) to be at least as favorable as the
Superior Proposal; and 

   

 (ii) the Board of Directors may, in response to a material fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances (other than an Acquisition Proposal occurring or arising after the date of this Agreement) that was neither known to the Board of Directors nor reasonably likely as of or prior to the date of this Agreement (and not relating in any way to any Acquisition Proposal) (such material fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances, an " _Intervening Event_ "), fail to make, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Recommendation (which shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change) if the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel), that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board to effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change would violate its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;  _provided_ , that no fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances shall constitute an Intervening Event if such fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances resulted from or arose out of the announcement, pendency or consummation of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and, _provided_ , _further_ , that no Adverse Recommendation Change may be made pursuant to this sentence until after the fifth Business Day following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors intends to take such action and specifying the facts underlying the Board of Directors determination that an Intervening Event has occurred, and the reasons for the Adverse Recommendation Change, in reasonable detail, and then only if during such five Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for an Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of the Intervening Event. 

  

 (d) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall promptly advise Parent, orally and in writing, and in any event no later than 24 hours after receipt, in the event the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or its Subsidiaries Representatives receives any Acquisition Proposal together with the material terms and conditions (including the identity of the Persons making such Acquisition Proposal) of such Acquisition Proposal and a copy of any written documentation delivered to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or its Subsidiaries Representatives in connection therewith.

    ##### 

  

     

 (e) The Company shall promptly inform its Representatives, and shall cause its Subsidiaries promptly to inform their respective Representatives of the obligations under this  _Section 5.3_.

    ##### 

  

    

(including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, and, without limiting the foregoing, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, shall also advance expenses
as incurred to the same such extent; _provided_ , that the person to whom
fees and expenses are advanced shall, if required by applicable Law, provide
an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that
such person is not entitled to indemnification; and (A) fulfill and honor in
all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to
(B) each indemnification agreement in effect between the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Party (each of which agreements is listed

any indemnification provision and any exculpation provision set forth in the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other charter or organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date

 (b) At the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be obtained prepaid (or "tail") directors and officers liability insurance policies for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties at the current coverage level and scope of liability insurance coverage as set forth in the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Such "tail" insurance policies shall provide coverage through the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, so long as the aggregate annual premium is not greater than 300% of the annual premium paid by the Company for its existing directors and officers liability insurance policies during 2009. In the event that such amount is insufficient for such coverage then the Surviving Corporation may spend up to that amount to purchase such lesser coverage as may be obtained with such amount. 

   

 (c) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case, prior to the consummation thereof, Parent provide, or shall cause proper provision to be made so, that the applicable entitys successors or assigns shall assume the obligations set forth in this  _Section 5.9_.

 (e) For purposes of this Agreement, each individual who is entitled to indemnification pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, the DGCL or the indemnification agreements listed in _Section 5.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter at or at any time prior to the Acceptance Date shall be deemed to be an " _Indemnified Party_." 

   

 Section 5.10 _Employee Matters_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall provide the employees of the Company who are employed by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") and their dependents, as applicable, with either, or a combination of, (a) comparable types and levels of employee benefits as those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries and their dependents, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the employee benefit arrangements of Parent (such arrangements the 

   ##### 

  

 

" _Parent Benefit Arrangements_ "), or (b) benefits under the Current Employee
Benefit Plans, all or some of which the Parent may continue to sponsor on and
after the Closing Date (the " _Continued Plans_ "). To the extent Parent
elects to provide employee benefits to the Continuing Employees and their
dependents, as applicable, pursuant to _clause (b)_ above, the Continuing
Employees shall be entitled to participate in the Continued Plans from and
after the Closing Date until such time that Parent suspends participation in
or terminates such Continued Plans (the " _Transition Period_ "); _provided_
, that in any event, the Continuing Employees shall be entitled to
participate in the Continued Plans for the remainder of the 2009 calendar
year. Upon the expiration of the Transition Period, the Continuing Employees
shall then be entitled to participate in the Parent Benefit Arrangements. To
the extent the Continuing Employees participate in a Parent Benefit
Arrangement, Parent shall, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is
relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual) under such Parent
Benefit Arrangement and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, provide
that such Continuing Employees shall receive service credit under such Parent
Benefit Arrangement for their period of service with the Company and
its Subsidiaries and predecessors prior to the Effective Time, except where
doing so would cause a duplication of benefits. Parent shall waive all
limitations as to preexisting condition exclusions (or actively at work or
similar limitations), evidence of insurability requirements and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements in
connection with the medical, dental and vision benefits that such Continuing
Employees may be eligible to receive pursuant to a Parent Benefit Arrangement
after the Effective Time. Parent shall also provide the Continuing Employees
with credit for any co-payments, deductibles and offsets made pursuant to the
applicable Current Employee Benefit Plans described in _Section 3.20(g)_ for
the purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
expenses under any Parent Benefit Arrangement in the calendar year, plan year
or policy year (as applicable under the terms of such Parent
Benefit Arrangement) in which the Effective Time occurs; _provided_ , that
such Continuing Employees shall timely provide Parent with back-up data with
respect to such co-payments, deductibles and offsets upon Parents request.
Any vacation or paid time off that is accrued and unused by a Continuing
Employee prior to the Effective Time shall be credited to such Continuing
Employee following the Effective Time and thereafter shall be carried forward
subject to Parents policies and procedures. Nothing in this _Section 5.10_
shall: (a) grant any rights or benefits to any Person other than the Parties
or (b) amend, or may be construed as amending, any Employee Benefit Plan or
Parent Benefit Arrangement.

In the event that, following such consideration, the Company Compensation Committee determines in good faith that such Post-Signing Arrangement constitutes an Employment Compensation Arrangement, at such meeting the Company Compensation Committee shall take all such steps as may be necessary to (i) approve as an Employment Compensation Arrangement such plan, program, agreement or arrangement and (ii) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program, agreement, arrangement, understanding, payment or benefit. 

   

 (c) At the time of any action by the Company Compensation Committee described in this  _Section 5.13_, each member of the Company Compensation Committee shall be an "independent director" in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 (a) _Termination Fee_. In the event that: 

   

 (i) (A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Company or shall have been made directly to its stockholders generally following the date of this Agreement, and thereafter (B) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ solely as a result of the failure to satisfy the Minimum Condition and (C) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates a transaction contemplated by, any Acquisition Proposal (replacing "10%" in the definition thereof with "66 2/3%") within 12 months of the date this Agreement is terminated;

 (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_; 

 

then in any such event under _clause (i)_, _(ii)_ or _(iii)_ of this 
_Section 7.3(a)_, the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of
$130,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "). Any payment of the Termination Fee

termination of this Agreement by Parent (or the Company, as applicable) as
set forth in such _clause (ii)_ (and in any event not later than
one Business Day after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for
payment); and any payment of the Termination Fee required to be made pursuant
to _clause (iii)_ of this _Section 7.3(a)_ shall be made to Parent at the
time provided for in _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_. 

   

 (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to  _Section 7.1(c)(iii)(B)_, then in any such event the Company shall pay to Parent the reasonable out of pocket fees and expenses (including legal and other third party advisors fees and expenses) actually incurred by Parent and its affiliates on or prior to the termination of this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement up to $40,000,000 (the " _Parent Expenses_ "). The Company shall pay to Parent the Parent Expenses as promptly as possible (but 

    ##### 

  

 

in any event within five Business Days) following receipt by the Company of an
invoice therefore. 

   

 (c) All such payments shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account to be designated by Parent or, if Parent fails to timely designate an account, by cashiers check payable to the order of Parent delivered to Parent at the address specified in  _Section 8.3_. 

   

 (d) Except as set forth in _Section 7.3(b)_, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated. 

   

 (e) In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee and/or Parent Expenses required pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ when due, such Termination Fee and/or Parent Expenses, as the case may be, shall accrue interest for the period commencing on the date such Termination Fee and/or Parent Expenses, as the case may be, became past due, at the rate of interest per annum equal to LIBOR plus 50 basis points from such date to the date of payment. In addition, if the Company shall fail to pay such Termination Fee and/or Parent Expenses, as the case may be, when due, the Company shall also pay to Parent all of Parents costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with efforts to collect such Termination Fee and/or Parent Expenses, as the case may be. 

   

 (f) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Each of the Parties acknowledges that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub for the costs, expenses, efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees on behalf of itself and its affiliates that in the event that the Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by the Company pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, the right to receive the Termination Fee shall constitute each of Parents and Merger Subs and each of their affiliates and Representatives sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)(C)_, in addition to the Termination Fee, the Company will not be relieved of any liability for damages to the extent set forth in  _Section 7.2_. 

   

 Section 7.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, subject to _Section 7.5_ and  _Section 1.4(b)_, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders, there may not be any extension or waiver of this Agreement which decreases the Merger Consideration or which adversely affects the rights of the Companys 

   ##### 

  

    

stockholders hereunder without the approval of such stockholders. Any
agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
Party. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights under
this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. 

  

 Section 7.5 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of directors (subject to _Section 1.4(b)_) at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after any approval of the Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment may be made without further stockholder approval which, by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further approval by such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the Parties.

 Section 8.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner materially adverse to Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement in a mutually acceptable manner so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible with respect to the consummation of the Merger. 

  

 Section 8.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Annexes, Exhibits, Company Disclosure Letter, the Employment Agreements, the Tender Agreements, the Non-Competition Agreements, the Amended License Agreement and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement of the Parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the Parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder. 

  

 Section 8.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Parties. No assignment by any Party shall relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 Section 8.7 _Mutual Drafting_. Each Party has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each Party acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the Parties. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if it is drafted by all the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 8.8 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and except as otherwise provided in  _Section 5.9_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit, or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 8.9 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage may occur in the event any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent 

   ##### 

  

    

breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at Law or equity. 

  

 Section 8.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. 

  

 Section 8.11 _Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section 8.11_, (b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. 

  

 Section 8.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 

  

 Section 8.13 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 8.14 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other

document made or delivered pursuant to this Agreement unless otherwise defined
therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement,
instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or
instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or
statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in
the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case
of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to
all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. 

  

 Section 8.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
