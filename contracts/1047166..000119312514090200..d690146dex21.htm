diligence review of Sellers and the Business (the " _Data Room Expense_ ");
_provided_ that the Data Room Expense shall be included in the Estimated

as described in _Section 2.8(a)_), which shall set forth the allocation of
the Data Room Expense among each Seller.

(d) All adjustments to the Purchase Price set forth in this Agreement shall

-27- 2.9 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Contemporaneous with the delivery of the
Calculated Closing Schedule, Buyers shall deliver to each Seller a written
schedule prepared in good faith by Buyers that allocates the portion of the
Purchase Price paid to each Seller among the Acquired Assets sold by such
Seller to the applicable Buyer (setting forth, among other things, the
allocation of the Purchase Price payable to Canadian Pump for Canadian
federal, provincial and local Tax purposes) for Sellers review and approval
(with respect to each Seller, an " _Allocation Schedule_ "). Such Allocation
Schedule shall be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code.
Sellers shall have thirty (30) days after Buyers delivery to Sellers of the
Allocation Schedule during which to notify Buyers in writing of any dispute
of any allocation, item, calculation or other matter contained in the
Allocation Schedule, which Allocation Dispute Notice shall set forth a
description of the dispute and the adjustments to the Allocation
Schedule that Sellers believe should be made (an " _Allocation Dispute
Notice_ "). If Sellers do not deliver an Allocation Dispute Notice to Buyers
within such 30-day period or if Sellers at any time during such 30-day period
notify Buyers in writing that Sellers agree with the Allocation Schedule in
its entirety, then the Allocation Schedule shall become final and binding on
all parties hereto. In the event that Sellers deliver an Allocation Dispute
Notice to Buyers within such 30-day period, Sellers and Buyers shall
cooperate in good faith to resolve any dispute(s) specified therein as
promptly as possible, and any resolution by them as to any item, calculation
or other matter specified in the Dispute Notice shall be final and binding on
the parties hereto. If an Allocation Schedule becomes final, Sellers and
Buyers shall prepare jointly a Form 8594, in conformity with such final
Allocation Schedule. Buyers and Sellers shall attach such Form 8594 to their
respective tax returns for the 2014 tax year, and to the extent that the
Purchase Price is adjusted, revise and amend the Allocation Schedule and Form
8594 as necessary. A final Allocation Schedule shall be binding on Sellers and
Buyers for all Tax reporting purposes and neither Buyers nor Sellers (or any
of their respective Affiliates) shall take any position (whether in audits,
Tax Returns or otherwise) which is inconsistent with such allocation unless
required to do so by applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ , that nothing
contained herein shall prevent Buyers or Sellers from settling any proposed
deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority based upon or arising
out of the Allocation Schedule, and neither Buyers nor Sellers shall be
required to litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by
any Governmental Authority challenging such Allocation Schedule.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Sellers and Buyers do not finalize an
Allocation Schedule by agreement (or agree to revise and amend an Allocation
Schedule), neither Buyers nor Sellers shall be bound by any Allocation
Schedule, and each may prepare, revise and file its own Form 8594.

 

2.10 _Post-Closing Adjustments to the Purchase Price_.

 

(a) Within 150 days following the Closing Date, Buyers shall prepare and
deliver to Sellers a schedule prepared in good faith by Buyers (the "
_Calculated Closing Schedule_ "), which shall set forth Buyers calculation,
as of 12:01 A.M., New York City time, on the Closing Date, of:

 

(i) the Net Working Capital (including each component thereof) of each of
National Pump (the " _Calculated National Pump Net Working Capital_ "),
Canadian Pump (the " _Calculated Canadian Pump Net Working Capital_ ") and
GulfCo (the " _Calculated GulfCo Net Working Capital_ ");

 



-28- (ii) the aggregate amount (including each component thereof) of Indebtedness
of each of National Pump (the " _Calculated National Pump Indebtedness
Amount_ "), Canadian Pump (the " _Calculated Canadian Pump Indebtedness
Amount_ "), LD Services (the " _Calculated LD Services Indebtedness Amount_ ")
and GulfCo (the " _Calculated GulfCo Indebtedness Amount_ ");

(iii) the aggregate amount (including each component thereof) of each of the
National Pump Fleet Reimbursement (such calculation thereof, the " _Calculated
National Pump Fleet Reimbursement_ "), the Canadian Pump Fleet Reimbursement
(such calculation thereof, the " _Calculated Canadian Pump Fleet
Reimbursement_ ") and the GulfCo Fleet Reimbursement (such calculation
thereof, the " _Calculated GulfCo Fleet Reimbursement_ "); and

 

(iv) the Replacement Cost with respect to each of National Pump (the "
_National Pump Replacement Cost_ "), Canadian Pump (the " _Canadian Pump
Replacement Cost_ ") and GulfCo (the " _GulfCo Replacement Cost_ "), if any.

Buyers will prepare calculations of each of the amounts referenced in this
_Section 2.10(a)_ in good faith and in accordance with this _Section
2.10(a)_, _Exhibit C_ and the Agreed Principles. Buyers will provide to
Sellers and their accountants and/or representatives, at Buyers expense and
subject to the reasonable rules and regulations of Buyers, reasonable
documentation detailing the calculations and other information required to be
included in the Calculated Closing Schedule and its components, together with
such additional information as Sellers may reasonably request; _provided_ that
Sellers shall and shall cause any of their accountants and/or representatives
to treat any information gained thereby as confidential.

(b) Sellers shall have thirty (30) days after Buyers delivery to Sellers of
the Calculated Closing Schedule during which to notify Buyers in writing (a "
_Dispute Notice_ ") of any dispute of any item, calculation or other matter
contained in the Calculated Closing Schedule, which Dispute Notice shall set
forth a description of the dispute and the adjustments to the Calculated
Closing Schedule that Sellers believe should be made. If Sellers deliver a
Dispute Notice during such 30-day period, then only those items, calculations
or other matters that are specified in such Dispute Notice shall be deemed in
dispute and all other items, calculations or other matters shall be final and
binding upon the parties hereto. If Sellers fail to deliver a Dispute Notice
to Buyers within such 30-day period or if Sellers at any time during such
30-day period notify Buyers in writing that Sellers agree with the Calculated
Closing Schedule in its entirety, then the Calculated Closing Schedule shall
become final and binding on all parties hereto and shall be deemed to be
the Final Closing Schedule. In the event that Sellers deliver a Dispute
Notice to Buyers within such 30-day period, Sellers and Buyers shall cooperate
in good faith to resolve any dispute(s) specified therein as promptly as
possible, and any resolution by them as to any item, calculation or other
matter specified in the Dispute Notice shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto. Buyers and their accountants and/or representatives shall be
provided full access to all information used by Sellers in preparing a
Dispute Notice, including the work papers of the accountants of Sellers.

(c) If Buyers and Sellers are unable to resolve any dispute specified in a
Dispute Notice within thirty (30) days of Sellers delivery of such Dispute
Notice, such dispute shall be resolved by a jointly selected nationally
recognized accounting firm (the " _Independent_  

 



-29-   _Accounting Firm_ ") retained by Sellers and Buyers to resolve any
remaining disputes between Buyers and Sellers specified in the Dispute Notice.
The Independent Accounting Firm, acting as experts and not as arbitrators,
shall determine, in accordance with the Agreed Principles, and only with
respect to the remaining disputed items, calculations or other matters
specified in the Dispute Notice, whether and to what extent, if any, the
Calculated Closing Schedule requires adjustment. In resolving any disputed
item or other matter specified in a Dispute Notice, the Independent Accounting
Firm may not assign a value to any item or matter greater than the greatest
value for such item or matter claimed by either party or less than the
smallest value for such item or matter claimed by either party. If Sellers and
Buyers cannot jointly agree on an Independent Accounting Firm, Sellers and
Buyers shall each submit to their respective accountants the name of an
accounting firm (which shall not be either of their respective accounting
firms), and the Independent Accounting Firm shall be selected by lot from
these two firms by the respective accountants of the two parties. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall be instructed by Buyers and Sellers to use
every reasonable effort to perform its services within thirty (30) days after
submission of the Calculated Closing Schedule and the Dispute Notice to
it and, in any case, as soon as practicable after submission. The Independent
Accounting Firms determination shall be final and binding upon the parties
hereto. Sellers and Buyers shall make readily available to the Independent
Accounting Firm all relevant books and records and any work papers (including
those of the parties respective accountants) relating to the Estimated
Closing Schedule and Dispute Notice and all other items reasonably requested
by the Independent Accounting Firm in connection therewith. The " _Final
Closing Schedule_ " shall be deemed to be (i) the Calculated Closing Schedule
if no Dispute Notice is delivered by Sellers within the 30-day period
specified in  _Section 2.10(b)_, (ii) the Calculated Closing Schedule if
Sellers notify Buyers in writing that Sellers agree with the Calculated
Closing Schedule in its entirety at any time during the 30-day period
specified in  _Section 2.10(b)_, or (iii) if a Dispute Notice is delivered
by Sellers within the 30-day period specified in _Section 2.10(b)_, the
Calculated Closing Schedule as adjusted by (A) the written agreement of
Sellers and Buyers and/or (B) the written determination of the Independent
Accounting Firm. The Final Closing Schedule shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto. One-half (1/2) of any fees and expenses relating to the
engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by each of
Buyers, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand.

(d) Within five (5) Business Days after the date on which the Calculated
Closing Schedule becomes the Final Closing Schedule in accordance with
_Section 2.10(c)_, a cash adjustment to each of the National Pump Closing
Cash Payment, the Canadian Pump Closing Cash Payment, the LD Services Closing
Cash Payment and the GulfCo Closing Cash Payment shall be made, on a dollar-
for-dollar basis, as follows:

 

(i) In the event that the Final National Pump Payment exceeds the National
Pump Closing Cash Payment (the amount of such difference, the " _National
Pump Positive Amount_ "), Buyers shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the applicable account(s) set forth on the Disbursement
Schedule, an aggregate amount equal to the National Pump Positive Amount. In
the event the Final National Pump Payment is less than the National Pump
Closing Cash Payment (the amount of such difference, the " _National Pump
Negative Amount_ "), then Sellers shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, to Buyers an aggregate amount equal to the National Pump
Negative Amount.

 



-30- (ii) In the event that the Final Canadian Pump Payment exceeds the Canadian
Pump Closing Cash Payment (the amount of such difference, the " _Canadian
Pump Positive Amount_ "), Buyers shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the applicable account(s) set forth on the Disbursement
Schedule, an aggregate amount equal to the Canadian Pump Positive Amount. In
the event the Final Canadian Pump Payment is less than the Canadian Pump
Closing Cash Payment (the amount of such difference, the " _Canadian Pump
Negative Amount_ "), then Sellers shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, to Buyers an aggregate amount equal to the Canadian Pump
Negative Amount.

(iii) In the event that the Final LD Services Payment exceeds the LD Services
Closing Cash Payment (the amount of such difference, the " _LD Services
Positive Amount_ "), Buyers shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the applicable account(s) set forth on the Disbursement
Schedule, an aggregate amount equal to the LD Services Positive Amount. In the
event the Final LD Services Payment is less than the LD Services Closing Cash
Payment (the amount of such difference, the " _LD Services Negative Amount_
"), then Sellers shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
to Buyers an aggregate amount equal to the LD Services Negative Amount.

 

(iv) In the event that the Final GulfCo Payment exceeds the GulfCo Closing
Cash Payment (the amount of such difference, the " _GulfCo Positive Amount_
"), Buyers shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
applicable account(s) set forth on the Disbursement Schedule, an aggregate
amount equal to the GulfCo Positive Amount. In the event the Final
GulfCo Payment is less than the GulfCo Closing Cash Payment (the amount of
such difference, the " _GulfCo Negative Amount_ "), then Sellers shall pay, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, to Buyers an aggregate amount
equal to the GulfCo Negative Amount.

(v) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, if: (A)
the aggregate amount of (x) the Final National Pump Fleet Reimbursement,
_plus_ (y) the Final Canadian Pump Fleet Reimbursement, exceeds the Pump
Reimbursement Cap, any portion of such amount in excess of the Pump
Reimbursement Cap shall be disregarded for purposes of the adjustment to the
Purchase Price; and (B) the Final GulfCo Fleet Reimbursement exceeds
$2,500,000.00, any portion of such amount in excess of $2,500,000.00 shall be
disregarded for purposes of the adjustment to the Purchase Price.

(vi) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, any amount of the Holdback Amount may be used to satisfy any amount
due to Buyers under _Section 8.2_, without regard to the allocation of the
Holdback Amount among Sellers for purposes of the Closing Cash Payment.

 

(vii) No single item will be given duplicative effect when calculating the
various adjustments to the Purchase Price under this  _Section 2.10(d)_.

2.11 _Holdback_.

 

(a) As provided in _Section 2.8(b)_, the Holdback Amount is being withheld by
Buyers for the purpose of allowing Buyers to recover therefrom the amount of
any claims for indemnification Buyers or any Buyer Indemnitee may have against
Sellers pursuant to _Section 8.2_.

 



-31- (b) Buyers shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
balance of the Holdback Amount, if any, to the accounts designated for each
Seller on the Disbursement Schedule for payment of the Closing Cash Payment on
the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date; _provided_ that in
the event Buyers or any Buyer Indemnitee has any claims for indemnification
against Sellers under _Section 8.2_ for which Buyers have given notice to
Sellers in accordance with the terms herein, Buyers shall continue to withhold
the portion of the Holdback Amount subject to such claims until the parties
fully and finally resolve such claims.

2.12 _Earnout_.

 

(a) _Earnout Payment_. As part of the Purchase Price, Buyers shall pay or
cause to be paid to each of the Pump Entities the First Earnout Amount and
the Second Earnout Amount as determined in accordance with this _Section
2.12_ (such aggregate payment, the " _Earnout Payment_ ") by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by each respective
Pump Entity to Buyers at least two Business Days prior to the date the Earnout
Payment is required to be paid. If a Pump Entity does not designate an account
in accordance with this _Section 2.12(a)_, such wire transfer shall be made
to the account(s) designated for such Pump Entity on the Disbursement
Schedule. Each of the First Earnout Amount and the Second Earnout Amount shall
be allocated among the Pump Entities as follows: (x) 82.933% to National
Pump, (y) 13.400% to Canadian Pump and (z) 3.667% to LD Services.

(b) _First Earnout Amount_. With respect to the First Calculation Period,
Buyers shall pay or cause to be paid to the Pump Entities an amount (such
aggregate amount, the " _First Earnout Amount_ ") equal to the greater of (i)
the amount that is equal to (A) the product of (1) the difference of (x) the
EBITDA of the Pump Business during the First Calculation Period _minus_ (y)
$100,000,000.00, _times_ (2) 4.116, _minus_ (B) the amount that is equal to
(1) the sum of the Final National Pump Fleet Reimbursement _plus_ the Final
Canadian Pump Fleet Reimbursement, _plus_ (2) the difference between the
aggregate amount of Rental Capital Expenditures by the Pump Business during
the First Calculation Period  _minus_ the aggregate amount of the original
equipment cost with respect to any and all Rental Equipment sold by the Pump
Business in an arms-length transaction during the First Calculation Period,
and (ii) $0; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the First Earnout Amount shall be
$0 unless the EBITDA of the Pump Business during the First Calculation Period
is equal to or greater than $110,000,000.00; _provided_ _further_ , that under
no circumstances shall the First Earnout Amount exceed $75,000,000.00. An
illustrative example of the calculation of the First Earnout Amount is
attached hereto as _Exhibit E_. The First Earnout Amount, if any, shall be
paid to each Pump Entity pursuant to  _Section 2.12(a)_ upon the later to
occur of (i) forty-five (45) days following the date that is twelve (12)
months after the date of the Closing and (ii) two Business Days following the
resolution of all disputed matters properly included in an Earnout Statement
Objection Notice in accordance with _Section 2.12(f)_.

(c) _Second Earnout Amount_. With respect to the Second Calculation Period,
Buyers shall pay or cause to be paid to the Pump Entities an amount (the "
_Second Earnout_

 



-32-   _Amount_ ") equal to the greater of (i) the amount that is equal to (A) the
product of (1) the difference of (x) the EBITDA of the Pump Business during
the Second Calculation Period, _minus_ (y) $142,000,000.00, _times_ (2) 4.0,
_minus_ (B) the amount that is equal to (1) the sum of Final National Pump
Fleet Reimbursement _plus_ the Final Canadian Pump Fleet Reimbursement,
_plus_ (2) the difference between the aggregate amount of Rental Capital
Expenditures by the Pump Business during the 18-month period following the
Closing Date _minus_ the aggregate amount of the original equipment cost with
respect to any and all Rental Equipment sold by the Pump Business in an arms-
length transaction during such 18-month period, _minus_ (3) $60,000,000.00,
and (ii) $0; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Second Earnout Amount shall be
$0 unless the EBITDA of the Pump Business during the Second Calculation Period
is equal to or greater than $143,000,000.00; _provided_ _further_ , that under
no circumstances shall the Second Earnout Amount exceed $50,000,000.00;
_provided_ _further_ , that in the event the amount referenced in Section
_2.12(c)(i)(B)(2)_ exceeds $60,000,000.00, prior to any further purchases of
Rental Equipment, the Seller Representative and Buyers shall mutually agree
to any such further purchases and shall discuss in good faith adjustments to
the calculation of the Second Earnout Amount as set forth in this _Section
2.12(c)_, so as to not unfairly penalize either party due to the timing of
such purchases. An illustrative example of the calculation of the Second
Earnout Amount is attached hereto as _Exhibit E_. The Second Earnout Amount,
if any, shall be paid to the applicable Pump Entity pursuant to  _Section
2.12(a)_ in the first quarter of the year 2016 on a date mutually agreed to
between Buyers and the Seller Representative in writing ( _provided_ that
under no circumstances shall such payment of the Second Earnout Amount,
if any, be paid prior to the resolution of any and all disputed matters with
respect thereto).

(d) Within fifteen (15) days following each of the First Calculation Period
and the Second Calculation Period, Buyers shall prepare and deliver to the
Seller Representative a statement (an " _Earnout Statement_ ") setting forth
their good faith calculation of the First Earnout Amount or the Second
Earnout Amount, as the case may be, including each component thereof. The
calculations made pursuant to this _Section 2.12(d)_ shall be prepared in
accordance with this Agreement and the Agreed Principles and shall be
accompanied by any financial statements of the Business used in calculating
EBITDA.

(e) The Seller Representative must give written notice to Buyers (an "
_Earnout Statement Objection Notice_ ") specifying in reasonable detail
Sellers objections to any amount reflected on the applicable Earnout
Statement within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such Earnout Statement.
Any item on an Earnout Statement to which the Seller Representative does not
timely object in an Earnout Statement Objection Notice will be deemed to be
accepted by Sellers, and any amounts included within such item will be deemed
to be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. If the Seller
Representative does not deliver to an Earnout Statement Objection Notice
within such 15-day period, then Buyers determinations of the amounts on the
applicable Earnout Statement will be final, binding and conclusive on the
parties hereto.

(f) If the Seller Representative delivers to Buyers an Earnout Statement
Objection Notice within fifteen (15) days after receipt of an Earnout
Statement, then Buyers and the Seller Representative shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve any disputed items concerning such Earnout Statement for the
fifteen (15) days after receipt of the Earnout Statement Objection Notice, and
any such items (and any amounts included within such items) resolved during
such negotiations will be final, binding and conclusive on the parties
hereto.

 



-33- (g) If Buyers and the Seller Representative are unable to resolve all disputed
items within the 15-day period set forth in _Section 2.12(f)_, then Buyers
and the Seller Representative will submit only those items remaining in
dispute for resolution to the Independent Accounting Firm. Buyers and the
Seller Representative will, and will cause their respective accountants to,
cooperate fully with the Independent Accounting Firm and to facilitate its
resolution of the dispute, including by providing and explaining as requested
the information, data and work papers (including those of the parties
respective accountants) used to prepare the applicable Earnout Statement, the
applicable Earnout Statement Objection Notice and their interpretation of the
dispute. The Independent Accounting Firm will determine and report to Buyers
and the Seller Representative its determination on the remaining disputed
items submitted for resolution (and only such remaining disputed items
submitted for resolution) within fifteen (15) Business Days after the dispute
is submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm, and the Independent
Accounting Firms determination will be final, binding and conclusive on the
parties hereto. One-half (1/2) of any fees, costs and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by each of Buyers, on the one
hand, and Sellers, on the other hand.

(h) After delivery of an Earnout Statement, each of Buyers, on the one hand,
and the Seller Representative, on the other hand, will provide the other party
and its accountants and/or representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours and without significant disruption to their respective
business (i) to the books and records containing information directly relevant
to such Earnout Statement or an Earnout Statement Objection Notice, as
applicable, and (ii) to its employees, accountants or other
representatives responsible for preparing such Earnout Statement or the
Earnout Statement Objection Notice, as applicable, provided that in no event
shall either party be required to provide access to, or be deemed to have
waived any privilege with respect to, any books, records or other information
that it reasonably believes is privileged.

2.13 _Accounts Receivable_. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in
this Agreement, in the event that Buyers accept payments, during the period of
time extending 180 days following the date on which the Calculated Closing
Schedule becomes the Final Closing Schedule in accordance with  _Section
2.10(c)_, in connection with any Uncollected Accounts Receivable which have
been excluded from Current Assets in the calculation of Net Working Capital,
Buyers shall promptly submit any such payments to Sellers. Buyers and
Sellers agree to discuss the assignment of any Uncollected Accounts
Receivable for collection to the applicable Seller(s), including the timing of
any such assignment and the circumstances under which any such assignment
shall be made.

 

2.14 _Withholding_. Buyers may deduct and withhold from any consideration
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any Seller or any Owner such
amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld from such consideration
under the Code, the Income Tax Act (Canada) or any provision of any Tax-
related Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid.

 



-34- 2.15 _Affiliate Acquisitions_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Buyers may elect to have any or all of the
Acquired Assets conveyed or transferred to, or any of the Assumed Liabilities
assumed by, one or more of their Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such election shall relieve Buyers of any of their liabilities and
obligations to Sellers hereunder. The Purchase Price shall be allocated among
those Acquired Assets to be conveyed to Buyers and those Acquired Assets to be
conveyed to the respective Affiliate(s) of Buyers, but in no event shall the
amount of the Purchase Price or any other items to be paid for the Acquired
Assets, the nature of the Assumed Liabilities to be assumed, the obligation to
pay Taxes or Transfer Taxes or the allocation of risk and responsibility
between Sellers and Buyers hereunder be modified.

2.16 _Securities Act Compliance_.

 

(a) The shares of Restricted Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement
shall not be registered under the Securities Act in reliance on
the exemptions from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the
Securities Act set forth in Section 4(2) thereof.

(b) The shares of Restricted Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement
shall be characterized as "restricted securities" for purposes of Rule 144
under the Securities Act, and each certificate representing any such share
shall, until such time that the shares of Restricted Stock are not so
restricted under the Securities Act, bear a legend identical or similar in
effect to the following legend (together with any other legend or legends
required by applicable state securities laws or otherwise, if any): "THE

ARTICLE 4

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS AND OWNERS_

 

Except as expressly set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of
the Disclosure Schedules delivered to Buyers concurrently with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, each Seller jointly and severally, and each
Owner, with respect to _Sections 4.1(a)(ii)_, _4.1(b)(ii)_ , _4.5(g)_ and
_4.5(j)_ , severally, represents and warrants to Buyers that the statements
contained in this _Article 4_ are true and correct as of the date hereof and
as of the Closing Date, as set forth below:

 

4.1 _Sellers and Owners_.

 

(a) _Organization and Good Standing_.

 

(i) _Sellers_. LD Services is a limited liability company duly formed and
validly existing under the laws of Texas and has an active right to transact
business in the State of Texas. Each of National Pump and GulfCo is a limited
partnership duly formed and validly existing under the laws of Texas and has
an active right to transact business in the State of Texas. Canadian Pump
is a corporation duly incorporated, organized and validly existing under the
laws of the Province of Alberta and is in good standing under such laws. Each
Seller has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate all
properties and assets owned or leased by it and to conduct the Business as
currently conducted by it. Each of LD Services, National Pump and GulfCo is
qualified to do business and has an active right to transact business

  



-38-  in the State of Texas, and is qualified to do business in all other
jurisdictions that it is required to be qualified, except where a failure to
be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect. Canadian Pump is extra-provincially registered in the Province
of British Columbia, and neither the nature of the Business currently
conducted by it nor the location or character of any of its assets
or operations requires Canadian Pump to be registered, licensed or otherwise
qualified as an extra-provincial or foreign corporation or to be in good
standing in any other jurisdiction, except where a failure to be so
registered, licensed or otherwise qualified or to be in good standing would
not have a Material Adverse Effect. Other than Canadian Pump, none of the
other Sellers carries on any business in Canada for purposes of the Investment
Canada Act.

 

(ii) _Owners_. If any Owner is a Person other than a natural person, such
Owner is duly organized or formed, validly existing and, to the extent such
concept is recognized, in good standing or has an active right to transact
business under the Legal Requirements of its jurisdiction of organization or
formation.

 

(b) _Validity and Authorization; Power and Authority_.

 

(i) _Sellers_. Each Seller has all necessary corporate, limited partnership or
limited liability company power and authority, as the case may be, to execute
and deliver this Agreement, the Related Agreements and the other instruments
called for hereby to which it is a party, and to perform its obligations
hereunder and thereunder. This Agreement and each Related Agreement to which
any Seller is a party has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate,
limited partnership or limited liability company action, as the case may be,
executed and delivered by each such Seller, and each such agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Seller,
enforceable against such Seller in accordance with its respective terms.

(ii) _Owners_. If any Owner is a Person other than a natural person: (A) such
Owner has all necessary corporate, limited liability company, partnership or
trust power and authority, as the case may be, to execute and deliver this
Agreement and the Related Agreements to which it is or will be a party, and
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; and (B) the
execution and delivery by such Owner of this Agreement and the Related
Agreements to which it is or will be a party, and the consummation by such
Owner of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and
validly authorized by all required corporate, limited liability company or
partnership, as applicable, action on the part of such Owner and no
other corporate, limited liability company or partnership, as applicable,
proceedings on the part of such Owner are necessary to authorize the execution
and delivery by such Owner of this Agreement and the Related Agreements or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby by such Owner. If
any Owner is a natural person, such Owner has all necessary power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations
hereunder.

 

(c) _Capitalization of Sellers; Subsidiaries_.

 

(i) Disclosure Schedule 4.1(c) sets forth a complete and accurate table of the
Equity Interests of each Seller, and the Persons that hold such Equity
Interests, as of

 



-39-  the date hereof. The Equity Interests constitute all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of Sellers. The Equity
Interests have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable, were issued in compliance with all applicable Legal
Requirements and have not been issued and were not issued in violation of any
preemptive or other similar rights. There are no preemptive or
other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock
appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments of any kind (absolute, contingent or otherwise),
under which any Seller is or may become obligated to issue or sell, or giving
any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, or in any way dispose of, any
Equity Interests, or any securities or obligations exercisable or exchangeable
for or convertible into any Equity Interests of any Seller, and no securities
or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding.
There are (A) no outstanding or authorized stock appreciation, phantom stock,
profit participation or other equity-based compensation or similar rights
(other than stock options) with respect to any Seller or the value or price of
the Equity Interests of any Seller, and (B) no restrictions upon, or voting
trusts, proxies or other agreements or understandings of any kind
with respect to the voting, purchase, redemption, acquisition or transfer of,
or the declaration or payment of any dividend or distribution on, the Equity
Interests of any Seller.

 

(ii) No Seller owns, controls, or has voting rights with respect to, directly
or indirectly, any interest in any other corporation, partnership,
association or other business entity, and no Seller is a party to any
agreement relating to the acquisition or disposition of such an interest.

 

(d) _No Conflict_.

(i)  _Sellers_. Neither the execution, delivery or performance by Sellers of
this Agreement or the Related Agreements to which any Seller is a party, nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will (A)
result in any violation or breach of the terms of, contravene or conflict
with or constitute a default under, in each case, the certificate of formation
or other equivalent organizational document or the operating agreement,
limited liability company agreement, agreement of limited partnership or
other governing document of any Seller, as the case may be, (B) result in any
violation or breach of the terms of, or contravene or conflict with, any Legal

terms of, contravene or conflict with, accelerate the performance of the
obligations required under, constitute a default under, give any right of, or

applicable to any Seller or to which any Seller is a party or by which any
Seller or its property or assets are bound or affected (assuming the receipt
of all Seller Consents set forth in Disclosure Schedule 4.1(e)). Neither the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the Related
Agreements to which any Seller is a party, nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will result in the creation of
any Lien (other than any Permitted Lien) upon any of the Acquired Assets.

(ii) _Owners_. Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement or the Related Agreements, nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated

 



-40-  hereby or thereby will (A) result in any violation or breach of the terms
of, or contravene or conflict with, any Legal Requirement (assuming the
receipt of all Seller Consents set forth in Disclosure Schedule 4.1(e)), (B)
result in any violation of the terms of, contravene or conflict with,
accelerate the performance of the obligations required under, constitute a
default under, give any right of, or result in, the termination, cancellation
or acceleration under or give any right to make, or result in, the change in
any of the liabilities or obligations under, in each case, any agreement,
contract, note, bond, debenture, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, lease,
license or other restriction applicable to any Owner or to which any Owner is
a party or by which any Owner or his property or assets are bound or affected
(assuming the receipt of all Seller Consents set forth in Disclosure Schedule
4.1(e)), or (C) in the case such Owner is a Person other than a natural
person, will result in any violation or breach of the terms of, contravene or
conflict with or constitute a default under, in each case, the certificate of
formation or other equivalent organizational document or the operating
agreement, limited liability company agreement, agreement of limited
partnership or other governing document of such Owner, as the case may be.

 

(e) _Seller Consents Required_. Disclosure Schedule 4.1(e) lists all Seller
Consents. Except as set forth on Disclosure Schedule 4.1(e), no consent,
approval, waiver, authorization, notice or filing is required to be obtained
by any Seller or any of its Affiliates from, or to be given by any Seller or
any of its Affiliates to, or made by any Seller or any of its Affiliates
with, any Governmental Authority or any other Person in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by Sellers, Owners or any of their
respective Affiliates of this Agreement and the Related Agreements.

contains true and correct copies of (i) the Annual Financial Statements and
(ii) the unaudited internally generated, balance sheet (the " _Interim Balance

Balance Sheet, the " _Interim Financial Statements_ ", and together with the
Annual Financial Statements, the " _Financial Statements_ ").

 

The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with Agreed
Principles and fairly present, in all material respects, the
financial position of each Seller as of the dates thereof and the results of
each Sellers operations and cash flows for the periods then ended. Each
Seller maintains a standard system of accounting, including without limitation
internal accounting controls, established and administered in accordance with
GAAP. There are no off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations,
or relationships attributable to the Business that may have a
Material Adverse Effect on the financial condition, results of operations,
liquidity or capital resources, of the Business.

Each Sellers books and records (including without limitation, all financial
records, business records, minute books, equity transfer records, client

complete and correct in all material respects and all transactions to which

suffered the loss of service of any directors, employees, consultants,
independent contractors or agents who are material, individually or in the
aggregate, to the operations or conduct of each such Seller.

4.3 _Assets; Title_.

 

(a) _Personal Property_.

 

(i) _Title_. Each Seller is the sole owner of the assets reflected in its
respective Annual Financial Statements and has good, valid and marketable
title to, or a valid and subsisting leasehold interest, sublease interest or
other comparable contract right in, all Personal Property of such Seller that
is included in the Acquired Assets free and clear of all Liens, except
for Permitted Liens. With respect to any Personal Property that is leased by
any Seller, each such Seller is in compliance, in all material respects, with
each such lease and is the sole holder of actual and exclusive possession of
all leasehold interests, free and clear of any Liens, other than Permitted
Liens. Disclosure Schedule 4.3(a)(i) lists each lease agreement, service

as set forth on Disclosure Schedule 4.3(a)(ii), all Inventory is located at
the Leased Premises, with third-party vendors or on service vehicles of any
Seller.

 

(iii) _Equipment_. Disclosure Schedule 4.3(a)(iii)(1) lists all Equipment
(including any IT Assets) that are included in the Acquired Assets. For each
such item of Equipment, Disclosure Schedule 4.3(a)(iii)(1) includes the make,

usable in the Ordinary Course of Business, is in good working order and
condition (normal wear and tear excepted) or, in the case of any item of
Rental Equipment, each such item of Rental Equipment is Rental Ready, is in
conformity with all applicable Legal Requirements, express and implied
warranties, product and service specifications and quality standards
customary to the Business. Except as set forth on Disclosure Schedule
4.3(a)(iii)(2), all items of Equipment and other IT Assets listed on
Disclosure Schedule 4.3(a)(iii)(1) have been, to Sellers Knowledge,
maintained in a manner that is consistent with standards customary for the
Business, and are, in all material respects, in compliance with all applicable
Legal Requirements.

 

(iv) _Personal Property Taxes_. With respect to the Personal Property, there
are no disputes or appeals pending regarding the amount of Property Taxes, or
the assessed valuation of the Personal Property, and no special arrangements
or agreements exist with any Governmental Authority with respect to Property
Taxes; _provided_ that the representations and warranties contained in this
paragraph (iv) shall not be deemed to be breached by any prospective general

Tax assessments, there is no Property Tax assessment pending or, to
any Sellers Knowledge, threatened with respect to any portion of the
Personal Property.

(v) _Notes and Accounts Receivable_. All notes payable to, and Accounts
Receivable of, each Seller were created in the Ordinary Course of Business
and, except to the extent billed, paid or credited prior to the Closing Date,
are, or will be, enforceable against payor in the amounts thereof reflected
in the books and records of such Seller, net of reserves or contractual
allowances reflected in such Sellers Annual Financial Statements. Payments to
each Seller in respect of Accounts Receivable are deposited, upon receipt,
directly into the Bank Accounts and such amounts can only be withdrawn
therefrom by such Seller or its duly authorized agents. To each Sellers
Knowledge, none of the Accounts Receivable is or was subject to any
counterclaim or set-off. All of such Accounts Receivable arose out of bona
fide, arms-length transactions. No Seller has any outstanding sales on
consignment, sales on approval, or guaranteed sales. Disclosure Schedule
4.3(a)(v) includes an aging report for all Accounts Receivable (excluding
accrued but unbilled revenues) as of a date not earlier than two Business Days
prior to the date hereof.

to, or a valid and binding leasehold interest in, the Real Property (to the

except Permitted Liens. Disclosure Schedule 4.3(b)(i) identifies (A) that
certain tract of land, together with the building(s) located thereon, owned by
LD Services having a street address of 3405 West Cardinal Drive, Beaumont,
Jefferson County, Texas 77705 (the " _Owned Real Property_ "), and (B) each
Assigned Lease.

 



-43- (ii) Sellers have made available to Buyers complete and accurate copies of
each of the Assigned Leases, including all amendments thereto, and any
documents or instruments affecting the rights or obligations of any of the
parties thereto. No unwritten amendments or waivers exist to or under any
Assigned Lease, and the Owned Real Property is not subject to any lease,
license or sublicense. Each Assigned Lease is in full force and effect and is
enforceable, in all material respects, in accordance with its terms. No Seller
is in breach or default of the Assigned Leases thereunder and, to Sellers
Knowledge, no event has occurred that with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both, would constitute such a breach or default by any Seller under such
Assigned Leases or permit termination, acceleration or material modification
of such Assigned Leases. No party to any Assigned Lease has repudiated any
provision thereof and, to the Knowledge of Sellers, there are no material
disputes, oral agreements or forbearance programs in effect as to such
Assigned Leases.

 

(iii) The Owned Real Property, and to Sellers Knowledge, the Leased Premises:
(A) is, in all material respects, in good operating condition and repair,
ordinary wear and tear excepted, structurally sound and free of defects, with
no material alterations or repairs required thereto under applicable Legal
Requirements or insurance company requirements; and (B) is suitable in all
material respects for its current use, operation and occupancy.

(iv) The ownership, occupancy, use and operation of the Owned Real Property
and, only with respect to Sellers use and operation of the Leased Premises,
the Leased Premises has complied and complies in all material respects with
all Legal Requirements and Governmental Authorizations, except for failures
to comply or violations that would not have a Material Adverse Effect, and
does not violate in any material respect any instrument of record or agreement
affecting such Owned Real Property.

 

(v) There are no pending, or to Sellers Knowledge, threatened, appropriation,
condemnation, eminent domain or like proceedings relating to the Owned Real
Property or, to Sellers Knowledge, the Leased Premises.

(vi) None of the Owned Real Property or the Leased Premises have suffered any
material damage by fire or other casualty which has not heretofore been
repaired and restored in all material respects, except for damage that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the conduct of the
Business.

(vii) None of the Owned Real Property or, to Sellers Knowledge, the Leased
Premises, or the conduct by any Seller of the Business thereon, (A) are in
material violation of any building line or use or occupancy restriction,
limitation, condition or covenant of record or any zoning or building law,
code or ordinance or public utility or other easement or (B) encroach on the
property rights of any other Person, _provided_ that this clause (B) shall be
qualified by Sellers Knowledge with respect to each of the Owned Real
Property and the Leased Premises. Each facility located on the Owned Real
Property or the Leased Premises currently is served by gas, electricity,
water, sewage and waste disposal and other utilities necessary to operate such
facility for its current use, and to Sellers Knowledge none of the
utility companies

 



-44-  serving any such facility has notified any Seller of a material reduction in
service. The continued maintenance and operation of the Owned Real Property,
and to Sellers Knowledge, the Leased Premises, as currently maintained and
operated is not dependent on facilities, Equipment or other assets located at
other real property, and the continued maintenance and operation of any other
property is not dependent on facilities, Equipment or other assets located on
the Owned Real Property or, to Sellers Knowledge, the Leased Premises.

(viii) Except as set forth on Disclosure Schedule 4.3(b)(viii), all land,
buildings, facilities, offices or improvements on real estate owned or leased
by each Seller and used by Sellers in the conduct of the Business have been
maintained in accordance with practices that are commercially reasonable for
the Business, and such practices are, in all material respects, in compliance
with all applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(ix) _Real Property Taxes_. There are no challenges or appeals pending
regarding the amount of the Property Taxes on, or the assessed valuation of,
the Owned Real Property or, to Sellers Knowledge, the Leased Premises, and no
special arrangements or agreements exist with any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Owned Real Property or, to Sellers Knowledge, the Leased
Premises (the representations and warranties contained in this paragraph (ix)
shall not be deemed to be breached by any prospective general increase in
Property Tax rates). There is no tax assessment (in addition to the normal,
annual general real estate tax assessment) pending with respect to the Owned
Real Property or, to Sellers Knowledge, the Leased Premises, or, to Sellers
Knowledge, threatened, with respect to any portion of the Owned Real Property
or the Leased Premises.

(c) _Intellectual Property_.

 

(i) Disclosure Schedule 4.3(c) lists: (1) each Registered item of Acquired
Intellectual Property that is owned by any Seller and indicates for each such
Registered item (A) the name of the owner thereof; (B) the registration or
application number; (C) the applicable filing jurisdiction (or, for domain
names, the applicable registrar); and (D) the date of filing or issuance, and
(2) each license in the Acquired Intellectual Property under which any Seller
is a licensee or licensor of Intellectual Property (other than licenses to use
software for personal computer operating systems that were provided when the
computers were purchased and licenses to use software for personal computers
that are granted to retail purchasers of such software). There is no
litigation, opposition, cancellation, proceeding, objection or claim
pending, asserted or threatened in writing concerning the ownership,
validity, registerability, enforceability, infringement, use or licensed right
to use any Acquired Intellectual Property.

 

(ii) To the Knowledge of each Seller, the conduct of the Business and the
Products sold and services provided by any Seller or any of its Affiliates in
connection therewith, has not, does not, and immediately following the
Closing, will not, infringe, constitute the misappropriation of or otherwise
violate any Intellectual Property of any Person. To the Knowledge of each
Seller, none of the Acquired Intellectual Property is being infringed upon,
misappropriated or otherwise violated by any other Person.

(iii) There are no pending, or to the Knowledge of each Seller, threatened,
proceedings, administrative claims, litigation or adverse claims alleging that
the conduct of the Business or the Products sold and services provided by any
Seller or any of its Affiliates infringes, misappropriates or otherwise
violates the Intellectual Property of any Person.

 



-45- (iv) The Acquired Intellectual Property constitutes all Intellectual Property
that is used in the Business and, immediately after the Closing, necessary
for Buyers to conduct and operate the Business as now being conducted by
Sellers and their Affiliates. One of the Sellers or its respective Affiliates
(A) owns, solely and exclusively, all rights, title and interest
(beneficially and of record where applicable) in and to the Owned Intellectual
Property, free and clear of all Liens, and such Owned Intellectual Property
is, to the Knowledge of each Seller, valid, subsisting and enforceable, and
is not subject to any outstanding order, judgment, decree or agreement
adversely affecting any Sellers or any Sellers Affiliates use thereof or
rights thereto, or (B) has the right to use, pursuant to valid license, (1)
the Acquired Intellectual Property, as such Intellectual Property is currently
used in the Business, and (2) the software used by such Seller or Affiliate.

 

(v) Immediately after the Closing, Buyers will own or have the right to use in
the operation of the Business all of the Acquired Intellectual Property, on
terms and conditions the same, in all material respects, as those in effect
immediately prior to the Closing.

(vi) Each Seller and each of its Affiliates have properly executed and
recorded all documents necessary to perfect its title to each item of Owned
Intellectual Property that is Registered, and has filed all documents and paid
all fees, and other financial obligations required to maintain in full force
and effect all such items until the Closing.

(vii) Each Seller and its Affiliates have taken all reasonable measures to
protect the secrecy, confidentiality and value of all Trade Secrets that are
either (A) owned by any Seller and Related to the Business or (B) owned by a
third party where any Seller or its respective Affiliates have an obligation
to maintain such Trade Secret(s) in confidence, and to each Sellers
Knowledge, the Trade Secrets included in (A) above have not been used,
disclosed to or discovered by any person or entity except pursuant to valid
and appropriate non-disclosure and/or license agreements, which, to Sellers
Knowledge, have not been breached. To each Sellers Knowledge, no Active
Employee has any patents issued or applications pending for any device,
process, design or invention of any kind now used or needed by any Seller or
its Affiliates in the furtherance of the Business that have not been assigned
to any such Seller and/or its Affiliates.

 

(viii) To each Sellers Knowledge, no Active Employees performance of his or
her employment activities violates the Intellectual Property or other rights
of any person or entity.

(ix) The IT Assets operate and perform, in all material respects, in
accordance with their documentation and functional specifications and
otherwise as required in connection with the Business, and have not materially
malfunctioned or failed within the past three years. To each Sellers
Knowledge, the IT Assets do not contain any "time bombs," "Trojan horses,"
"back doors," "trap doors," "worms," viruses, bugs, faults or other devices or
effects that (A) enable or assist any Person to access without authorization
the IT Assets, or (B) otherwise significantly adversely affect the
functionality of the IT Assets. A Seller or one of

 



-46-  its Affiliates takes and has taken reasonable measures to protect the
confidentiality, integrity and security of the IT Assets, and all information
stored or contained therein or thereon or transmitted thereby from any
unauthorized use, access, interruption or modification by third parties. To
each Sellers Knowledge, no Person has gained unauthorized access to the IT
Assets. Each Seller has implemented reasonable backup and disaster recover
technology consistent with industry practices.

(d) _Contracts_.

 

(i) All of the Contracts are in full force and effect, and constitute valid
and binding obligations of any Seller(s) party thereto and, to Sellers
Knowledge, each other party thereto. Each Seller and/or each of its Affiliates
has fulfilled and performed in all material respects its obligations under
each Contract that it is party thereto (to the extent performance has
been required of any such party), and neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates are in, or to such Sellers Knowledge, are alleged to be in, any
material breach or material default under any Contract. To Sellers Knowledge,
no party to any of the Contracts is in violation of or default under any of
the Contracts such that the violation or default is likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. No event, occurrence or condition exists under any
Contract which, with the lapse of time, the giving of notice, or both, or the
happening of any further event or condition, would constitute a violation,
breach or event of default by any Seller or, to Sellers Knowledge, any other
party thereto, except for such violations, breaches or events that would not
have a Material Adverse Effect. No disputes or disagreements are outstanding
with respect to any Contract, and none are threatened to any Sellers
Knowledge. No Seller has released any rights under any Contract, and
to Sellers Knowledge, there are no outstanding powers of attorney in favor
of any Person relating to the Business that would affect any Acquired Asset.
No Seller is subject to any legal obligations to renegotiate, nor is there any
right to renegotiate, any Material Contract, except as may be set forth in
the Material Contracts.

(ii) The Contracts (including the Material Contracts), together with the
Assigned Leases and the Replacement Leases, constitute all of the agreements
reasonably necessary for the conduct of the Business in the manner and to the
extent currently conducted.

 

(iii) Sellers have delivered or made available to Buyers true and complete
copies of each Material Contract, including all amendments thereto and
accurate written descriptions of all material terms of all oral Contracts.

amendments or waivers exist to or under any Contract.

Owner is subject and that relates to or may adversely affect the Business, the
Acquired Assets, this Agreement, any Related Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein and therein.

 

(d) _No Assumption of Liabilities_. Neither the execution of this Agreement or

Business or (B) to assign to any Seller or to any other Person any rights to
any invention, improvement, or discovery. No former or current employee of

respects.

(iii) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened claims
by any Person covered thereby (other than ordinary claims for benefits

neither any Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate has any obligation under any

however designated, for failure to comply with any of the foregoing Legal

(h) _Legal Requirements_.

 

(i) _Compliance with Laws_. Except as disclosed on Disclosure Schedule
4.5(h)(i), (A) the Business, since January 1, 2012 has, and currently is,

Legal Requirements and (B) neither any Seller nor any Affiliates of any Seller
has received any notice from a Governmental Authority or any other Person,
alleging any material violation under any applicable Legal Requirement.

necessary to, and the Acquired Assets include all of the Governmental
Authorizations necessary to, conduct the

conducted, except for Governmental Authorizations, (A) the absence of which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect,
and (B) containing a notation on Disclosure Schedule 4.5(h)(ii)(2), which
indicates each such Governmental Authorization shall not be transferred or
assigned to Buyers on or before the Closing Date. Disclosure Schedule
4.5(h)(ii)(2) sets forth a true, correct and complete list of Governmental
Authorizations used in, or required for the operation of, the Business.

 

To the Knowledge of Sellers, all Governmental Authorizations of the Business
are in full force and effect. There does not exist under any Governmental
Authorization of the Business any default or violation, or event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a material default or
violation or would result in the withdrawal of such Governmental
Authorization, nor to Sellers Knowledge is there any basis for assertion of
any default or violation. To Sellers Knowledge, there has been no material
change in the facts or circumstances reported or assumed in the application
for or granting of any Governmental Authorization. No Proceeding is pending
or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened, to suspend, revoke, withdraw, modify or
limit any material Governmental Authorization, and, to Sellers Knowledge,
there is no fact, error or admission relevant to any material Governmental
Authorization that would permit the suspension, revocation, withdrawal,
modification or limitation of, or result in the threatened suspension,
revocation, withdrawal, modification or limitation of, or in the loss of any
material Governmental Authorization. Sellers have delivered to Buyers true and
complete copies of all of the Governmental Authorizations of the Business,
including any amendments thereto.

 

(iii) _Certain Acts_. Neither any Seller or its Affiliates nor, to the
Knowledge of each Seller, any of their respective former or current officers,
partners, employees, agents or representatives has made or agreed to make,
directly or indirectly, with respect to the Business or assets of each such
Seller, any (A) bribes or kickbacks, illegal political
contributions, payments from company funds not recorded on the books and
records of such Seller, or funds to governmental officials (or any such
officials family members or affiliates) for the purpose of affecting their
action or the action of the government they represent, to obtain favorable
treatment in securing business or licenses or to obtain special concessions,
or made or agreed to make illegal payments from company funds to obtain or
retain business or (B) payments from company funds to governmental officials
for the purpose of affecting their action or the action of the government they
represent, to obtain favorable treatment in securing business or licenses or

the foregoing, none of the foregoing Persons has made or agreed to make,
directly or indirectly, (whether or not said payment is lawful) any payment to
obtain, or with respect to, sales other than usual and regular compensation to
its employees and sales representatives with respect to such sales. Sellers,
their Affiliates, and, to the Knowledge of each Seller, their respective
former or current officers, partners, employees, agents or representatives
have conducted the Business in compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices

reasonable efforts to assist Buyers in timely effecting all necessary
Environmental Permit transfers.

or (C) against any real or personal property or operations currently or, to
any Sellers Knowledge, formerly owned, leased, operated or managed, in whole
or in part, by any Seller. To each Sellers Knowledge, there are no
circumstances reasonably forming the basis for the assertion of any presently
unasserted Environmental Claims.

 

(iv) _Environmental Releases_. There have been no Environmental Releases of
any Hazardous Materials that were caused by the acts or omissions of any
Seller or by any other Person from or at the Leased Premises or any other
location that would be likely to reasonably form the basis of any material
Environmental Claim against any Seller or the Business or against any other
Person whose liability for any Environmental Claim any Seller has or may have
retained or assumed either contractually or by operation of law.

 

(v) _Underground Storage Tanks_. Disclosure Schedule 4.5(i)(v) lists all
underground storage tanks currently or formerly located on the Owned Real
Property or, to any Sellers Knowledge, the Leased Premises, or otherwise
owned or operated by any Seller, and the current regulatory status of each
such tank.

decree, injunction or other agreement with any Governmental Authority or any
indemnity or other agreement with any third party relating to liability under
any Environmental Law.

(vii)  _Environmental Assessments_. Sellers have provided Buyers with copies
of or notices of and an opportunity to review all reports, assessments,
studies and analyses in their possession relating to any potential
Environmental Conditions of any real property or operations currently or
formerly owned, leased, operated or managed, in whole or in part, by any
Seller, and documents pertaining to any non-compliances with Environmental
Laws relating to Sellers.

 

(viii) _Environmental Disclosure_. Disclosure Schedule 4.5(i)(viii) sets
forth: (A) known material environmental liabilities of each Seller, (B) any
written notices of any violation of, or any liability under, any Environmental
Laws (including common law) and (C) all formerly owned properties that have

-57- (j) _Territorial Restrictions_. Except as disclosed on Disclosure Schedule
4.5(j), neither any Seller nor any Owner is restricted by any agreement or
understanding with any Person from carrying on the Business anywhere in the
world or from expanding the Business in any way or entering into any
new businesses, including any Contract that impairs the ability to freely
conduct the Business in the Ordinary Course of Business, except for such
restrictions that, individually or in the aggregate, would not be material to
the Business and that would not apply to the Business or Buyers following the
Closing.

(k) _Operation of the Business_. No part of the Business is
currently operated by Sellers through any entity other than Sellers.

4.6 _Solvency_. No Seller is insolvent, and no Seller will be
rendered insolvent by the occurrence of the transactions contemplated by this

contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements, (a) each Seller
will be able to pay its liabilities as they become due, (b) no Seller will
have unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the Business as
presently conducted, (c) each Seller will have assets (calculated at fair
market value) that exceed its liabilities and (d) to Sellers Knowledge,
taking into account all pending and threatened litigation, final judgments
against any Seller in actions for money damages are not reasonably
anticipated to be rendered at a time when, or in amounts such that, each such
Seller will be unable to satisfy any such judgments promptly in accordance
with their terms (taking into account the maximum probable amount of such
judgments in any such actions and the earliest reasonable time at which such
judgments might be rendered) as well as all other obligations of such Seller.
The cash available to each Seller, after taking into account all other
anticipated uses of the cash, will be sufficient to pay all such debts and
judgments promptly in accordance with their terms. As used in this Section,
"insolvent" means that the sum of the present fair saleable value of each
Sellers assets does not and will not exceed its debts and other probable
liabilities.

4.7 _No Broker Fees; No Commissions_. All negotiations on behalf of Sellers
and Owners relative to this Agreement and the Related Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been carried on by Sellers
and/or Owners directly with Buyers, without any act by any Seller, any Owner
or any of their respective Affiliates that would give rise to any claim
against any Buyer for a brokerage commission, finders fee or other similar
payment.

 

4.8 _Competition Act (Canada)_. Calculated in accordance with the requirements
of the Competition Act (Canada), the total book value of the Acquired Assets
in Canada does not exceed CAN$82,000,000.00 and the annual gross revenues in
or from Canada generated by the Acquired Assets in Canada do not exceed

4.9 _Investment Canada Act_. Calculated in accordance with the requirements of
the Investment Canada Act, the total book value of the assets of Canadian
Pump does not exceed CAN$344,000,000.00.

(Canada), and made pursuant to this _Section 6.3_.

 

6.4 _Tax Matters_.

(a)  _Sellers  Liability for Taxes_. Sellers shall be jointly liable for (A)
any Taxes imposed with respect to the Business or any Acquired Assets or any
income or gain derived with respect thereto for the taxable periods, or
portions thereof, ended on or before the Closing Date, (B) Losses directly or
indirectly relating to or arising out of any liability for Taxes imposed with
respect to the Business or any Acquired Assets or any income or gain derived
with respect thereto for the taxable periods, or portions thereof, ended on
or before the Closing Date, and (C) any Transfer Taxes for which Sellers are
liable pursuant to _Section 6.4(c)_.

 

(b) _Buyers  Liability for Taxes_. Buyers shall be jointly liable for (A) any
Taxes imposed with respect to the Business or any Acquired Assets or any
income or gains derived with respect thereto for any taxable period, or
portion thereof, beginning after the Closing Date, (B) Losses directly or
indirectly relating to or arising out of any liability for Taxes imposed with
respect to the Business or any Acquired Assets or any income or gains derived
with respect thereto for any taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning
after the Closing Date, and (C) any Transfer Taxes for which Buyers are
liable pursuant to _Section 6.4(c)_.

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. Sellers, jointly, and Buyers, jointly, shall each bear
responsibility for one-half (1/2) of the Transfer Taxes; _provided_ , that
Buyers shall be jointly liable for all Transfer Taxes that would not have been
imposed on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement but for any
assignment, transfer, sale, or other disposition of any of the Acquired
Assets by the Buyers (including to or by their Affiliates) after the Closing,
including pursuant to _Section 2.15_; provided further, Buyer shall be solely
responsible for GST. Any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with
Transfer Taxes shall be prepared by the party primarily or customarily
responsible under applicable local Legal Requirements for filing such Tax
Returns, and such party will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to provide such Tax Returns to the other party at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the date such Tax Returns are due to be filed. Buyers and
Sellers shall cooperate in the timely completion and filing of all such Tax
Returns. Sellers and Buyers shall promptly pay all Transfer Taxes. Any
Transfer Taxes resulting from any subsequent increase in the Initial
Consideration for the Acquired Assets shall be borne in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 6.4(c)_. Prior to, or in no event later than
Closing, Buyers and Sellers shall provide to the other copies of any
applicable exemption certificates, including sale for resale exemption
certificates, necessary to establish the right to 

 



-64-  any exemption from Transfer Taxes (" _Exemption Certificates_ "). Buyers and
Sellers shall thereafter provide the other with any additional Exemption
Certificates and other documentation as may be required by the Governmental
Authorities for such purpose. Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with Buyers,
including providing Buyers with reasonable access to Sellers books, records,
and such other data as Buyers may reasonably request in order to support all
applicable exemptions from Transfer Taxes.

(d) _Proration of Taxes_. To the extent necessary to determine the liability
for real property, personal property, ad valorem and similar Taxes ("
_Property Taxes_ ") for a portion of a taxable year or period that begins
before and ends after the Closing Date, such Property Taxes relating to the
Acquired Assets (and any tax refunds relating to such Property Taxes) shall be
prorated between such Seller and Buyers as of the Closing Date based upon
actual amounts paid or payable as evidenced by appropriate invoices from the
applicable Governmental Authorities or, if actual amounts of Property Tax are
not known, then estimates of the amount of such Property Taxes and assessments
that are due and payable with respect to the Acquired Assets during the year
during which the Closing Date occurs. With respect to pro rata
determinations, Property Taxes and assessments payable (and any Property Tax
refunds relating to such Property Taxes and assessments payable) shall be
allocable, based upon the Closing Date, over the taxable year with respect to
which the Property Tax is paid. If such Seller and Buyers estimate any such
actual amount of such Property Tax assessments, then as soon as practicable
after the actual amount of such Property Taxes and assessments is known, such
Seller and Buyers shall determine if there is any amount owed either by such
Seller to Buyers or vice versa based on such Sellers being liable for those
Property Taxes and assessments attributable to the time period up to and
including the Closing Date, and Buyers being liable for those Property Taxes
and assessments attributable to the post-Closing Date period. Any such
liability by each such Seller to Buyers or vice versa shall be paid promptly
following the delivery of a calculation of such liability by either party to
the other party.

(e) _Contest Provisions_. Each Buyer, on the one hand, and each Seller, on
the other hand, shall promptly notify the other in writing upon receipt of
notice of any pending or threatened audits or assessments with respect to
Taxes for which such other party (or such other partys Affiliates) may be
liable hereunder. Each such Seller shall be entitled to participate at its
expense in the defense of and, at its option, take control of the complete
defense of, any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to
Taxes for which it may be liable, and to employ counsel of its choice at its
expense. No party may agree to settle any claim for Taxes for which any other
party may be liable without the prior written consent of such other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned, or withheld.

(f) _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, the parties
shall cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with
Governmental Authorities regarding, any Tax Returns and payments in respect
thereof. Each party shall (i) provide timely notice to the other in writing of
any pending or proposed audits or assessments with respect to Taxes for which
any other party or any of its Affiliates may have a liability under this
Agreement and (ii) furnish the other with copies of all relevant
correspondence received from any Governmental Authority in connection with
any audit or information request with respect to any Taxes referred to in
clause (i).

 



-65- (g) _Additional Canadian Tax Matters_. URC or one of its Affiliates and
Canadian Pump shall make the joint election in prescribed form pursuant to
Section 167 of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) such that no GST is payable by URC
or its Affiliates in respect of the purchase of the Acquired Assets.

 

 __(h) _Employee Withholding and Reporting Matters_. With respect to those
Transition Employees who are employed by Buyers within the same calendar year
as the Closing, Buyers shall, in accordance with and to the extent permitted
pursuant to Revenue Procedure 2004-53, assume all responsibility for preparing
and filing each Form W-2, _Wage and Tax Statement_ , Form W-3, _Transmittal of

6.5  _Post-Closing Obligations Regarding Employees and Employee Benefits_.

(a) _Employment of Active Employees by Buyers_.

 

(i) Buyers are not obligated to hire any Active Employee but may interview
certain Active Employees. Prior to the Closing Date, Buyers shall provide
Sellers with a list of Active Employees to whom Buyers intend to make an offer
of employment (the " _Transition Employees_ "). Subject to Legal Requirements,
each Seller hereby grants Buyers access to the personnel records (including
performance appraisals, disciplinary actions and grievances) of such Seller
for the purpose of administering the employment of the Transition Employees.
Access will be provided by each such Seller during normal business hours
upon reasonable prior notice. If requested by Buyers, each Seller will
terminate the employment of all of its Transition Employees as of Closing. The
employment offers provided by Buyers shall provide for employment of each
Transition Employee with either Buyer or either Buyers Affiliates effective
as of immediately after the Closing.

(ii) It is understood and agreed that (A) Buyers extension of offers of
employment as set forth in this _Section 6.5(a)_ shall not constitute any
commitment, contract or understanding (expressed or implied) of any obligation
on the part of Buyers to a post-Closing employment relationship of any fixed
term or duration or upon any terms or conditions other than those that Buyers
may establish pursuant to individual offers of employment, and (B) employment
offered by Buyers is "at will" and may be terminated by Buyers or by an
employee at any time for any reason (subject to any written commitments to the
contrary made by Buyers or an employee and any Legal Requirements). Nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed to prevent or restrict in any way the right of
Buyers to terminate, reassign, promote or demote any of the Transition
Employees or to change adversely or favorably the title, powers, duties,
responsibilities, functions, locations, salaries, other compensation or terms
or conditions of employment of such employees.

(iii) In addition to and notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) without the
express written consent or request of Buyers, no Seller shall (1) enforce any
obligations of any Transition Employees to any Seller pursuant to any non-
competition agreement, inventions assignment agreement or any other type of
agreement Related to the Business each such Seller

 



-66-  may have with the Transition Employees or (2) assign any such obligations to
any Person other than Buyers, and (B) each Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts, at Buyers expense, to enforce its rights against (1) any
Active Employee who is not hired by Buyer and (2) any Transition Employee at
Buyers request pursuant to any non-competition agreement, inventions
assignment or any other type of agreement any Seller may have with the Active
Employees who are not hired by Buyers.

(iv) No Seller or its Affiliates shall engage in any activity intended to
discourage any Transition Employee from accepting an offer of employment from
Buyers; _provided_ , _however_ , that each Seller and its Affiliates shall be
permitted to take any action they are legally required to take in order to
comply with local employment-related Legal Requirements.

(v) Sellers shall be responsible for providing or discharging any and all
notifications, benefits and liabilities to Active Employees and governmental
authorities required by the WARN Act or by any other applicable Legal
Requirements relating to plant closings, mass layoffs or employee
separations or severance pay that are required to be provided on or before
the Closing as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and Buyers shall be responsible for any and all such matters following the
Closing. Sellers shall cooperate in providing information related to
employment with the Business reasonably requested by Buyers in connection with
any notices that Buyers may desire to provide prior to the Closing in
connection with actions by Buyers after the Closing that would result in a
notice requirement under such Legal Requirements.

(b) _Salaries and Welfare Benefits_.

 

(i) Each Seller shall be responsible for: (A) the payment of all wages and
other remuneration due to Active Employees with respect to their services as
employees of such Seller through the Closing Date, including pro rata bonus
payments, all commission payments, all vacation pay earned through the Closing
Date and all earned and unused sick days and other paid leave earned
through the Closing Date; and (B) the payment of any termination or severance
payments and the provision of health plan continuation coverage in accordance
with the requirements of Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA.

 

(ii) Buyers and Sellers acknowledge and agree that neither Buyer shall be
liable for any claims made or incurred by Active Employees and
their beneficiaries under the Benefit Plans of such Seller.

(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
Seller acknowledges and agrees that Buyers shall have no obligation to
provide continuation coverage under COBRA (or any state health care
continuation coverage law) with respect to any individual who either prior to,
on or after the Closing Date was covered under any group health plan
contributed to or maintained by such Seller or any ERISA Affiliate, and that
such Seller shall be solely responsible for compliance with all such
continuation coverage requirements with respect to such individuals in
connection with such group health plan(s); _provided_ , _however_ , that
Buyers and their Affiliates shall be responsible for compliance with such
continuation coverage requirements with respect to such individuals who become
employed by either Buyer or an

 



-67-  Affiliate thereof. Each Seller shall ensure that Buyers have no obligation
to give any notices required by COBRA and any other applicable law or to make
continuation coverage available in connection with the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement to those individuals covered under any group
health plan contributed to or maintained by such Seller and who become
"qualified beneficiaries" within the meaning of Section 4980B(g)(1) of the
Code or any analogous applicable state law.

each of which rights and remedies shall be independent of the others and
severally enforceable, and each of which is in addition to, and not in lieu
of, any other rights and remedies available to Buyers at law or in equity:

(i) _Specific Performance_. For the avoidance of doubt, the right and remedy
to have the Restrictive Covenants specifically enforced by any court of
competent jurisdiction, it being agreed that any breach or threatened breach
of the Restrictive Covenants would cause irreparable injury to Buyers and that
money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to Buyers. Accordingly, in
addition to any other rights or remedies, Buyers shall be entitled to
equitable and injunctive relief, including by temporary restraining order, 

 



-74-  temporary injunction, permanent injunction or otherwise, without posting a
bond, to enforce the terms of the Restrictive Covenants and to restrain any
Seller, any Owner or any of their respective Affiliates from any violation

account for and pay over to Buyers all compensation, profits, monies,
accruals, increments or other benefits derived or received by each such Seller

(iii) _Severability of Covenants_. Each Seller and each Owner acknowledges and
agrees that the Restrictive Covenants are reasonable and valid in
geographical and temporal scope and in all other respects. If any court
determines that any portion of the Restrictive Covenants is invalid, the
remaining portions shall not thereby be affected and shall be given full
effect, without regard to the invalid portion. If any court of competent
jurisdiction determines that any of the Restrictive Covenants, or any part
thereof, is unenforceable because of the duration, geographic scope or other
limitation of such provision, such court shall reduce the duration or scope
of such provision, or otherwise revise such provision, as the case may be, to
the extent necessary to render it enforceable and, in its reduced form, such
provision shall then be enforced.

 

(iv) _Enforceability in Jurisdiction_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, each Buyer, each Seller and each Owner intends to and hereby
confers jurisdiction to enforce the Restrictive Covenants upon the courts of
any jurisdiction within the geographic scope of the Restrictive Covenants. If
the courts of any one or more of such jurisdictions hold the
Restrictive Covenants unenforceable by reason of the breadth of such scope or
otherwise, it is the intention of each Buyer, each Seller and each Owner that
such determination not bar or in any way affect Buyers right to the relief
provided above in the courts of any other jurisdiction within the geographic
scope of the Restrictive Covenants as to breaches of such covenants in such
other respective jurisdictions, such covenants as they relate to each
jurisdiction being, for this purpose, severable into diverse and independent
covenants.

(f) _Tolling_. If any Seller or any Owner or any of their Affiliates violates
any of the restrictions contained in this _Section 6.9_, the Restricted
Period will be suspended and will not run in favor of the breaching Seller or
Owner, as the case may be, until such time that such Seller or Owner cures
the violation to the satisfaction of Buyers, at which point such suspension
will be lifted.

make a joint election under paragraph 56.4(7)(g) of the Income Tax Act
(Canada).

6.13(a)_ in the event of any breach of such Section in addition to any rights
it may have for damages, which shall include out of pocket expenses, loss of

pending or threatened claim by a third party that the Indemnified Party has

indemnification under this Agreement) to indemnification under this _Article
8_; _provided_ , that in the event that any Seller or any Owner is an
Indemnifying Party, such notice shall be given to the Seller Representative.
The failure to provide notice will not affect any rights under this

Indemnifying Party. Any notices and communications under this _Article 8_
will be given to or made in accordance with  _Section 10.4_. The parties
agree that notices for claims in respect of a breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement must be delivered prior to the expiration of

such applicable date, an Indemnified Party shall have notified the
Indemnifying Party in accordance with this _Section 8.4_ of a claim for
indemnification under this _Article 8_ (whether or not formal legal action
shall have been commenced based upon such claim), such claim shall continue to
be subject to indemnification in accordance with this  _Article 8_
notwithstanding the passing of such applicable date, until such claim is
resolved.

8.5 _Limitations on Indemnity_.

(a) _Minimum Indemnity_. No Indemnifying Party shall have any liability to
Buyer Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees, as applicable, for indemnifiable
Losses under _Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.3(a)_, as applicable, until such
Losses (together with other Losses of Buyer Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees,
as applicable) exceed an aggregate amount equal to the Minimum Threshold, in
which case the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees, as applicable, for the total amount of all
indemnifiable Losses. No Loss may be claimed under  _Section 8.2(a)_ or
_Section 8.3(a)_, as the case may be, by

 



-86-  an Indemnified Party or included in calculating the Minimum Threshold unless
it exceeds, individually or together with all Losses resulting from the same
or series of related claims arising out of the same facts, events or
circumstances, $50,000.00.

(b) _Maximum Indemnity_. Neither any Seller nor any Owner shall be
required to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees for Losses under _Section 8.2(a)_ in
an aggregate amount greater than the Cap. Neither Buyer shall be required to
indemnify Seller Indemnitees for Losses under _Section 8.3(a)_ in an
aggregate amount greater than the Cap.

(c) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section 8.2_ or _Section
8.3_ in respect of any indemnifiable Loss shall be limited to the amount of
any liability or damage that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance
proceeds, net of any actual costs, expenses or premiums incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with securing or obtaining such proceeds,
including any proceeds transferred to an Indemnifying Party under _Section
6.17_, and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually
received by the Indemnified Party in respect of any such claim, in each case
except to the extent that the deduction itself would excuse, exclude or limit
the coverage of all or part of such Loss (it being agreed that neither party
shall have any obligation to seek to recover any insurance proceeds in
connection with making a claim under this _Article 8_ and that, promptly after
the realization of any insurance proceeds, indemnity, contribution or other
similar payment, the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying
Party for such reduction in Losses for which the Indemnified Party was
indemnified prior to the realization of reduction of such Losses).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of the limitations
on indemnification set forth in this _Section 8.5_ shall apply to: (i) any
Loss that any Buyer Indemnitee incurs or to which any Buyer Indemnitee
becomes subject, whether in respect of Third Party Claims, claims between the
parties hereto, or otherwise, directly or indirectly arising out of, relating
to, or in connection with (including, without limitation, future costs and
expenses to the extent reasonably expected to be incurred in connection with
any Loss reasonably calculable at the time of such indemnity claim) (A) any
Breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty in the Fundamental
Representations; or (B) any Breach or non-fulfillment of the covenants and
agreements set forth in _Section 6.6(e)_; and (ii) _Sections 8.2(a)(iii)_,
_8.2(a)(iv)_ , _8.2(a)(v)_ , _8.2(a)(vii)_ and _8.2(a)(viii)_ ; _provided_ ,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Sellers and Owners,
be liable, collectively, for Losses to any Buyer Indemnitees in excess of the
Aggregate Cap (other than for Losses arising out of, relating to or in
connection with any Retained Liability or any Breach or non-fulfillment of
the covenants and agreements set forth in _Section 6.6(e)_, neither of which,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall be subject to any limitations set forth in
this _Article 8_ ).

 

8.6 _Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) In the event an Indemnified Party receives notice of any action, audit,
claim, demand or assessment (each, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against the
Indemnified Party which may give rise to a claim for Loss under this _Article
8_, within ten (10) Business Days from its receipt of such notice (the "
_Notice Period_ "), the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party
notice of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delay of
any Indemnified Party in giving notice of any such Third Party Claim shall not
affect such Indemnified Partys 

 



-87-  rights under this _Article 8_ except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall
be entitled, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirement, to be
represented by counsel approved by the Indemnified Party (which approval may
not be unreasonably withheld) to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim
if it (i) promptly notifies the Indemnified Party in writing within the
Notice Period whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim and (ii) has expressly agreed in writing that, as
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying
Party shall be solely obligated to satisfy and discharge such Third Party
Claim and that the claims made in such Third Party Claim are within the scope
of and subject to indemnification by the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with the terms hereof.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) the Indemnified Party shall have
reasonably concluded that there is a reasonable probability that the Third
Party Claim may materially and adversely affect it or its Affiliates other
than as a result of monetary damages for which the Indemnified Party would be
entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under this  _Article 8_, (ii)
the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, such Third Party Claim
include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, and the
Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal
defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party, or (iii) Seller Representative is subject
to bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership proceedings, then, in any such case,
the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume or control such
defense. If the Indemnified Party duly elects to undertake a defense against a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may do so at its sole cost and
expense, _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the
Indemnified Party for the reasonable fees of such separate counsel if the
actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, such Third Party Claim
include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, and the
Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal
defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party agree to make available to each other, their counsel
and other representatives, all information and documents available to them
which relate to such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party also agree to render to each other such assistance and
cooperation as may reasonably be required to ensure the proper and adequate
defense of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall obtain the
prior written approval of the Indemnified Party (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld) before entering into any settlement, compromise or
discharge of such Third Party Claim, or if the defense of such Third Party
Claim has been assumed by the Indemnified Party, ceasing to defend
against such Third Party Claim unless (1) as a result of such settlement or
ceasing to defend, no injunctive or other equitable relief would be imposed
against the Indemnified Party and no finding or admission of any violation of
applicable Legal Requirement or violation of the rights of any Person is made
against any Indemnified Party and, in the event of ceasing to defend, the
Indemnifying Party has paid to the Indemnified Party an amount equal to the
amount sought from the Indemnified Party pursuant to such Third Party Claim,
or (2) in the case of a settlement, the Indemnified Party receives from the
claimant an unconditional release from all further liability in respect of
such Third Party Claim in a written agreement in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall provide
the Indemnified Party with prompt written notice of any such settlement
(together with a copy thereof) or ceasing to defend. If the Indemnifying Party
does not undertake within the Notice Period to defend against such Third
Party Claim or after assuming such control fails

 



-88-  to diligently defend against such Third Party Claim in good faith, then the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to take over the defense of such claim
and settle the Third Party Claim in such manner as it may deem appropriate,
and the Indemnifying Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnified Party
therefor. Except when the Indemnifying Party fails to diligently defend, the
Indemnified Party shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of such Third
Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Party consents in writing to such payment
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) or unless a judgment from
which no appeal may be taken by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party
is entered against the Indemnified Party for such Third Party Claim. With
respect to each Third Party Claim, each party hereby consents to the non-
exclusive jurisdiction of any court in which a Third Party Claim is brought
for purposes of any claim for indemnification with respect to such Third
Party Claim or the matters alleged therein, and agrees that process may be
served on such party with respect to any such claim anywhere in the world.

 

(c) Solely for purposes of this _Section 8.6_, in the event that any Seller
or any Owner is an Indemnifying Party, the Seller Representative shall have
all the rights and obligations of such Indemnifying Party, and all notices
required by this _Article 8_ shall be provided to the Seller Representative.

 

(d) _Cooperation_. The parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other to
implement the provisions of this _Section 8.6_. 

8.7 _Delays or Omissions, Waivers, Etc._ Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, including _Section 8.1(c)_ and  _Section 8.6(a)_, no delay or
omission to exercise any right, power or remedy inuring to any party upon any
breach or default of any party under this Agreement or any Related Agreement
shall impair any such right, power or remedy of such party nor shall it be
construed to be a waiver of any such breach or default, or an acquiescence
therein, or of or in any similar breach or default thereafter occurring; nor
shall any waiver of any single breach or default be deemed a waiver of
any other breach or default theretofore or thereafter occurring. Neither any
Sellers nor any Buyers right to indemnity pursuant to this _Article 8_ shall
be adversely affected by its waiver of a condition to Closing set forth in 
_Article 7_ unless such party makes clear by the terms of its waiver that it
is foreclosing its right to indemnity with respect to the matter that is the
subject of the waiver. Neither the exercise of nor the failure to exercise any
remedy under this Agreement or any Related Agreement will constitute an
election of remedies or limit in any manner enforcement of any remedies. All
remedies either under this Agreement or any Related Agreement or by law or
otherwise afforded to the parties shall be cumulative and not alternative.

8.8 _Payments_.

 

(a) If a Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification from Sellers or
Owners under this _Article 8_, then such Losses shall first be satisfied
from the Holdback Amount, including any interest or other amounts earned
thereon, and no amount shall be recovered by any Buyer pursuant to this
_Article 8_ unless and until the Holdback Amount has been exhausted or
released pursuant to _Section 2.11_.

(b) Subject to _Section 8.8(a)_, the Indemnifying Party shall pay all amounts
payable pursuant to this _Article 8_, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, promptly

 



-89-  following receipt from an Indemnified Party of a bill, together with all
accompanying reasonably detailed back-up documentation, for a Loss that is the
subject of indemnification hereunder, unless the Indemnifying Party in good
faith disputes the Loss, in which event it shall so notify the Indemnified
Party. In any event, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified
Party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the amount of any
Loss for which it is liable hereunder no later than three (3) days following
any final determination of such Loss and the Indemnifying Partys liability
therefor. A "final determination" shall exist when (i) the parties to the
dispute have reached an agreement in writing, (ii) a court of competent
jurisdiction shall have entered a final and non-appealable order or judgment,
or (iii) an arbitration or like panel shall have rendered a final non-
appealable determination with respect to disputes the parties have agreed to
submit thereto.

8.9 _Mitigation_. Each Indemnified Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any indemnifiable Loss.

8.10 _Remediation_. Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 8.5_
herein, with respect to any Environmental Condition for which any Seller is
required to indemnify and defend any Buyer pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement that requires any Remediation to respond to, remove or otherwise
address Environmental Conditions, the appropriate standard for Remediation
shall be to Commercial/Industrial standards, unless the lease for the affected
Leased Premises requires that more stringent standards be achieved, in which
case such standards shall apply.

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Sellers or Owners and such
breach, inaccuracy or failure cannot by cured by Seller Representative or
Owners, as the case may be, by the Outside Date, such that one or more of
the conditions to Closing set forth in _Sections 7.1_ or _7.2_ are not
capable of being fulfilled as of the Outside Date;

 



-90- (e) by Seller Representative (but only so long as each Seller and each Owner
is not in material breach of its respective obligations under this Agreement)

or agreement of Buyers and such breach, inaccuracy or failure cannot by cured
by Buyers by the Outside Date, such that one or more of the conditions to
Closing set forth in _Sections 7.1_ or _7.3_ are not capable of being
fulfilled as of the Outside Date; or

 

(f) by either Buyers or Seller Representative in the event that (i) there
shall be any Legal Requirement that makes consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibited; or (ii) any

Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1_, this Agreement shall thereafter
become void and have no effect, and no party hereto shall have any liability
to the other party hereto or their respective Affiliates, or their
respective directors, officers or employees, except for the obligations of
the parties hereto contained in this _Section 9.2_ and in _Sections 6.15_,
_10.1_ , _10.3_ , _10.4_ , _10.6_ , _10.7_ , _10.9_ , _10.11_  and _10.13_
(and any related definitional provisions contained herein), and except that
nothing in this _Section 9.2_ shall relieve any party from liability for any
breach of this Agreement that arose prior to such termination, for which
liability the provisions of _Article 8_ shall remain in effect in accordance
with the provisions and limitations of such Article.

 

ARTICLE 10

_MISCELLANEOUS _

10.1 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Selection of Forum; Attorneys
 Fees_. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RELATED AGREEMENTS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD
TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. Each party hereto agrees that it shall
bring any action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or
related to this Agreement, any Related Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein or therein exclusively in the Chosen Courts, and solely in
connection with claims arising under this Agreement, any Related Agreement or
the transactions contemplated herein or therein (i) irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to
laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii)
waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do
not have jurisdiction over any party hereto and (iv) agrees that service of
process upon such party in any such action or proceeding shall be effective if
notice is given in accordance with _Section 10.4_. Each party hereto
irrevocably designates CT Corporation as its agent and attorney-in-fact for
the acceptance of service of process and making an appearance on its behalf in
any such claim or proceeding and for the taking of all such acts as may be
necessary or appropriate in order to confer jurisdiction over it before the
Chosen Courts and each party hereto stipulates that such consent and
appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest.

 



-91- 10.2 _Successors and Assigns to this Agreement_. The provisions hereof shall
inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the permitted assigns,
successors, heirs, executors and administrators of the parties hereto. This
Agreement may not be assigned, voluntarily or involuntarily by operation of
law or otherwise, without the written consent of all other parties and any
attempted assignment without such consent shall be null and void; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that either Buyer may assign all of its rights hereunder to one of
its Affiliates and designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its
obligations hereunder (in all such cases the applicable Buyer shall
nonetheless remain responsible for the performance of its obligations
hereunder).

 

10.3 _Entire Agreement; Amendment_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure
Schedules and Exhibits hereto and the Related Agreements) constitute the
final agreement between the parties and the complete and exclusive expression
of the parties agreement on the matters contained herein. All prior and
contemporaneous negotiations, agreements, understandings, representations
and warranties, both written and oral, between the parties on the matters
contained herein are expressly merged into and superseded by this Agreement
(other than with respect to the rights and obligations set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement). This Agreement supersedes that certain letter of
intent dated December 10, 2013, between Parent and Sellers. In the event of
any inconsistency between the statements in the body of this Agreement and in
the Disclosure Schedules, Exhibits or any Related Agreement (other than an
exception expressly set forth as such in the Disclosure Schedules), the
statements in the body of this Agreement will control. Neither this Agreement
nor any term hereof may be amended, waived, discharged or terminated, except
by a written instrument signed by the parties hereto. For the avoidance of
doubt, the requirement to amend this Agreement in writing set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence may not be waived orally or by the conduct of
the parties.

10.4 _Notices, Etc._ All notices and other communications required or
permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be mailed by certified or
registered mail, postage prepaid with return receipt requested, telecopy or
electronic mail (with confirmation of transmission and with hard copy

addresses of the parties set forth below, or at such other address furnished
in writing to the other parties hereto.

10.5 _No Third Party Beneficiary, Etc._ This Agreement is for the sole benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective successor and permitted assigns,
and there shall be no third party beneficiary hereof. Neither the availability
of, nor any limit on, any remedy hereunder shall limit the remedies of any
party hereto against third parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer
Indemnitees and Seller Indemnitees are intended third party beneficiaries
under this Agreement and will be entitled to directly enforce any
indemnification rights to which they may be entitled under this Agreement.

10.6 _Reformation; Severability_. In case any provision hereof shall be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed to best
effectuate the intent of the parties and permit enforcement thereof, and the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby. If such provision is not capable of
reformation, it shall be severed from this Agreement and the enforceability of
the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

 

10.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any counterpart may be delivered
by facsimile or by electronic mail in Portable Document Format ( _.pdf_ );
_provided_ that attachment thereof shall constitute the representation
and warranty of the Person delivering such signature that such Person has
full power and authority to attach such signature and to deliver this
Agreement. Any facsimile signature shall be replaced with an original
signature as promptly as practicable. 

10.8 _Titles and Subtitles_. The titles of the paragraphs and subparagraphs
hereof are for convenience of reference only and are not to be considered in
construing this Agreement. References to "Sections" herein are references to
sections of this Agreement. The words "herein," "hereof," "hereto" and
"hereunder" and other words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular Article, Section or other subdivision.

10.9 _Expenses_. Except (i) as provided in _Section 2.10(c),_ _Section
2.12(g)_, _Section 6.3(c)_ and _Section 6.4(c)_, (ii) for (x) the Data Room
Expenses that are evidenced by one or more invoices received by Buyers prior
to the Closing Date and included in any adjustment to

 



-93-  the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.8(c)_ and (y) any cost and
expense related to obtaining certificates and/or other documents of title with
respect to any Acquired Asset pursuant to _Section 6.7(a)(ii)_, in each
case, of which one-half (1/2) shall be borne by Buyers and one-half (1/2)
shall be borne by Sellers, and (iii) as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, each party hereto will bear its respective costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the preparation, execution and performance of this
Agreement, the Related Agreements and the transactions contemplated herein or
therein, including without limitation all fees and expenses of agents,
representatives, counsel and accountants.

10.10 _Knowledge_. When reference is made to any Sellers or Sellers
"Knowledge", it means receipt of notice of such fact or matter by, or actual
knowledge of such fact or matter by, one or more of the following individuals:
Walter "Loddie" Naymola, Don S. Shaver, each U.S. Key Employee and each
Canadian Key Employee (collectively, the " _Knowledge Individuals_ "). No
representation or warranty made by any Seller or any Owner may be qualified or
limited by reference to the knowledge of any Seller or any Owner unless due
inquiry has actually been made by the Knowledge Individuals.

10.11 _Public Disclosure_. The parties acknowledge and agree that, except as
required for the pursuit of any Seller Consents required by _Section 6.8_ and
announcements to and discussions with employees of each Seller reasonably
required in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Related Agreements and the performance of the parties obligations
pursuant thereto, and except as otherwise required by any applicable Legal
Requirement, any press release or similar public announcement, communication
or disclosure of information concerning the execution or performance of this
Agreement or any Related Agreement shall be developed by Buyers or their
Affiliates and no Seller, Owner or Affiliate or Related Party of any Seller or
any Owner shall develop, make or issue any such press release, announcement,
communication or disclosure without the prior written consent of Buyers;
provided that Buyers shall deliver to Sellers a draft of any such press
release, announcement, communication or disclosure in advance of any
dissemination thereof and shall consider any reasonable comments and changes
timely submitted to Buyers by Sellers in relation thereto in good faith.

 

10.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

10.13 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the rights and remedies
of the parties hereto are cumulative. The transactions contemplated under
this Agreement are unique transactions and any failure on the part of any
party to complete the transactions contemplated under this Agreement on the
terms of this Agreement will not be fully compensable in damages and the
breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement would cause
the other parties irreparable harm.

 



-94- (b) In the event of any breach or threatened breach by any Seller or any
Owner, on the one hand, or any Buyer, on the other hand, as applicable, of
any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement,
any Seller or any Owner, on the one hand, or any Buyer, on the other hand, as
applicable, is entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other, as
applicable, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement for the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 10.13_ shall survive the
Closing and shall be available with respect to any breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement with respect to covenants and obligations required
to be performed under this Agreement.

 

10.14 _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Any obligation of any party to any other
party under this Agreement, or any of the Related Agreements, which
obligation is performed, satisfied or fulfilled completely by an Affiliate of
such party, shall be deemed to have been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by
such party.

 

10.15 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against the named
parties hereto (subject to the terms, conditions and other limitations set
forth herein). All claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise
out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement may be made only against the Persons that are
expressly identified as parties hereto, and no past, present or future
director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any party hereto
(including any person negotiating or executing this Agreement on behalf of a
party hereto) shall have any liability or obligation with respect to this
Agreement or with respect to any claim or cause of action that may arise out
of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance
of this Agreement.

10.16 _Relationship of the Parties_. Nothing herein shall be construed to
create a joint venture or partnership between the parties hereto or an
employee/employer relationship. The relationship of the parties is that of
independent contractors. Neither party hereto shall have any express or
implied right or authority to assume or create any obligations on behalf of
or in the name of the other party or to bind the other party to any contract,
agreement or undertaking with any third party.

 

10.17 _Seller Representative_.

 

(a) In order to administer efficiently the adjustments to the Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section 2.10_, the resolution of the Earnout Payment, the
termination provisions of this Agreement and the defense or settlement of any
claims for Losses for which the Sellers may be required to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnitees pursuant to this Agreement, Sellers and the Owners, by their
execution of this Agreement irrevocably appoint Mr. Don S. Shaver, or such
other person as later designated by the general partner of National Pump, as
their agent, attorney in fact and representative (with full power of
substitution) from and after the Closing (the " _Seller Representative_ "),
and, by its execution of this Agreement, Mr. Don S. Shaver, or such other
person as later designated by the general partner of National Pump hereby
accepts such appointment.

 



-95- (b) The Seller Representative is authorized (i) to take all action necessary
in connection with the acceptance, rejection, determination and payment of
any adjustment to the Purchase Price and the Earnout Payment pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, the termination of or the exercise of remedies under
this Agreement, and the defense or settlement of any claims for Losses
(including the power to compromise any indemnity claim on behalf of Sellers or
the Owners and to transact matters of litigation or arbitration) for which
Sellers and/or the Owners may be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees
pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) to give and receive all notices required to
be given under this Agreement to which any Seller is a party and (iii) to do
or refrain from doing all such further acts and things, and to execute all
such documents as the Seller Representative shall deem necessary or
appropriate in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the power:

 

(i) to execute and deliver all amendments, waivers, certificates and documents
that the Seller Representative deems necessary or appropriate in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including termination notices;

(ii) to receive funds, make payments of funds, and give receipts for funds;

(iii) to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of
the Sellers and/or Owners (or any subset thereof) that the Seller
Representative deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion relating
to the subject matter of this Agreement as fully and completely as Sellers
could do if personally present; and

(iv) to receive service of process in connection with any claims under this
Agreement.

 

(c) In the event that the Seller Representative becomes unable to perform the
Seller Representatives responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such
position, the general partner of National Pump shall select another
representative to fill such vacancy and such substituted representative shall
be deemed to be the Seller Representative for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

(d) All decisions and actions by the Seller Representative, including the
defense or settlement of any claims for Losses for which Sellers and/or the
Owners may be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to this
Agreement, shall be binding upon all Sellers and Owners, and no Seller or
Owner shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest
the same. 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
Buyer is entitled to rely exclusively upon any and all communications of the
Seller Representative under this Agreement as the communications of each
Seller and each Owner, as applicable. Each Buyer and the Buyer Indemnitees
shall be entitled to rely conclusively on any decision, act, consent
or instruction of the Seller Representative as to any adjustments of the
Purchase Price, resolution of the Earnout Payment, the termination of this
Agreement and the settlement of any claims for Losses for which Sellers or the
Owners may be required to 

 



-96-  indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to this Agreement and any other
actions required to be taken by the Seller Representative hereunder as being
the decision, act, consent or instruction of each Seller and each Owner, as
applicable. Each Buyer is relieved from any causes of action, lawsuits,
judgments, claims and demands of any Seller, any Owner or any Affiliate or
Related Party of any Seller or any Owner, or any other Person for any acts
taken in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Seller Representative. Each Buyer (i) need not be concerned with the authority
of the Seller Representative to act on behalf of Sellers and the Owners
and (ii) will not be held liable or accountable by any Seller or any Owner or
any other Person in any manner for any act or omission of, or any act or
omission of such Buyer in accordance with or in reliance upon any act or
omission of the Seller Representative.

(f) All actions, decisions and instructions of the Seller Representative shall
be conclusive and binding upon all Sellers and Owners, and no Seller or Owner
shall have any cause of action against the Seller Representative, and the
Seller Representative shall not be liable to any Seller or Owner for any
action taken or not taken, decision made or instruction given by the Seller
Representative under this Agreement, except for fraud, gross negligence or
willful misconduct by the Seller Representative. The Seller Representative
shall not be liable to any Seller for any apportionment or distribution of
payments made by it in good faith, and if any such apportionment or
distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error, the sole
recourse of any Seller to whom payment was due, but not made, shall be to
recover from other Sellers any payment in excess of the amount to which they
are determined to have been entitled pursuant to this Agreement. Neither the
Seller Representative nor any agent employed by it shall incur any liability
to any Seller by virtue of a failure or refusal of the Seller Representative
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or relating to the
performance of its other duties hereunder, except for actions or omissions
constituting fraud or bad faith.

 

(g) The provisions of this _Section 10.17_ are independent and severable, are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Seller or Owner may have in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(h) The provisions of this _Section 10.17_ shall be binding upon the legal
representatives, successors and permitted assigns of each Seller and each
Owner, and any references in this Agreement to Sellers or the Owners shall
mean and include the successors to the rights of Sellers or the Owners
hereunder.
