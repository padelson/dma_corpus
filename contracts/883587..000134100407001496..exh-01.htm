prior to the Effective Time, Buyer may elect instead to cause the Surviving
Corporation to deliver the Total Option Cash Payments and the Total Restricted
Stock Payments to the holders of shares of Company Options and Company

(b) As promptly as practicable following Effective Time and in any

of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (x) a letter of
transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall

lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and which shall be in
the form and have such other provisions as Buyer and the Company may
reasonably specify and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration
into which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented
by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall have been converted pursuant to
this Agreement, (ii) subject to Section 3.2(a), to each holder of a Company
Option, a check in an amount due and payable to such holder pursuant to
Section 3.3 hereof in respect of such Company Option, and (iii) subject to
Section 3.2(a), to each holder of a Restricted Stock Award, a check in an

thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together
with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be mailed promptly following the
Paying Agent\'s receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled.
If payment is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate of Book-Entry Share so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the person requesting such payment pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or such person shall establish to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or
is not applicable. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with
such reasonable

  



  

15

     

terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest
shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration (or the cash pursuant to Section
3.2(e)) payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or
in respect of Restricted Stock Awards or Company Options.

  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates, Book-Entry
Shares, Restricted Stock Awards or Company Options for nine (9) months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon
demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore
complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation, as general creditors thereof for payment of their claim for cash,
without interest thereon upon due surrender of their Certificates, Book-Entry
Shares, Restricted Stock Awards or Company Options.

  

(e) _No Liability_. None of Buyer, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any cash held in the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificates, Book-Entry Shares, Restricted Stock Awards or Company Options
shall not have been surrendered prior to one year after the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which any cash in respect of such
Certificate, Book-Entry Share, Restricted Stock Award or Company Option would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority),
any such cash in respect of such Certificate, Book-Entry Share, Restricted
Stock Award or Company Option shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Buyer, free and clear of all claims or interest of
any person previously entitled thereto.

  

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Buyer or, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that (i) no such
investment shall relieve Buyer or the Paying Agent from making the payments
required by this Article III, and following any losses that result in the
amount of cash included in the Exchange Fund to be insufficient to make the
remaining payments contemplated to be paid by the Paying Agent from the
Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 3.1(b), 3.3 and 3.4, Buyer shall promptly
provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of
Company Common Stock and, subject to Section 3.2(a), the Restricted Stock
Awards and Company Options, in the amount of such deficiency, and (ii) such
investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of America
with maturities of no more than thirty days or guaranteed by the United States
of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of

any action on the part of any holder of any Company Option, become fully
vested and converted into the right to receive, as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the Effective Time, a cash payment with respect

thereto equal to the product of (a) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option
_multiplied by_ (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such Company Option (the " _Option Cash Payment_ " and the sum of
all such payments, the " _Total Option Cash Payments_ "). As of the Effective
Time, all Company Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Option shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Option Cash Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any
and all actions necessary to effectuate this Section 3.3.

  

Section 3.4 _Restricted Stock Awards_. As of the Effective Time, each
then outstanding share of Company Common Stock which is subject to a
restricted Company Common Stock award granted under a Company Stock Plan
(each, a " _Restricted Stock Award_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder thereof, become fully vested and
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the "
_Restricted Stock Payment_ " and the sum of all such payments, the " _Total
Restricted Stock Payments_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such Restricted
Stock Awards shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder thereof shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any and all actions
necessary to effectuate this Section 3.4.

  

Section 3.5 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

  

Section 3.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, to the extent that holders of Company Common Stock are entitled
to appraisal rights under Section 262 of Delaware Law, shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
with respect to which the holder thereof has properly exercised his or her
demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of Delaware Law (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to
Section 262 of Delaware Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder
shall have failed to timely perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost his or her right to appraisal under Delaware Law, such holder\'s shares
of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of
the Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, and such shares shall no longer
be Dissenting Shares. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights
provided in Section 262 of Delaware Law and as provided in this Section 3.6.
The Company will give Buyer (i) prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisals of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and

  



  

17

     

received by the Company relating to stockholders\' rights of appraisal and
(ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such notices and demands. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Buyer, voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal or settle, or offer to agree to settle, any such
demands.

  

Section 3.7 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. After the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed, and
there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer following the Effective
Time, they shall be cancelled against delivery of the Merger Consideration, as
provided for in Section 3.1(b) hereof, for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificates.

  

Section 3.8 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation,
Buyer and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Company Common Stock, Company Options or Restricted Stock Awards
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Buyer or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Company Common Stock, Company Options or Restricted Stock Awards in respect
to which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation,
Buyer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

interests. All equity or voting interests (including partnership interests and
limited liability company interests) of the Company\'s subsidiaries held by

neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise,
whether or not required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance
sheet (or the notes thereto) of the Company and its subsidiaries, other than
those which would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

Section 4.11 _Absence of Litigation_. Except as set forth in Section

payable under the Company Benefit Plans) against or involving any Company
Benefit Plan or asserting any rights to or claims for benefits under any
Company Benefit Plan other than any such investigations, proceedings, or
claims that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

Benefit Plan for which financial statements are required by ERISA, there has
been no adverse change in the financial status of such Company Benefit Plan
since the date of the most recent such statements provided to Buyer by the
Company.

be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, such
party shall promptly inform the other. Each of Buyer, Acquisition Sub and the
Company agree to correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy
Statement which shall have become false or misleading. All documents that each

employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors,
financing sources, agents and other representatives, collectively, " _Buyer
Representatives_ ") and (y) any persons either listed on Section 6.5(a) of the
Buyer Disclosure Schedule or approved by the Company, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (and their respective
affiliates, officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal
counsel, financial advisors, financing sources, limited partners and limited
partners of affiliates and agents, collectively, " _Other Representatives_ ")
that have entered into or are contemplating entering into an agreement with
Buyer or Acquisition Sub with respect to purchasing after consummation of the

(including by reading available independent public accountant\'s work papers);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to provide
access to, or instruct the Company Representatives to provide access to, any

with any third-party, (ii) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other
privilege held by the Company, (iii) otherwise violate any applicable Laws or
(iv) which would result in a competitor of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries receiving material information which is competitively sensitive;
_provided_ , _further_ , however, that the Company will use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain any required consents for the disclosure of such
information or documents and take such other action (such as the redaction of
identifying or confidential information or entry into a joint defense
agreement or other arrangement to avoid loss of attorney client privilege)
with respect to such information or documents as is necessary to permit
disclosure to Buyer, the Buyer Representatives and the Other Representatives.

  

(b) The parties shall comply with, and shall cause the Buyer
Representatives and the Company Representatives, as applicable, to comply
with, all of their respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement;
provided, that Buyer shall be entitled to share Evaluation Material (as

Representative, and (ii) any Other Representatives to whom Buyer provides
Evaluation Material (for the avoidance of doubt, including information
provided to Buyer and the Buyer Representatives pursuant to Section 6.5(a))

indirectly, to a confidentiality agreement with the Company, prior to
receiving such Evaluation Material, agree with Buyer to be bound by the
confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. The parties
acknowledge and agree that in the period preceding the execution of this
Agreement, the Company undertook a process to explore strategic alternatives
as part of its continued effort to maximize shareholder value, including
entering into agreements similar to the Confidentiality Agreement with third
parties exploring the merits of a potential transaction (" _Third Party
Agreements_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, in the Confidentiality Agreement or in any Third Party Agreement:

  

(x) in accordance with Exhibit 6.5(b), the Company hereby irrevocably
waives clause (x) of the second sentence of paragraph 7 of the Confidentiality
Agreement and any provision of such Third Party Agreement (including
provisions similar to clause (x) of the second sentence of paragraph 7 of the
Confidentiality Agreement) and the Confidentiality Agreement to the extent
such provision, directly or indirectly, restricts such parties from submitting
an unsolicited and non-public Competing Proposal to the

  



  

51

     

Company (or, in the case of Buyer, from submitting an unsolicited and non-
public competing proposal to the Company in connection with a subsequent
agreement similar to this Agreement), and the Company and Buyer hereby
acknowledge that by virtue of this waiver, the Company shall be prevented from
enforcing any such provision against any such Third Party to the extent set
forth herein, and

  

(y) if any Competing Proposal is delivered to the Company as a result
of the waiver granted in (x) above, then the Company shall have the right to
waive any other rights the Company may have under the Third Party Agreements
in order to facilitate the exercise by the Company of its rights under Section
6.6 hereof, and any such waivers of the rights of the Company under any Third
Party Agreement in accordance with this Section 6.5(b) shall not constitute a
breach of this Agreement.

Representatives or Other Representatives detect any potential inadequacy in
the Companys information reporting or withholding (including backup
withholding) forms or procedures, at the reasonable request of Buyer, Buyer
Representatives or Other Representatives, the Company shall, and shall cause
each of its subsidiaries to, address such inadequacy, including,
without limitation, by requesting new forms from third parties, or by
implementing new procedures.

pursuant to Section 8.1, and except as otherwise contemplated by Section
6.5(b), the Company agrees that neither it nor any subsidiary of the Company

their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit,

propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend any Competing Proposal, or
(v) approve, endorse or recommend or publicly announce an intention to
approve, endorse or recommend, or enter into any letter of intent or similar
document or any agreement or commitment providing for, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing Proposal. Without limiting
the foregoing it is understood that any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by any subsidiary of the Company or any Company Representatives
shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.6 by the Company.

  

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its subsidiaries
and their respective Company Representatives to, immediately cease any
existing solicitations, discussions or negotiations with

  



  

52

     

any person (other than the parties hereto) that has made or indicated an
intention to make a Competing Proposal.

  

(c) Notwithstanding any limitations set forth in this Agreement, if
the Company receives an unsolicited Competing Proposal that (i) did not result
from a violation of Section 6.6(a) or (b) and (ii) the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith after consultation with the Company\'s
outside legal and financial advisors that such Competing Proposal constitutes
or could reasonably be expected to result, after the taking of any of the
actions referred to in either of clause (x) or (y) below, in a Superior
Proposal, the Company may at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, for so long as the Company is in compliance with its
obligations under this Section 6.6, take the following actions: (x) furnish
nonpublic information with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries to the
third party making such Competing Proposal, if, and only if, such information
has previously or contemporaneously been provided to Buyer and prior to so
furnishing such information, the Company receives from the third party an
executed confidentiality agreement substantially in the form of, and with
terms at least as restrictive of such third party as, the Confidentiality
Agreement is of Buyer (including with respect to the standstill provisions
thereof but subject to the exception set forth in the last sentence of Section
6.5(b)) and (y) engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with such
third party with respect to the Competing Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Company taking such
actions as described in clauses (x) and (y) above (and in any event within 48
hours), the Company shall provide written notice to Buyer of such
determination of the Board of Directors of the Company as provided for in
clause (ii) above, as applicable.

  

(d) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to
withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Buyer or Acquisition Sub,
its approval of this Agreement or the Company Recommendation or (ii) approve
or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or resolve to
approve or recommend, any Competing Proposal; (iii) take any action to render
the Rights Agreement inapplicable to any third person; or (iv) enter into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other
agreement relating to any Competing Proposal or (v) release any third party
from any confidentiality agreement (in the context of a Competing Proposal) or
standstill agreement to which the Company is a party or fail to enforce to
the fullest extent possible, or grant any waiver, request or consent to any
Competing Proposal under, any such agreement (each, a " _Change of
Recommendation_ ", except as provided or permitted by Section 6.5 and this
Section 6.6.

  

    



  |  

(e)

  |  

If prior to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, either:

  
---|---|--- 
   

 

(i) the Company receives an unsolicited Competing Proposal, the
Company is otherwise in compliance with its obligations under this Section 6.6
and the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith after
consultation with the Companys outside advisors that such Competing Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, or

  

(ii) other than in connection with a Competing Proposal, if the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith after consultation with
the

  



  

53

     

Companys outside advisors that the failure of the Board of Directors of the
Company to change, qualify, withhold or withdraw the Company Recommendation
would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary duties
to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law,

  

then the Board of Directors of the Company may change, qualify, withhold or
withdraw the Company Recommendation (a " _Permitted Change of Recommendation_
"); _provided_ , that with respect to clause (i), (x) the Company shall have
first (A) provided five Business Days\' prior written notice (a " _Notice of
Superior Proposal_ ") to Buyer that it is prepared to effect a Permitted
Change of Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal and specifying the
reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal
that are the basis of such proposed Permitted Change of Recommendation, and
the identity of the person making such proposed Superior Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any
material amendment to any other material term of any such Superior Proposal
shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new five Business Day
period), (B) provided to Buyer all materials and information delivered or made
available to the person or group of persons making such proposed Superior
Proposal, and (C) during such five Business Day period, if requested by Buyer,
engaged in good faith negotiations with Buyer to amend this Agreement in such
a manner that any Competing Proposal which was determined to be a Superior
Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal and (y) at the end of
such five Business Day Period (or at such earlier time following receipt of a
Notice of Superior Proposal that Buyer notifies the Company that it is not
interested in pursuing further negotiations to amend this Agreement), such
Competing Proposal has not been withdrawn and continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal (taking into account any changes, which have not been
withdrawn, to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Buyer
following a Notice of Superior Proposal, as a result of the negotiations
required by clause (C) or otherwise).

  

(f) The Company shall advise Buyer promptly (and in any event within
48 hours) of (i) any Competing Proposal or indication or inquiry with respect
to or that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Competing Proposal,
(ii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company or its
subsidiaries, other than requests for information not reasonably expected to
be related to a Competing Proposal, and (iii) any inquiry or request for
discussion or negotiation regarding a Competing Proposal, including in each
case the identity of the person making any such Competing Proposal or
indication or inquiry and the material terms of any such Competing Proposal or
indication or inquiry. The Company shall keep Buyer reasonably informed on a
reasonably current basis of any material change to the terms of any such
Competing Proposal or indication or inquiry.

  

(g) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in this Section 6.6,
and in accordance with Section 6.6(e)(i), if the Board of Directors of the
Company has effected a Permitted Change of Recommendation in compliance with
the requirements of Section 6.6(e)(i) and is not in breach of this Section
6.6, then the Board of Directors of the Company may cause the Company or any
of its subsidiaries to enter into a binding written agreement (a " _Superior
Proposal Agreement_ ") with respect to any such Superior Proposal and
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(g).

  



  

54

     

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or
the Board of Directors of the Company from (i) disclosing to the Company\'s
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if
the Board of Directors of the Company has reasonably determined in good faith,
after consultation with outside advisors, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with any applicable Law; _provided_ that if such disclosures have
the effect of causing a Change of Recommendation, Buyer shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h).

  

(i) As used in this Agreement, " _Competing Proposal_ " shall mean
any offer or proposal, or any indication of interest in making an offer or
proposal, made in writing by a person or group at any time which is structured
to permit such person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of at least
fifteen percent (15%) of the assets of, equity interest in, or businesses of,
the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, pursuant to a merger,
recapitalization, consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares
of capital stock, sale of assets, tender offer or exchange offer or similar
transaction, including any single or multi-step transaction or series of
related transactions, in each case other than the Merger.

  

(j) As used in this agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean
any bona fide Competing Proposal (except the reference therein to "fifteen
percent (15%)" shall be replaced by "ninety-five percent (95%)") that is on
terms that the Board of Directors of the Company has reasonably determined in
good faith (after consultation with the Company\'s outside financial advisors
and outside counsel and after considering such factors as the Board of
Directors of the Company considers to be appropriate, including the legal,
financial, timing, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal) would, if
consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable to the Company\'s
stockholders than the Merger and (y) is reasonably likely to be consummated on
the terms proposed.

Section 6.7

  |  

 _Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and Insurance_.

  
---|---|--- 
   

 

(a) Buyer and Acquisition Sub agree that all rights to exculpation
and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the
current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the
Company or its subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles of
association, certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable
organization documents) or in any agreement shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect. Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall
(and Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify, defend and
hold harmless, and advance expenses to Indemnitees with respect to all acts
or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would be permitted by
applicable Law and to the fullest extent required by the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws (or equivalent organizational
documents) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates as in
effect on the date of this Agreement.

  

(b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 6.7(a), during the
period ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent that the Company would be

  



  

55

     

permitted by applicable Law to do so, the Buyer will: (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnitee against and from any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (A) any action or
omission or alleged action or omission taken or not taken in such
Indemnitee\'s capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries or affiliates prior to the Effective Time; or (B) the
Merger, the Merger Agreement and any transactions contemplated hereby; and
(ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation the expenses (including attorneys\' fees) of any
Indemnitee upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee
to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee
is not entitled to be indemnified; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without either
Acquisition Sub\'s or the Surviving Corporation\'s prior written consent and
the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses
of more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable
Indemnitees) for all Indemnitees in any jurisdiction with respect to any
single such. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 6.7(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Buyer nor the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to)
settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or
otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, unless the use of one counsel for such
Indemnitees would present such counsel with a conflict of interest that would
make such joint representation inappropriate for which indemnification may be
sought under this Section 6.7(b) unless such settlement, compromise, consent
or termination includes an unconditional release of Indemnitees covered by the
settlement from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation.

  

(c) Buyer will provide or cause the Surviving Corporation shall
provide, for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, the
Indemnitees who are insured under the Company\'s directors\' and officers\'
insurance and indemnification policy with an insurance and indemnification
policy, or a "tail policy", in each case, that provides coverage for events
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is
no less favorable than the existing policy of the Company or, if substantially
equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required
to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance prior to the date
hereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, the Buyer or Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding such amount.

  

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this Section 6.7 applies shall be third
party beneficiaries of this Section 6.7. The provisions of this Section 6.7
are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee, his or her successors,
heirs or representatives.

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 9.1 or Section 9.6
hereof to the contrary, this Section 6.7 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all
successors and assigns of Buyer and the Surviving

  



  

56

     

Corporation, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their successors,
heirs or representatives. In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any
of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

  

Section 6.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Buyer, and Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, of
(i) any notice or other communication received by such party from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the this Agreement, the Merger or
the transactions contemplated hereby, or from any person alleging that the
consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or
the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be
material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Buyer, (ii) any actions,
suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such party\'s
knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party or any of its subsidiaries which relate to this
Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) the
discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause
or result in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII not
being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions being materially delayed
in violation of any provision of this Agreement; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall not (x) cure any
breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or
(y) limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice _provided_
, _further_ , that the failure to comply with this 6.8(iii) shall not
constitute a material breach of this Agreement for purposes of determining
whether the condition set forth in Section 7.3(b) has been satisfied. The
Company shall notify Buyer, on a reasonably current basis, of any events or
changes with respect to any material regulatory or other investigation or
action involving the Company or any of its affiliates by any Governmental
Authority, and shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer or its affiliates in
efforts to mitigate any adverse consequences to Buyer or its affiliates which
may arise (including by coordinating and providing assistance in meeting with
regulators).

  

Section 6.9 _Public Announcements_. Buyer and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making
any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the
prior consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed), except as may be required by Law or any listing agreement with
the NYSE to which Buyer or the Company is a party.

Section 6.10

  |  

 _Employee Matters_.

  
---|---|--- 
   

 

(a) For the period commencing on the Effective Time and ending on the
one-year anniversary thereof (the " _Benefit Continuation Period_ "), Buyer
shall provide or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to active
employees of the Company and any of its subsidiaries (" _Company Employees_ ")
compensation opportunities and benefits (excluding severance benefits which
are addressed in Section 6.10(b) below and excluding equity or equity-

  



  

57

     

based awards or incentives) that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the
compensation opportunities and benefits being provided to similarly situated
employees of Buyer; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, with
respect to Company Employees who cease to be employees of Buyer or any of its
affiliates and who become the employees of a successor employer in connection
with the Subsequent Transaction (each such Company Employee, a " _Transferred
Company Employee_ " and such successor employer, the " _Successor Employer_
"), the Successor Employer shall only be required to provide such Transferred
Company Employees, for the duration of the Benefit Continuation Period, with
compensation opportunities and benefits (including a basic program of medical,
dental and vision benefits for active employees, but excluding equity or
equity-based awards or incentives) that are substantially similar in the
aggregate to the compensation opportunities and benefits being provided to
such Transferred Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time
under the Company Benefit Plans.

  

(b) Buyer shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, to each Company Employee who experiences an involuntary termination
of employment during the Benefit Continuation Period, severance benefits based
on a severance benefit formula that is no less favorable than the severance
benefit formula that would have applied to such Company Employee upon a
termination of employment under the same circumstances immediately prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to the severance program or policy applicable to
such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time as set forth on
Section 6.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ , that such
severance benefits shall be determined without taking into account any
reduction after the Effective Time in the base salary or annual bonus
opportunity of such Company Employee in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time and used to determine severance benefits; _provided_ _further_
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall require Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation to provide severance benefits to any Company Employee in
connection with an involuntary termination of such Company Employee\'s
employment that occurs in connection with the sale of a subsidiary, division
or business, or any assets, of the Buyer or any of its affiliates (including,
without limitation, the Subsequent Transaction), where such Company Employee
is offered a comparable position of employment with the purchaser of such
subsidiary, division, business or assets. Subject to Section 6.10(d) hereof,
Buyer shall honor, fulfill and discharge, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor, fulfill and discharge, the Company\'s and its
subsidiaries\' obligations under any Company Benefit Plan. In addition,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall not be obligated
to provide severance to any Company Employee who is terminated as a result of
such Company Employees failure of any background check or violation of any
the Buyers standard hiring policies or procedures.

  

(c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to effectuate,
effective as of, and subject to, the occurrence of the Effective Time, a spin-
off of the assets and liabilities relating to Insurance and Retirement
Employees (as such term is defined in the Subsequent Transaction Agreement)
under The BISYS Group, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan (the " _Company 401(k)_ ")
into a separate defined contribution plan and trust having the same rights,
terms, features and options as the Company 401(k) (such plan and related
trust, the " _Insurance and Retirement 401(k)_ "). Prior to Closing, the
Company shall be responsible for taking all necessary, reasonable and
appropriate actions to establish, maintain and administer the Insurance and
Retirement 401(k) so that it is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and
so that the related trust thereunder is exempt from Section 501(a) of the
Code, including, without limitation, the

  



  

58

     

execution of any documents, adoption of any corporate resolutions or the
taking of any other reasonable actions to effectuate such spin-off.

  

(d) For purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not for purposes of
either benefit accrual or transition benefit credits under the Buyer\'s 401(k)
Plan) under any Employee Benefit Plan maintained by Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Corporation\'s subsidiaries and their respective
affiliates providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Closing ("
_Buyer Plans_ "), and for purposes of accrual of vacation and other paid time
off and severance benefits, whether under Buyer Plans or otherwise, each
Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Company, the Company\'s subsidiaries and their respective affiliates (and any
additional service with any predecessor employer) before the Closing, to the
same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to
credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan. In addition,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time or evidence of insurability, in any and all Buyer Plans to the extent
coverage under such Buyer Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company
Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before
the replacement; and (ii) for purposes of each Buyer Plan providing medical
benefits to any Company Employee, Buyer shall cause, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such Buyer Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her
covered dependents, and Buyer shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such employee and his or her covered dependents under a Company Benefit Plan
during the portion of the plan year of the Buyer Plan ending on the date such
employee\'s participation in the corresponding Buyer Plan begins to be taken
into account under such Buyer Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee
and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such Buyer Plan. For purposes of the
Subsequent Transaction Agreement and the obligations of the Successor Employer
in connection therewith, all references to "Buyer Plan" in this Section
6.10(d) shall refer to any Employee Benefit Plan maintained by the Successor
Employer and its subsidiaries and affiliates providing benefits to any
Transferred Company Employee after the Closing.

  

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are for the sole benefit of
the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person (including
for the avoidance of doubt, any Company Employee), other than the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or
equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided
for in this Section 6.10) under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement. Nothing in this Section 6.10 shall amend, or be deemed to amend,
any Company Benefit Plan or Buyer Plan. Nothing in this Section 6.10 shall
prevent the amendment or termination of any Company Benefit Plans by Buyer,
the Surviving Corporation or their respective subsidiaries and affiliates
or shall limit the right of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate the employment of any
Company Employee at any time.

  

Section 6.11 _Financing_. The Company shall and shall cause its
subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate in connection with the arrangement of
any financing by Buyer or any party to the Subsequent Transaction Agreement in
connection with the transactions contemplated by

  



  

59

     

this Agreement or the Subsequent Transaction Agreement (the " _Financing_ ")
as may be reasonably requested by Buyer or such party to the Subsequent
Transaction Agreement (provided that such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
subsidiaries and provided that the Buyer or such party to the Subsequent
Transaction Agreement agrees (in the case of the party to the Subsequent
Transaction Agreement, in writing) to promptly reimburse the Company for any
reasonable costs or expenses incurred in connection with such cooperation).
Such cooperation by the Company shall include, at the reasonable request of
Buyer or such party to the Subsequent Transaction Agreement, (i) providing to
the parties providing Financing all financial statements and other information
relating to the Company and its subsidiaries that are customarily required
for financings similar to the Financing and using reasonable best efforts to
provide such other financial information as Buyer or such party to the
Subsequent Transaction Agreement shall reasonably request in order to
consummate the Financing, (ii) participating in a reasonable number of
meetings, drafting sessions and due diligence sessions in connection with the
Financing, (iii) assisting in the preparation of (A) one or more offering
documents or confidential information memoranda for the Financing (including
the execution and delivery of one or more customary representation letters in
connection therewith); provided that any such memoranda and similar documents
need not be issued by the Company or any of its subsidiaries; provided,
further, that any such memoranda shall contain disclosure and financial
statements with respect to the Company or the Surviving Corporation reflecting
the Surviving Corporation and/or its subsidiaries as the obligor and (B)
materials for rating agency presentations, (iv) reasonably cooperating with
the marketing efforts for any of the Financing, including providing assistance
in the preparation for, and participating in, meetings, due diligence sessions
and similar presentations to and with, among others, prospective lenders,
investors and rating agencies, and (v) executing and delivering (or using
reasonable best efforts to obtain from advisors), and causing its subsidiaries
to execute and deliver (or use reasonable best efforts to obtain from
advisors), customary certificates (including a certificate of the chief
financial officer of the Company with respect to solvency matters), accounting
comfort letters, legal opinions (which may be reasoned in appropriate
circumstances), surveys, title insurance or other documents and instruments
relating to guarantees, the pledge of collateral and other matters ancillary
to the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Buyer or any party to the
Subsequent Transaction Agreement in connection with the Financing and
otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledge of collateral and providing of
guarantees contemplated with respect to the Financing; provided, however, that
no obligation of the Company or any of its subsidiaries under any such
certificate, document or instrument (other than the representation letter
referred to above) shall be effective until the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or
other fee or incur any other liability or obligation in connection with the
Financing (or any replacements thereof) prior to the Effective Time.

  

Section 6.12 _Settlements_. Pending the Merger, the Company shall take
all action required to comply with the provisions of the SEC Settlements, the
Class Action Settlement and the Derivative Action Settlement, and such actions
shall not constitute a basis for an alleged breach hereunder, and the Company
shall keep Buyer reasonably apprised of developments and discussions relating
to the SEC Settlements, the Class Action Settlement and the Derivative Action
Settlement and use good faith efforts to permit the Buyer to monitor or

  



  

60

     

participate in discussions with any Governmental Authority or adverse third
party relating to the SEC Settlements, the Class Action Settlement or the
Derivative Action Settlement.

  

Section 6.13 _Rule 16b-3 Exemption_. The Board of Directors of the
Company, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is
defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(b)(3) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt

officers and directors of Company Common Stock in exchange for the Merger
Consideration, and of Company Options in exchange for the Option Cash Payment,
in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, are
intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange
Act.

  

Section 6.14 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Buyer the
opportunity to participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement,
in, but not control, the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation
against he Company or its directors or officers relating to the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
settlement shall be agreed to without Buyer\'s consent.

Any such payment shall be reduced by any amounts as may be required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Tax Law.

understood that in no event shall Buyer be required to pay the fee referred to
in this Section 8.2(b) on more than one occasion. Any such payment shall be
reduced by any amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under applicable Tax Law.

  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt any action or inaction taken or not

this Agreement shall not be deemed to be an intentional breach of this
Agreement.

  

(d) In the event that the Company or the Buyer shall fail to pay the
Company Termination Fee or the Buyer Termination Fee, as the case may be,
required pursuant to this Section 8.2 when due, such Company Termination Fee
or the Buyer Termination Fee, as the case may be, shall accrue interest for

(e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the Company
Termination Fee, the Buyer Termination Fee and the other provisions of this
Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, that the Company Termination Fee, the Buyer Termination Fee and the
other provisions of this Section 8.2 are not subject to the requirement the
Requisite Stockholder Approval be obtained and these provisions shall be
effective without regard to whether the Requisite Stockholder Approval is
obtained. Each of the parties hereto further acknowledges that, without the
Company Termination Fee, the Buyer Termination Fee and the other provisions of
this Section 8.2, Buyer and the Company would not enter into this Agreement;
and that the Company Termination Fee and the Buyer Termination Fee are
not penalties, but rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Buyer and Acquisition Sub, or the Company, as the as may be,
for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

  

Section 8.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual
agreement of the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their
respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, after the adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the Merger by stockholders of the Company, there shall not be any
amendment that by Law or in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange
requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such
further approval of such stockholders nor any amendment or change not
permitted under applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto. 

  

Section 8.4 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) subject
to the proviso of Section 8.3, waive compliance with any agreement or
condition contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall only be valid
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be
bound thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the
Company, Buyer or Acquisition Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

  

Section 8.5 _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_. Except as set forth in Section
8.2, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses.

Section 9.3 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_. When a reference is
made in this Agreement to an Article, Section or Exhibit, such reference shall
be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement, unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings for this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The phrase "transactions contemplated by this Agreement" or "transactions
contemplated hereby" or phrases of similar import, when used in this
Agreement, shall not refer to the Subsequent Transaction or the transactions
contemplated by the Subsequent Transaction Agreement. All terms defined in
this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or
other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined
therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any statute defined
or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to
herein means such statute as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable
successor

  



  

68

     

statutes. References to a person are also to its permitted successors and
assigns. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties
and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

  

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible.

  

Section 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto, except that Buyer or Acquisition Sub may
assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all of its rights, interest and
obligations under this agreement to Buyer or any affiliate of Buyer, but no
such assignment shall relieve Buyer or Acquisition Sub of its obligations
hereunder.

  

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement (including the exhibits and schedules hereto) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the
parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each party hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement, other than after the Effective Time: (a)
the rights to indemnification and insurance pursuant to Section 6.7 hereof
(of which the persons entitled to indemnification are the intended
beneficiaries) and (b) the rights of the Companys stockholders and holders of
Restricted Stock Awards to receive the Merger Consideration and Company Option
holders to receive the Option Cash Payment.

  

Section 9.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any dispute arising
out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

  

    



  |  

Section 9.8

  |  

 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Enforcement_.

  
---|---|--- 
   

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto agrees that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.

69

Acquisition Sub and the Company hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and to the jurisdiction of
the United States District Court for the State of Delaware, for the purpose of
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and each
of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect to
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined exclusively in any
Delaware state or federal court. Each of Buyer, Acquisition Sub and the
Company agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law.

  

(b) Each of Buyer, Acquisition Sub and the Company irrevocably
consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in
any other action or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, on behalf of itself or its property, by personal delivery of
copies of such process to such party. Nothing in this Section 9.8 shall affect
the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
Law.

  

Section 9.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in two (2) or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  

Section 9.10 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF BUYER, ACQUISITION SUB AND
THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF
BUYER OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

_________________, 2007

  

Dear ________________:

  



  

Reference is made to the Confidentiality Agreement, between _________________
("you") and The BISYS Group, Inc. (the "Company"), dated as of
_________________ (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), and to the Agreement and
Plan of Merger, by and among Citibank N.A., Buckeye Acquisition Sub, Inc. and
the Company, dated as of May 1, 2007 (the "Merger Agreement"). Capitalized
terms used but not defined herein have the meaning given in the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

In accordance with the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement
and Section 6.5 of the Merger Agreement, the Company hereby irrevocably waives
clause _______ of paragraph ____ of the Confidentiality Agreement, which
prohibits you from requesting the Company (or the Company Representatives),
directly or indirectly, to amend or waive certain provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement to the extent such provision, directly or
indirectly, restricts you from submitting an unsolicited and non-public
Competing Proposal (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement). By
virtue of this waiver, the Company shall be prevented from enforcing any such
provision against you to the extent set forth herein.

  

By executing this waiver, you acknowledge and agree that any action taken by
the Company in accordance with Section 6.6 of the Merger Agreement will not
violate the Confidentiality Agreement.
