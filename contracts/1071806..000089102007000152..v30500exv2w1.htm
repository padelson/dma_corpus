ARTICLE III 

  

 _CONVERSION OF SHARES_

    

 Section 3.1 _Conversion of Shares_. 

   

 (a) At the Effective Time except as otherwise provided in Section 3.4(d), each share of the Companys common stock, $.01 par value (the " _Common_   _Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive $66.50 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") without any interest thereon. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Each share of common stock, $.01 par value, of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of the common stock, $.01 par value, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (c) All shares of Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any shares of Common Stock owned by Parent, Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent shall, at the Effective Time, be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (d) At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders immediately prior to the Effective Time of shares of outstanding Common Stock not represented by certificates (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and the holders of certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of outstanding Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such Book-Entry Shares or Certificates in accordance with _Section 3.2_, the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, for each such share of Common Stock held by them. 

  

 (e) If at any time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time any change in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the amount of the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(a)_ shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change. 

  

 Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_. 

   

 (a) At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deliver, in trust, to Mellon Investor Services L.L.C. (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Common Stock at the Effective Time, sufficient funds for timely payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Consideration Fund_ ") to be paid pursuant to this  _Section 3.2_ in respect of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, assuming no Dissenting Shares. In the event the Consideration Fund shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration contemplated by _Section 3.1_, Parent shall promptly deliver, or cause to be delivered, additional funds to the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency required to make such payments. 

  

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares whose shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1_ (i) a letter of transmittal that shall specify that delivery of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have occurred, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger 

   ##### 

  

 

Consideration, the form and substance of which letter of transmittal and
instructions shall be substantially as reasonably agreed to by the Company
and Parent and prepared prior to the Closing. Upon surrender of a Book-Entry
Share or a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with
such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and with such other documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Book-Entry Share or
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, subject to any
required withholding of Taxes, the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
provisions of this  _Article III_, and the Book-Entry Share or Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Book-Entry Shares
or Certificates. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than a Person in whose name the Book-Entry Share or Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of
such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Book-Entry Share or Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable. 

   

 (c) The Consideration Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such investments shall be in money market mutual or similar funds having assets in excess of $10,000,000,000. Earnings on the Consideration Fund shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs. No investment of the Consideration Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from promptly making the payments required by this _Article III_, and following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Consideration Fund. 

  

 (d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article III_, except as otherwise provided by Law. 

  

 (e) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former shareholders of the Company one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ with respect to such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration in respect thereof. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash from the Consideration Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on 

   ##### 

  

 

which any Merger Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, and any holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
who has not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ with respect
thereto shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment
of their claim for Merger Consideration in respect thereof. 

   

 (g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact (such affidavit shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Paying Agent) by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which such Person is entitled in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this  _Article III_. 

  

 Section 3.3 _Shares of Dissenting Shareholders_. 

   

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement other than Section 3.3(b) to the contrary, any shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a shareholder who is entitled to dissent from the Merger under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA and who has exercised, when and in the manner required by Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA to the extent so required prior to the Effective Time, such right to dissent and to obtain payment of the fair value of such shares under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA in connection with the Merger (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration unless and until such shareholder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such shareholders right to obtain payment of the fair value of such shareholders Dissenting Shares under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA, but shall instead be entitled only to such rights with respect to such Dissenting Shares as may be granted to such shareholder under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA. From and after the Effective Time, Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to vote for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of dividends or other distributions (except dividends or other distributions payable to shareholders of record prior to the Effective Time). The Company shall promptly provide any notices of dissent to Parent. 

  

 (b) If any shareholder who holds Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such shareholders right to obtain payment of the fair value of such shareholders Dissenting Shares under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such effective withdrawal or loss, such shareholders shares of Common Stock shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and, if the occurrence of such effective withdrawal or loss is later than the Effective Time, shall be treated as if they had as of the Effective Time been converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration as set forth in subsection (a) of _Section 3.1_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 3.4 _Treatment of Stock Options; Restricted Shares_. 

   

 (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement and to the extent necessary, the board of directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Option Plans) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as are required with respect to outstanding options to purchase shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the Company Option Plans, to the extent vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time or as a result of the Merger (" _Vested Options_ "), such that each Vested Option outstanding at the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Common Stock and shall instead represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of Common Stock that would have been issuable upon exercise of the Vested Option prior to the Effective Time less the applicable exercise price for such share of Common Stock under such Vested Option (such net amount, the " _Option Per Share Amount"_ ). Parent shall promptly pay or cause to be paid immediately after the Effective Time to the holders of Vested Options as of immediately prior to the Effective Time the Option Per Share Amount (less any applicable tax withholding) for each share of Common Stock that would have been issued upon exercise of the Vested Options. 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, each of the outstanding options to purchase shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the Company Option Plans to the extent not vested or exercisable prior to or as a result of the consummation of the Merger (the " _Unvested Options_ ") shall, without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, be converted into an option granted pursuant to the Parent Corporation 2001 Stock Plan, as amended and restated (the " _Parent 2001 Stock Plan_ "), to purchase that number of shares of common stock, par value $0.00000625 per share, of Parent (the " _Parent Common Shares_ ") determined by multiplying the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Unvested Option at the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio (as defined below), at an exercise price per Parent Common Share equal to the exercise price per share of such Unvested Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) (a " _Substituted Parent Option_ "). If the foregoing calculation results in a Substituted Parent Option being exercisable for a fraction of a Parent Common Share, then the number of Parent Common Shares subject to such option shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares. 

  

 (c) The Substituted Parent Options shall have the same vesting schedule (including any acceleration of vesting as provided in the Company Option Plans) as the Unvested Options and otherwise shall have the terms and conditions as set forth in such Substituted Parent Options; provided that Parent shall convert Unvested Options into Substituted Parent Options in such a manner as to ensure that (i) the Substituted Parent Options are not subject to Section 409A of the Code as a result of the substitution and (ii) Substituted Parent Options received with respect to Unvested Options that were "incentive stock options" within the meaning of section 422 of the Code will satisfy the requirement of section 424(a) of the Code and continue to be "incentive stock options" within the meaning of section 422 of the Code. As a result of such conversion, the Substituted Parent Options shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Parent 2001 Stock Plan and grant agreements for the Substituted Parent Options (rather than the terms and conditions of the plan and grant agreements under which the Unvested Options were originally issued). Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall take all actions (including causing its board of directors, the compensation committee of Companys board of directors, or a 

   ##### 

  

 

committee overseeing the Company Option Plans to take all actions) that are
necessary to confirm that the Substituted Parent Options are "equivalent" and
"comparable" options, as applicable, under the terms of the Company Option
Plans or otherwise such that vesting in Unvested Options will not be
accelerated as a result of the Merger, this Agreement, or the
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Transactions_ ") (including the
exchange of the Substituted Parent Options for the Unvested Options) and that
are otherwise necessary to ensure that the Unvested Options may be
substituted as provided in this Section 3.4(c). For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean the number determined by dividing
the Merger Consideration by the average of the closing prices of a Parent
Common Share as publicly reported for the Nasdaq Global Market System as of
4:00 p.m. Eastern Time for each of the 10 consecutive trading
days immediately preceding the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, Company Restricted Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into that number of restricted shares (" _Parent Restricted Shares_ ") or restricted stock units of Parent Common Shares (such restricted stock units together with Parent Restricted Shares, "Substitute Deferred Compensation") with an equivalent after tax economic effect (and with no detrimental effect on the holder thereof) determined by multiplying the number of Company Restricted Shares by the Exchange Ratio. Any Substitute Deferred Compensation issued pursuant to this Section 3.4(d) shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Restricted Shares (including the vesting schedule and any acceleration of vesting pursuant to any Company Option Plans) except to the extent changes to the terms and conditions are otherwise agreed to between Parent and the holder of the Parent Restricted Shares.

a party or by which any of them or any of their properties or assets is
bound, (iii) violate any Law applicable to the Company, any of its

defaults that, or filings, registrations, notifications, authorizations,
consents or approvals the failure of which to make or obtain, (1) would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect
and would not materially adversely affect the ability of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, or (2) would occur or be
required as a result of the business or activities in which Parent or Sub
is or proposes to be engaged or as a result of any acts or omissions by, or
the status of any facts pertaining to, Parent or Sub.

The Company has filed all reports and other documents with the SEC required to be filed or furnished by the Company since December 31, 2004 (such documents, together with any reports filed during such period by the Company with the SEC on a voluntary basis on Form 8-K, the " _Company SEC Reports_ ").

transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, (ii)
violate applicable Law or the provisions of any agreement to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (iii) jeopardize any
attorney-client or other legal privilege; _provided further_ ,  _however_ ,
that nothing herein shall authorize Parent or its Representatives to undertake
any further investigation of the Company, including environmental
investigations or sampling at any of the properties owned, operated or leased
by the Company or its Subsidiaries. Parent agrees that it will not, and will
cause its Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to
this  _Section 6.2_ for any competitive or other purpose unrelated to the

2007 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between the Company and Parent
shall apply with respect to information furnished by the Company, its
Subsidiaries and the Companys officers, employees, and other
Representatives hereunder. 

   

 Section 6.3 _Acquisition Proposals_. 

   

 (a) The Company and its Subsidiaries will not, and will use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective officers, directors, employees and other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) initiate, encourage, facilitate, solicit, or participate or engage in any negotiations, inquiries, or discussions with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) in connection with any potential Acquisition Proposal, disclose or furnish any nonpublic information or data to any Person concerning the Companys business or properties or afford any Person other than Parent or its Representatives access to its properties, books, or records, except as required by law or pursuant to a governmental request for information, (iii) enter into or execute, or propose to enter into or execute, any agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) approve, endorse, recommend or make or authorize any public statement, recommendation, or solicitation in support of any Acquisition Proposal or any offer or proposal relating to an Acquisition Proposal other than with respect to the Merger. The Company will, and will direct its Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated all discussions and negotiations that commenced prior to the date of this Agreement regarding any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, and shall request that all confidential or proprietary information previously furnished to any such third parties be promptly returned or destroyed. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event that the Company is contacted by any third party expressing an interest in discussing a possible Acquisition Proposal or receives an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, the Company and its board of directors may participate in discussions or negotiations (including, as a part thereof, making any counterproposal) with, or furnish any non-public information to, any Person or Persons (but only after such Person enters into a customary confidentiality agreement 

   ##### 

  

 

with the Company (which confidentiality agreement (i) must be no less
restrictive in the aggregate to the Person making such proposal than the
Confidentiality Agreement, (ii) may not provide for an exclusive right
to negotiate with the Company and (iii) may not restrict the Company from
complying with this Section 6.3(b))) making such contact or making such
Acquisition Proposal and their respective Representatives , prior to Company
Shareholder Approval, in each case, if and to the extent that (A) the
Companys board of directors determines in good faith, by resolution duly
adopted, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Person or Persons have submitted to the Company an
Acquisition Proposal that is, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Superior Proposal, and (B) the Companys board of directors determines in good
faith, by resolution duly adopted, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to participate in such discussions or negotiations,
furnish such information, enter into any agreement related to any Acquisition
Proposal or accept any offer or proposal relating to an Acquisition Proposal
would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. In addition, nothing herein shall restrict the
Company from complying with its disclosure obligations with regard to any
Acquisition Proposal under applicable Law. 

   

 (c) The Company will as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within 24 hours after receipt) notify Parent of the receipt by the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or of any expression of interest from a Person in discussing a possible Acquisition Proposal, and the identity of the Person or Persons making such Acquisition Proposal or expression of interest. The Company will provide Parent with a correct and complete copy of any confidentiality agreement entered into pursuant to Section 6.3(b) within 24 hours after execution thereof. The Company will provide Parent with 24 hours prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of its board of directors) of any meeting of its board of directors at which its board of directors would reasonably be expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal or any such inquiry or to consider providing nonpublic information to any Person. The Company shall notify Parent, in writing, of any decision of its board of directors as to whether to consider any Acquisition Proposal or to enter into discussions or negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal or to provide non-public information with respect to the Company to any Person in compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.3, which notice shall be given as promptly as practicable after such meeting (and in any event no later than 24 hours after such determination was reached). The Company will (i) provide Parent with oral and written notice setting forth all such information as is reasonably necessary to keep Parent currently informed in all material respects of the status and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal and of any material amendments or proposed material amendments thereto (including negotiations contemplated by Section 6.3(b)), (ii) promptly provide Parent a copy of all written information subsequently provided to, by or on behalf of such Person or group in connection with any Acquisition Proposal and (iii) promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of such determination) notify Parent of any determination by the Companys board of directors that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. 

  

 (d) Subject to _Section 6.3(e)_, unless and until this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_, neither the board of directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall, directly or indirectly, (A)(i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the Parent or Sub, the approval or recommendation or declaration of advisability by the board of directors of the Company or any such committee 

   ##### 

  

 

thereof of the Merger as set forth in _Section 6.7_; (ii) approve, adopt, or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve, adopt, or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) in the event of a tender offer or exchange
offer for any outstanding Company Common Shares, fail to recommend
against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by Companys
shareholders within ten (10) Business Days of the commencement thereof (for
the avoidance of doubt, the taking of no position or a neutral position by
the board of directors of the Company in respect of the acceptance of
any tender offer or exchange offer by its shareholders shall constitute a
failure to recommend against any such offer) (any action described in clauses
(i)-(iii) being referred to as a " _Change of Recommendation_ ") or (B)
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or allow
the Company to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement,
or other similar agreement, arrangement, or understanding (i) constituting or
related to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) requiring it to abandon, terminate, or fail
to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, prior to the Company Special Meeting, the Companys board of directors receives a Superior Proposal that has not been withdrawn, the Companys board of directors may, if the Companys board of directors by resolution duly adopted determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, may make a Change of Recommendation, approve or recommend such Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement as permitted pursuant to the terms of _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ ; _provided_ that: 

   

 (i) the Company notifies the Parent that it intends to take such action, which notice must specify the reasons for taking such action, the identity of the party making such proposal and the material terms and conditions of such proposal; and 

   

 (ii) Parent shall not have proposed, within three (3) Business Days after receipt of such notice from the Company, to amend this Agreement to provide for terms the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor, to be as favorable as or superior to those of the Superior Proposal. 

  

 (f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.3_ shall prohibit the Company or its board of directors from taking and disclosing to the Companys shareholders a position with respect to a tender offer or exchange offer by a third party or from taking any action or making any disclosure required by applicable Law; _provided_ that the content of the disclosure complies with this  _Section 6.3_.

Each applicable Parent Plan shall waive eligibility waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements and pre-existing condition limitations to the extent (i) waived or not included under the corresponding Benefit Plan and (ii) permitted by the applicable insurance policy under the Parent Plan. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 6.5 _Publicity_. The initial press release by each of Parent and the Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be acceptable to Parent and the Company. Neither the Company nor Parent (nor any of their respective Affiliates) shall issue any other press release or make any other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior agreement of the other party, except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with a national securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before making any such public announcements; _provided_ that the Company will no longer be required to obtain the prior agreement of or consult with Parent in connection with any such press release or public announcement if the Companys board of directors has effected a Change of Recommendation or in connection with any such press release or public announcement pursuant to _Section 6.3(f)_.

 (b) Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect for not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries for the Indemnified Parties and any other employees, agents or other individuals otherwise covered by such insurance policies prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Insured Parties_ ") with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ that in lieu of the purchase of such insurance by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the Company may at its option prior to the Effective Time purchase a six-year run-off (Extended Reporting Period) program for directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance. 

  

 (c) This _Section 6.6_ is intended to benefit the Insured Parties and the Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation.
