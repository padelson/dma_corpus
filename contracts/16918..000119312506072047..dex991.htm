but not the obligation, to propose to amend the terms of the Transactions. The
board of directors will review any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of
the Transactions in order to determine, in good faith in the exercise of its
fiduciary duties, whether Parents proposal to amend the Transactions would
result in the Acquisition Proposal not being a Superior Proposal compared to
the proposed amendment to the terms of the Transactions.

form and content of any such press release.

Acquisition Reorganization") as Parent may reasonably request prior to the
Effective Date, and the Plan of Arrangement, if required, shall be modified
accordingly; provided, however, that the Company need not effect a Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization which in the opinion of the Company,
acting reasonably, (i) would require the Company to obtain the approval of
the Shareholders in respect of such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization other than
at the Meeting, (ii) would prejudice the Companys Shareholders in any
material respect, (iii) would impede or materially delay the consummation of
the Transactions, or (iv) cannot either be completed immediately prior to or
contemporaneously with the Effective Time, or cannot be reversed or unwound
without adversely affecting the Company and the Subsidiaries taking into
account the Parents reimbursement obligations. If the Arrangement is not
completed, Parent shall forthwith reimburse the Company for all reasonable
fees and expenses (including any professional fees and expenses) incurred by
the Company and the Subsidiaries in considering or effecting a Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization and shall be responsible for any costs of the Company and the

     | (i) | cause any of the representations or warranties of the other
Party contained herein to be untrue or inaccurate on the date hereof or on the
Effective Time such that the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 or Section
5.3, as applicable would not be satisfied as of the Effective Time; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | result in the failure in any material respect to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by the other hereunder prior to the Effective Time such that the
conditions set forth in Section 5.2 or Section 5.3, as applicable would not be
satisfied as of the Effective Time. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Neither Parent nor the Company may seek to rely upon any
conditions precedent contained in Section 5.1, Section 5.2 or Section 5.3, or
exercise any termination right arising therefrom, unless forthwith and in any
event prior to the filing of the Articles of Arrangement for acceptance by the
Director, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, has delivered a written
notice to the other specifying in reasonable detail all breaches of
covenants, representations and warranties or other matters which Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, are asserting as the basis for the non-fulfilment
of the applicable condition precedent or the exercise of the
termination right, as the case may be. If any such notice is delivered,
provided that the Company or Parent, as the case may be, is proceeding
diligently to cure such matter, if such matter is susceptible to being cured
(for greater certainty, except by way of disclosure in the case of
representations and warranties), the other may not terminate this Agreement as
a result thereof until expiration of a period of 10 days from such notice. If
such notice has been delivered prior to the date of the Meeting, such Meeting
shall, unless the Parties agree otherwise, be postponed or adjourned until the
expiry of such period. If such notice has been delivered prior to the making
of the application for the Final Order or the filing of the Articles
of Arrangement with the Director, such application and such filing shall be
postponed until the expiry of such period. For greater certainty, in the event
that such matter is cured within the time period referred to herein without a
material adverse effect on the Party in breach, this Agreement may not be
terminated as a result of the cured breach. 
---|---|--- 



 

-44- Section 5.5 Satisfaction of Conditions

The conditions precedent set out in Section 5.1, Section 5.2 and Section 5.3
shall be conclusively deemed to have been satisfied, waived or released
when, with the agreement of Parent and the Company, a Certificate of
Arrangement in respect of the Arrangement is issued by the Director.

ARTICLE 6

AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

Section 6.1 Amendment

This Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement may, at any time and from time to
time before or after the holding of the Meeting but not later than the
Effective Date, be amended by mutual written agreement of the Parties, and any

warranty contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto;

---|---|--- 

Section 6.2 Termination

This Agreement may be terminated and the Arrangement may be abandoned at any
time prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding any requisite approval and
authorization of this Agreement by Shareholders:



     | (a) | by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company duly
authorized by the boards of directors of Parent and the Company; 
---|---|--- 


     | (b) | by either Parent or the Company if the Effective Time shall
not have occurred on or before June 29, 2006; provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 6.2(b) shall not be
available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective
Time to occur on or before such date; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Entity
shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law which has
become final and nonappealable and has the effect of making the Arrangement
illegal or otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of the
Arrangement; 
---|---|--- 



 

-45- Resolution shall have failed to receive the requisite vote for approval at the
Special Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof in accordance
with the Interim Order; 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | by Parent if the Meeting has not occurred on or before June
15, 2006; 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | by Parent, if: (i) the Companys board of directors
withdraws, modifies, changes or qualifies its approval or recommendation of
this Agreement or the Transactions in any manner adverse to Parent; or (ii)
the Companys board of directors or any committee thereof recommends or

Proposal; 
---|---|--- 


     | (g) | by Parent, if the Companys board of directors fails to
publicly affirm its approval or recommendation of the Transactions within five
business days of any written request to do so from Parent (or, in the event
that the Meeting shall be scheduled to take place within such five business
days, prior to the scheduled time of the Meeting) provided that the written
request is not provided during an Acquisition Proposal Assessment Period; 
---|---|--- 



     | (h) | by the Company, if the Company publicly proposes to or does
enter into a Proposed Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in
compliance with the provisions of Section 4.3(f), provided that the Company
has previously or concurrently will have paid to Parent the applicable Company
Termination Payment and further provided that the Company has not breached any
of its covenants, agreements or obligations in this Agreement;  
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | by Parent, if there has been a breach of or failure to
perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the
Company set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i)
would cause the conditions set forth in Section 5.2(a) or (b) not to be
satisfied and (ii) is incapable of being cured; or 
---|---|--- 


     | (j) | by the Company, if there has been a breach of or failure to
perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of
Parent set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i)
would cause the conditions set forth in Section 5.3(a) or (b) not to be
satisfied and (ii) is incapable of being cured. 
---|---|--- 
If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the foregoing provisions of
this Section 6.2, no Party shall have any further liability to perform
its obligations under this Agreement except as provided in Section 6.3 and as
otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, and provided that neither
the termination of this Agreement nor anything contained in this Section 6.2
shall relieve any Party from any liability for any breach by it of this
Agreement, including from any inaccuracy in its representations and warranties
and any non-performance by it of its covenants made herein.



 

-46- Section 6.3 Break Fees



     | (a) | The Company shall pay the Company Termination Payment to
Parent, by way of a wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account
specified by Parent, if:  
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | this Agreement is terminated in the circumstances set out in
Section Section 6.2(f), (g) or (h); 
---|---|--- 


     | (ii) | this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
6.2(i) as a result of the Company being in default of any of its obligations
or covenants contained in Section 4.3; or  
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | (A) prior to the termination of this Agreement an
Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced or otherwise made (a "Public
Acquisition Proposal"); and (B) during the period commencing on the date
hereof and ending 12 months following the termination of this Agreement (X) an
Acquisition Proposal is consummated by the Person who publicly announced the
Public Acquisition Proposal or any person acting jointly or in concert with
such Person, or (Y) the Companys board of directors approves or recommends an
Acquisition Proposal with the Person who publicly announced the Public
Acquisition Proposal, or the Company enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Public Acquisition Proposal, and in either case that
Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated at any time thereafter. 
---|---|--- 

Such payment shall be due: (A) in the case of a termination specified in
clause (i) or (ii) above, forthwith (and in any event within five business
days) following the termination of this Agreement but prior to or
concurrently with termination in the case of a termination pursuant to Section
6.2(h); and (B) in the case of the circumstances specified in clause (iii)
above, prior to or concurrently with the consummation of the
Acquisition Proposal.



     | (b) | The Company acknowledges that the amount set out in this
Section 6.3 in respect of the Company Termination Payment represents
liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-estimate of the damages, including
opportunity costs, which Parent will suffer or incur as a result of the event
giving rise to such damages and resultant termination of this Agreement, and
is not a penalty. The Company irrevocably waives any right it may have to
raise as a defence that any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. 
---|---|--- 

Section 6.4 Remedies

Subject to Section 6.3, the Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that an award
of money damages would be inadequate for any breach of this Agreement by any
Party or its representatives and any such breach would cause the non-breaching
Party irreparable harm. Accordingly, the Parties hereto agree that, in the
event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by one of the
Parties, the non-breaching Party will also be entitled, without the
requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief,
including injunctive relief and



 

-47- specific performance. Such remedies will not be the exclusive remedies for any
breach of this Agreement but will be in addition to all other remedies
available at law or equity to each of the Parties.

ARTICLE 4

CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENTS



   4.1 | Exchange of Certificates for Cash 
---|--- 



     | (a) | At or before the time of filing of the Articles of
Arrangement, Acquisition Sub shall deposit with the Depositary in escrow for
the benefit of Shareholders, cash in the aggregate amount equal to the
payments contemplated by sections 2.3(a) and 2.3(d). Upon surrender to the
Depositary for cancellation of a certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Common Shares that were exchanged
for cash, together with a duly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal
and such additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably
require, the Shareholder of such surrendered certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, and the Parent shall cause the Depositary to
deliver to such Shareholder, the cash which such Shareholder has the right to
receive under the Arrangement for such Common Shares, less any amounts
withheld pursuant to section 4.3 and any certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. The cash deposited with the Depositary shall be held
in an interest-bearing account, and any interest earned on such funds shall be
for the account of Acquisition Sub.  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Until surrendered as contemplated by this section 4.1, each
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Common
Shares shall be deemed after the Effective Time to represent only the right
to receive upon such surrender a cash payment in lieu of such certificate as
contemplated in this section 4.1, less any amounts withheld pursuant to
section 4.3. Any such certificate formerly representing Common Shares not
duly surrendered on or before the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date
shall cease to represent a claim by or interest of any former Shareholder of
any kind or nature against or in the Company, Parent or Acquisition Sub. On
such date, all Common Shares to which the former holder of such certificate
was entitled shall be deemed to have been surrendered to Acquisition Sub and
cash to which such former holder was entitled shall be deemed to have been
surrendered to Parent.  
---|---|--- 



 

\- 8 - deposit with the Depositary the amount of cash required to satisfy the payment
obligations of the Company pursuant to sections 2.3(b), 2.3(c), 2.3(f) and
2.3(g) such amount to be held for purposes of such obligations. The cash shall
be held in a separate interest-bearing account and any interest earned on such
funds shall be for the account of the Company. On or as soon as practicable
after the Effective Date, the Depositary shall deliver on behalf of the
Company to each Optionholder, each holder of RSUs, each holder of DSUs, each
holder of Director DSUs and participants under the Employee Share Purchase
Plan on whose behalf Purchase Plan Shares are being held by the Purchase Plan
Trustee as reflected on the books and records of the Company a cheque
representing the payment to which such holder is entitled in accordance with
sections 2.3(b), 2.3(c), 2.3(f) and 2.3(g) against receipt of such
documentation as Parent or the Company may reasonably require acknowledging
the transfer and/or termination of the Options, RSUs, DSUs or Director DSUs,
as the case may be, held by such holder.  
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Any payment made by way of cheque by the Depositary on
behalf of Acquisition Sub or the Company that has not been deposited or has
been returned to the Depositary or that otherwise remains unclaimed, in each
case, on or before the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date, shall cease to
represent a right or claim of any kind or nature and the right of the holder
to receive the consideration for Common Shares, Options, RSUs, DSUs, Director
DSUs or Purchase Plan Shares, as the case may be, pursuant to this Plan of
Arrangement shall terminate and be deemed to be surrendered and forfeited to
Acquisition Sub or the Company, as applicable. 
---|---|--- 


   4.2 | Lost Certificates 
---|--- 

In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Common Shares that were exchanged pursuant
to section 2.3 shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, cash deliverable in accordance with such
holders Letter of Transmittal. When authorizing such payment in exchange for
any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Person to whom such cash is to
be delivered shall as a condition precedent to the delivery of such cash, give
a bond satisfactory to Acquisition Sub and the Depositary in such sum as
Acquisition Sub may direct, or otherwise indemnify Acquisition Sub and the
Company in a manner satisfactory to Acquisition Sub and the Company, against
any claim that may be made against Acquisition Sub and the Company with
respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.



   4.3 | Withholding Rights 
---|--- 

The Company, Acquisition Sub, Parent and the Depositary shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable to any
Shareholder (including Employee Share Purchase Plan participants on whose
behalf the Purchase Plan Shares are being held, if required),
Optionholder, holder of RSUs, holder of DSUs and holder of Director DSUs such



 

\- 9 - amounts as the Company, Acquisition Sub, Parent or the Depositary is required
or permitted to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the
ITA, the United States _Internal Revenue Code of 1986_ or any provision of
federal, provincial, state, local or foreign tax law, in each case, as
amended. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid to the holder of
the Common Shares, Optionholder, holder of RSUs, holder of DSUs or holder of
Director DSUs, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually
remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.
