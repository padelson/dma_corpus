_Dispute Notice_ ") to Purchaser within thirty (30) days after receipt by the
Seller Representative of the Purchase Price Certificate, stating, on behalf of
the Sellers, that the Sellers object to any item in the Purchase Price
Certificate, specifying the basis for such objection, the Seller
Representative and Purchaser will attempt to resolve and finally determine and
agree upon such item as promptly as practicable. If the Seller Representative
does not deliver a Dispute Notice to Purchaser within such thirty (30) day
period, then the Closing Purchase Price specified in the Purchase Price
Certificate will be deemed to be true and correct in all respects and will be
final and binding upon the parties. To the extent that any items that are
components of the Estimated Purchase Price are not disputed in the Purchase
Price Certificate or components in the Purchase Price Certificate are not

(c) If the Seller Representative and Purchaser are unable to agree upon the
Closing Purchase Price within fifteen (15) days after delivery of the Dispute
Notice, then the Seller Representative and Purchaser shall submit the items in

to act, an independent, nationally recognized accounting firm reasonably
acceptable to each of the Seller Representative and Purchaser, will resolve
the items in dispute and calculate the Closing Purchase Price (such firm, the
" _Accounting Firm_ "). The Accounting Firm will make a determination of the
Closing Purchase Price. The Accounting Firm shall address only those items in
dispute and may not determine a Closing Purchase Price greater than the
greatest price claimed by either party or smaller than the smallest price
claimed by either party. The determination of the Accounting Firm will be made
within sixty (60) days after submission of the items in dispute and such
determination shall constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and
non-appealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having
jurisdiction thereover. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm
will be borne pro rata as between the Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser,
on the other hand, in proportion to the final allocation made by such
Accounting Firm of the disputed items in relation to the claims made by the
Seller Representative and Purchaser, such that the prevailing party pays the
lesser proportion of such fees, costs and expenses.

(d) Within ten (10) Business Days after such time as the Closing Purchase
Price is finally determined in writing as described above (or as otherwise
agreed to by Purchaser and the Seller Representative):

 

(i) if the Closing Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price,

immediately available funds to an account selected by the Seller
Representative (for distribution amongst the Sellers based on their Pro Rata
Portions) an amount equal to the Positive Adjustment Amount; or

Seller Representative and Purchaser shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a Joint
Direction instructing the Escrow Agent to pay Purchaser an amount equal to the
Negative Adjustment Amount.

(e) Payment of any amounts due as set forth in Section 2.7(d) shall constitute
full and final settlement of all claims or disputes related to the calculation
of the Closing Purchase Price. No adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price
pursuant to this Section 2.7 shall be considered a breach of any
representation, warranty or other provision of this Agreement.

two, three or four of Joanne Webb, Donald Leeper, Gary Hullquist or Paul

Thousand Dollars ($18,750,000), Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($12,500,000), Six Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($6,250,000) and

effect and binding and enforceable against the Company and, to Companys
Knowledge, against the lessors thereof, except as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
or relating to creditors rights generally and general principles of equity,
regardless of whether asserted in a proceeding in equity or at law. No
written notice of default under any Real Property Lease has been received by
the Company which remains uncured, no written termination notice under any
Real Property Lease has been received by the Company, and no 

 



17  uncured default on the part of the Company or to the Knowledge of the
Company, the landlord, exists under any Real Property Lease. Except as set
forth on _Schedule 3.8(b)_, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby will not, result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event
that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under or
give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of any Real Property Leases, or otherwise materially adversely
affect the continued use and possession of the Leased Real Property for
the conduct of business as presently conducted.

(c) All of the land, buildings, structures and other improvements used by
the Company in the conduct of the Company Business are included in the Leased
Real Property. Each Leased Real Property is in good operating condition and
repair and is suitable for the conduct of the business as presently conducted
therein. To the Companys Knowledge, the operation of the Company Business on
the Leased Real Property complies in all material respects with any
Requirements of Law relating to such property or operations thereon. Based on
the current condition of the Leased Real Property, the Company could not be
reasonably likely to be required to expend more than $50,000 in causing any
Leased Real Property to comply with the surrender conditions set forth in the
applicable Real Property Lease. The Company has performed all of its
obligations under any termination agreements pursuant to which it has
terminated any leases of real property that are no longer in effect and has no
continuing liability with respect to such terminated real property leases.
The Company is not party to any agreement or subject to any claim that may
require the payment of any real estate brokerage commissions, and no such
commission is owed with respect to any of the Leased Real Property.

 

(d) No person or entity has been granted by the Company pursuant to a written
agreement or pursuant to any other agreement, oral or otherwise, any right to
the possession, use, occupancy or enjoyment of the Leased Real Property or any
portion thereof.

(e) Neither the Sellers nor the Company own or hold, or are obligated under
or a party to, any option, right of first refusal or other contractual right
to purchase, acquire, sell, dispose of or lease the Leased Real Property or
any portion thereof or interest therein.

(f) The Company has not received written notice of any sale or other
disposition of the Leased Real Property or any part thereof.

for any such waiver or extension is currently pending.

(d) No audit or other proceeding by any Governmental Authority is pending or,
to the Companys Knowledge, threatened with respect to any Taxes due from or
with respect to the Company and no Governmental Authority has given written
notice to Company of any intention to assert any deficiency or claim for
additional Taxes against or with respect thereto. No claim has ever been made
by a Governmental Authority that the Company is or may be subject to taxation

7121 of the Code executed prior to the Closing, (or in the case of each of (1)
and (2), under any similar Requirement of Law), (3) installment sale or open
transaction disposition consummated prior to the Closing, or (4) prepaid
amount received prior to the Closing.

(k) The Company is and has been an S corporation within the meaning of the
Code and for state Tax law purposes (except in those states that do not
recognize S corporation status) at all times since inception, and has filed
all forms and taken all actions necessary to maintain such status. None
of the shares of the Companys capital stock has ever been owned by a Person
who was not a permissible shareholder pursuant to Section 1361(b)(1) of the

or similar provision of applicable Law in connection with the deemed sale of

indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII, such Purchaser Indemnified
Party shall notify the Escrow Agent and the Seller Representative of such
claim promptly but in any event within thirty (30) days after it becomes aware
of such Third Party Claim, specifying the nature of such Third Party Claim and
the amount or estimated amount thereof, together with copies of all notices
and documents (including court papers) served on or received by such Purchaser
Indemnified Party; provided that the failure to provide such notice within
such thirty (30) day period shall not affect the rights of such Purchaser
Indemnified Parties to indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII except to
the extent that the Seller Representative or any Seller shall have been
materially prejudiced thereby.

 

(b) If the Third Party Claim may result in a claim against the Escrow Account,
the Seller Representative shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such
Purchaser Indemnified Party notice of a given Third Party Claim to elect, at
its option, to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, in which case:
(i) the attorneys fees, other professionals and experts fees and court or
arbitration costs incurred by the Seller Representative in connection with
defending such Third Party Claim shall be payable from the Escrow Account or
if all amounts in the Escrow Account have been distributed, directly by the
Sellers; (ii) the Purchaser Indemnified

 



39  Party shall be entitled to participate in, but not determine or conduct, the
defense of such Third Party Claim and shall be entitled to be indemnified for
any costs or expenses incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim; (iii) the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall make available to the Seller Representative all
books, records and other documents and materials that are under the direct or
indirect control of the Purchaser, any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates
and that the Seller Representative considers necessary or desirable for the
defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
herein shall require any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to take any
action that could reasonably be expected to result in the loss or waiver of
the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other similar
privilege; (iv) the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall execute such
documents and take such other actions as the Seller Representative may
reasonably request for the purpose of facilitating the defense of, or any
settlement, compromise or adjustment relating to, such Third Party Claim; (v)
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall otherwise fully cooperate as
reasonably requested by the Seller Representative in the defense of such Third
Party Claim; (vi) the Seller Representative shall not enter into any
agreement providing for the settlement or compromise of such Third Party Claim
or the consent to the entry of a judgment with respect to such Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and (vii) as a condition to
assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Sellers agree and
acknowledge that all Losses incurred or sustained by a Purchaser Indemnified
Party as a result of such Third Party Claim shall be deemed indemnifiable
Losses for all purposes under this Agreement.

(c) If the Seller Representative elects not to defend such Third Party Claim,
then (i) the Purchaser shall conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim,
(ii) the Seller Representative shall be entitled to participate in, but not
determine or conduct, the defense of such Third Party Claim, (iii) the Seller
Representative shall execute such documents and take such other actions as the
Purchaser may reasonably request for the purpose of facilitating the defense
of, or any settlement, compromise or adjustment relating to, such Third Party
Claim, (iv) the Seller Representative shall otherwise fully cooperate as
reasonably requested by the Purchaser in the defense of such Third Party
Claim, and (v) the Purchaser shall not enter into any agreement providing for
the settlement or compromise of such Third Party Claim or the consent to the
entry of a judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Seller Representative (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, all Contests shall be controlled exclusively
in accordance with Section 9.2(a).

Section 8.3 _Limitations on Indemnification of Purchaser_. The
indemnification obligations of the Sellers under this Agreement shall be
subject to the following limitations, except with respect to claims for fraud
and intentional breach, with respect to which this Section 8.3 shall
not apply:

(a) Sellers shall be obligated to pay amounts for indemnification for Losses
arising under Section 8.1(a) only if Purchaser notifies the Seller
Representative thereof on or prior to 11:59 pm Eastern Time on the Expiration
Date, except for claims from breaches of the representations and warranties
set forth in Sections 3.1 (Existence and Power), 3.2 (Government

 



40  Authorization), 3.6 (Capitalization), 3.9 (Taxes), 3.19 (Brokerage), 4.1
(Power and Authority), 4.3 (Title), and 4.9 (Brokerage) (each a " _Seller
Specified Representation_ ") as to which Purchaser shall notify the Seller
Representative thereof on or before the date which is sixty (60) days
following the expiration of the period of legal statutory limitations
applicable to the Losses in question. Purchaser and Sellers hereby agree and
acknowledge that so long as the notice referred to in this Section 8.3(a) is
provided on or prior to the expiration of the relevant time period, the
indemnified partys rights to pursue indemnification for the applicable
representation or warranty shall continue to survive until such matter is
resolved.

(b) The Sellers shall not be obligated to pay any amounts for indemnification
for Losses arising under Section 8.1(a), except those based upon, arising out
of or otherwise in respect of, the Seller Specified Representations and the
matter set forth on  _Schedule 3.7_, until the aggregate amount of Losses
subject to indemnification under Section 8.1(a) from and after the Closing,
equals One Million Eight Hundred Seventy-Five Thousand and 00/100 Dollars
($1,875,000.00), whereupon the Sellers shall be obligated to pay all Losses
which a Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to recover under Section
8.1(a) hereof.

(c) The Sellers shall not be obligated to make any payment for indemnification
for Losses arising under Section 8.1(a), except those based upon, arising out
of or otherwise in respect of the Seller Specified Representations, in excess
of Twenty-Five Million Dollars and 00/100 ($25,000,000.00).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in determining
the liability of a Seller under this Article VIII, such Sellers
indemnification liability for any Losses shall be limited to such Sellers
Allocable Portion of such Losses (which for any Losses based upon, arising
out of or otherwise in respect of a breach by such Seller of his
representations or warranties contained in Article IV or covenants contained
in Article X shall be 100% of such Losses). In no event shall any Seller
be liable (i) for an amount which exceeds the total amount of the Purchase
Price actually received by such Seller (including any adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.7) notwithstanding anything contained
herein or (ii) to pay any amounts in cash, or immediately available funds,
which exceed the amount of cash, or immediately available funds, actually
received by such Seller pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement for
the sale of such Sellers Purchased Shares.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Purchaser
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification and no Seller
Indemnifying Party shall be liable (i) for any special, indirect,
consequential, exemplary or punitive damages or any damages associated with
any lost profits, lost opportunities or claims for diminution in value
incurred or sustained for by a Purchaser Indemnified Party (unless such
Purchaser Indemnified Party has paid, or is obligated to pay, such damages in
connection with a Third Party Claim) or (ii) any failure of Purchaser, the
Company or any of their Affiliates to receive any actual or anticipated Tax
benefit as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby, including but not
limited to any Tax benefit with respect to the Company and the
Purchasers Section 338(h)(10) Election.

 



41 Section 8.4 _Limitations on Indemnification and Covenants of the Sellers_. The
amount of any Losses for which any Seller Indemnifying Party is liable under
this Article VIII shall be net of (a) any amounts actually received by a
Purchaser Indemnified Party under insurance policies with respect to such
Losses, (b) any amounts actually recovered from any other Person with respect
to the matters relating to such Losses and (c) any net Tax benefit actually
recognized by a Purchaser Indemnified Party (taking into account, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Tax detriment, such as a reduction in Tax basis or an
item of income), to the extent such benefit arises from and in the same
taxable year as the incurrence or payment of any such Losses. If the amount to
be netted from any indemnifiable Losses under this Section 8.4 is received by
any Purchaser Indemnified Party after such indemnified party has received
payment from any indemnifying party with respect to such Losses, such
Purchaser Indemnified Party shall pay to the indemnifying party (or in the
case of multiple indemnifying parties such parties, pro rata based on the
amount of the payment received from such indemnifying parties for such Losses)
an aggregate amount equal to the amount such indemnifying party would not have
been required to pay such indemnified party pursuant to this Section 8.4 had
such payment been received or determination been made prior to the
indemnification payment made for such Losses. Each Purchaser Indemnified Party
entitled to receive indemnification for any Loss shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to recover, all or any portion of, such Loss under
insurance policies of the Company which are in effect as of the date hereof.

 

Section 8.5 _Satisfaction of Claims_.

(a) Payment for any indemnifiable Losses suffered by any Purchaser Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Article VIII shall be made pursuant to this Section 8.5
when either (i) the Seller Indemnifying Party (which with respect to a claim
against Sellers other than a breach of a representation or warranty under
Article IV or covenant under Article X shall be the Seller Representative) and
the Purchaser Indemnified Party agree on the amount of such indemnifiable
Losses or (ii) the amount of indemnifiable Losses is finally adjudicated
(each, a " _Final Resolution_ ").

(b) The Sellers agree and acknowledge that the Escrow Amount is intended to
provide Purchaser the ability to satisfy the several obligations of the
Sellers hereunder, whether such indemnification amounts are payable by one or
all of the Sellers. Within ten (10) Business Days after Final Resolution of
any indemnification claim for Losses by any Purchaser Indemnified Party under
this Article VIII pursuant to which such Purchaser Indemnified Party is
entitled to any payment:

(i) If, pursuant to Section 5(f) of the Escrow Agreement, there are
funds available in the Escrow Account to satisfy such Losses, the Seller
Representative and Purchaser shall execute and cause a joint written direction
to be delivered to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (a "
_Joint Direction_ "), which Joint Direction shall direct the Escrow Agent to
make such payment out of the Escrow Account; or

(ii) If such Losses are based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of
Section 8.1(a) resulting from a breach of any Seller Specified Representation
or Sections 8.1(b) or 8.1(c) and the funds available in the Escrow Account to
satisfy such Losses have been exhausted or otherwise released in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement, each Seller shall pay to the applicable

 



42  Purchaser Indemnified Party, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the amount such Seller is required to indemnify such Purchaser
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VIII with respect to such Losses
which is not satisfied pursuant to Section 8.5(a)(i).

Section 8.6 _Seller Representative_. 

(a) Donald Leeper, shall be constituted and appointed as the Seller
Representative for and on behalf of the Sellers. The Seller Representative
may be removed upon the written election of the Sellers holding a majority of
the Purchased Shares immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that a
replacement of the Seller Representative shall in each such case be promptly
elected by the Sellers holding a majority of the Purchased Shares immediately
prior to the Closing Date and the Purchaser is given prompt written notice of
such replacement. The Seller Representative, including any replacement of
any such Seller Representative, is hereby constituted and appointed to act on
behalf of each Seller to give and receive notices and communications, and
indemnification by the Sellers under this Agreement in satisfaction of claims
by a Purchaser Indemnified Party, to object to such deliveries, to agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration
and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to
such claims, to agree to, negotiate, enter into and provide amendments and
supplements to and waivers in respect of this Agreement, in accordance with
Section 11.7 of this Agreement, and to take all actions necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Seller Representative for the
accomplishment of any or all of the foregoing. No bond shall be required of
the Seller Representative, and the Seller Representative shall receive no
compensation for his services. Notices or communications to or from
the Seller Representative shall constitute notice to or from each of the
Sellers.

(b) The Seller Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as Seller Representative while acting in good faith and in the
exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the
advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The
Sellers shall jointly and severally indemnify the Seller Representative and
hold him harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without
gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Seller Representative and
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his
duties hereunder.

Section 8.7 _Actions of the Seller Representative_. Except as specifically
described herein, a decision, act, consent or instruction of the Seller
Representative shall constitute a decision of all of the Sellers and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon each and every Seller, and Purchaser and
the Escrow Agent may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Seller Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction
of each and every Seller. Purchaser, Escrow Agent and the Company are each
hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Seller
Representative.

Section 8.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. The parties each acknowledge and agree that,
except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the indemnification
provisions in this Article VIII shall be the exclusive remedy of any
Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to claims made after the Closing that
relate to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing in this
Section 8.8 shall limit any Person right to pursue injunctive relief for
breach of any covenant or agreement contained herein or to seek any remedy on
account of intentional breach or fraud by any other Person.

 



43 ARTICLE IX

_TAX MATTERS_

Section 9.1 _Pre-Closing Tax Periods_.

 

(a) The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared and shall timely file or
cause to be timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Company required to be filed
on or after the date hereof and on or prior to the Closing Date. Sellers shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed
all income Tax Returns for the Company for all periods ending on or prior to
the Closing Date that are required to be filed after the Closing Date with
respect to which the items of income, gain, loss, deduction and other Tax
items pass through to the Sellers. The Company and Sellers shall permit
Purchaser to review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the
preceding sentences during a reasonable period prior to filing and shall
consider in good faith Purchasers reasonable comments. To the extent required
or permitted by applicable law, Sellers shall include any income, gain, loss,
deduction or other tax items for such periods on their Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the Schedule K-1s prepared by Sellers for such periods. Except
as set forth in this Section 9.1, Purchaser will prepare and file or cause to
be prepared and filed all Tax Returns of or with respect to the Company
required to be filed after the Closing Date.

(b) Subject to Section 8.3(e)(ii) and the Tax Adjustment, except to the extent
included as liabilities in the final determination of Closing Working Capital,
the Sellers shall be solely responsible for and shall indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties against any and all Taxes of the Sellers for any taxable
period or portion thereof and any and all Taxes of the Company attributable to
any taxable period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date
(the " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ ") and all related Losses, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the costs of preparing and filing any Tax Returns (other
than any non-income Tax Returns that are timely filed by the Company in the
ordinary course of business) and conducting any Contest relating to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, but (i) excluding the cost of participating in any Contest
which is being controlled by the Sellers and (ii) any Taxes resulting from
the Section 338(h)(10) Election (other than Taxes resulting from the
application, if any, of Section 1374 of the Code or the installment method of
reporting gain). For the avoidance of doubt, any employment or payroll
taxes with respect to any bonuses, severance, exercise or cash-out of options
or other compensatory payments in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be treated as arising in the Pre-Closing
Tax Period.

 

(c) To the extent that the party responsible pursuant to this Agreement for
filing a Tax Return (the " _Filing Party_ ") is required to remit any Taxes
that the other party is responsible pursuant to this Agreement to pay (the "
_Paying Party_ "), the Paying Party shall pay to the Filing Party any such
Taxes within ten (10) days after receipt of reasonably satisfactory evidence
of the amount of such Taxes. In the case of any taxable period that includes
but does not end on the Closing Date (each, a " _Straddle Period_ "), the
real, personal and intangible 

 



44  property Taxes (" _Property Taxes_ ") imposed upon the Company allocable to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes
for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period; and the Taxes (other than Property Taxes) imposed upon the
Company allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if such
taxable period ended on the Closing Date, provided, that exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including
depreciation and amortization deductions), other than with respect to property
placed in service after the Closing, shall be allocated between the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the
number of days in each period.

Section 9.2 _Tax Audits and Contests; Cooperation_.

 

(a) After the Closing Date, Sellers, through the Seller Representative, shall
control the conduct, through counsel of the Sellers own choosing and at
their own expense, of any Contest involving any income Tax Return of the
Company for any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date. The Seller
Representative and Purchaser shall promptly forward to each other any and
all claims, threatened claims, and related documentation relative to any
actual or potential Contest and shall keep each other reasonably informed with
respect thereto. Purchaser may, at its own expense, participate in any such
Contest controlled by the Sellers (including retaining separate counsel) if,
in Purchasers reasonable judgment, the resolution of such Contest could
adversely affect Purchaser or its Affiliates including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any Contest that could increase the Tax liability of the Company for
any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and, in such case, the
Sellers, through the Seller Representative, shall consult with Purchaser
regarding all material strategic decisions with respect to such Contest and
shall not enter into any agreement providing for the settlement or compromise
of such Contest or consent to the entry of a judgment with respect to such
Contest without Purchasers prior written consent, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Purchaser shall control the
conduct of all other Contests with respect to the Company; _provided __,_
_however_ , to the extent such Contest may result in a claim for
indemnification against the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement, the Seller
Representative shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in, but not
to determine or conduct, the defense of such Contest, and Purchaser shall not
enter into any agreement providing for the settlement or compromise of such
Contest or consent to the entry of a judgment with respect to such Contest
without the prior written consent of the Seller Representative (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(b) The Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers and Purchaser agree to
furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information (including access to books and records) and
assistance relating to the Company and its assets, transactions, and other
business activities, as is reasonably requested for the filing of any Tax
Returns and the preparation, prosecution, defense or conduct of any Contest.
The Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers and Purchaser shall
reasonably cooperate with each other in the conduct of any Contest and each
shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are
necessary to carry out the intent of this Section 9.2(b). Any information
obtained under this Section 9.2(b) shall be kept confidential, except as may
be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in the
conduct of a Contest or other Tax proceeding.

 



45 (c) Purchaser shall cause the Company to (a) use its reasonable efforts to
properly retain and maintain the tax and accounting records of the Company
that relate to Pre-Closing Tax Periods for seven (7) years, (b) transfer such
records to the Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers upon its written
request prior to any such destruction, abandonment or disposition and (c)
allow the Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers and their affiliates
and their respective agents and representatives, at times and dates reasonably
and mutually acceptable to the parties, to from time to time inspect and
review such records as the Sellers may deem necessary or appropriate;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in all cases, such activities are to be
conducted during normal business hours and at the Sellers sole expense. Any
information obtained under this Section 9.2(c) shall be kept confidential,
except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns or in the conduct of a Contest or other Tax proceeding. 

Section 9.3 _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

 

(a) In Purchasers sole discretion, the Company and the Sellers shall join
with Purchaser in making an election under Code Section 338(h)(10) (and any
corresponding election under state, local, and non-U.S. tax law) with respect
to the sale of the Purchased Shares hereunder (collectively, a " _Section
338(h)(10) Election_"). Sellers shall include any income, gain, loss,
deduction or other tax item resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election on
their Tax Returns to the extent required by applicable law. As a condition to
Sellers making the Section 338(h)(10) Election, Purchaser shall pay to
Sellers, in cash, the amount of additional consideration necessary to cause
each Sellers aggregate after-Tax net proceeds from the sale of the Common
Stock with the Section 338(h)(10) Election to be equal to the
aggregate after-Tax net proceeds that such Seller would have received had the
Section 338(h)(10) Election not been made, taking into account all appropriate
state, federal, and local Tax implications, including the taxability of
additional amounts received (the " _Tax Adjustment_ "). In making such
calculations, the actual federal and state tax rates to which Sellers are
subject shall be used. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tax Adjustment shall
not include any Taxes resulting from the application, if any, of Section 1374
of the Code or the installment method of reporting gain. Any disputes over the
Tax Adjustment shall be referred for timely resolution to the Accounting Firm.
The costs of the Accounting Firm shall be borne as set forth in Section
2.7(c). The determination of the Accounting Firm with respect to the disputed
items shall be conclusive and binding on Purchaser and the Sellers. The amount
of the Tax Adjustment shall be paid to Sellers as additional Purchase Price
pro rata based on their share ownership no later than the date the Section
338(h)(10) Election for U.S. federal income tax purposes is filed.

 

(b) In the event that Purchaser determines to make the Section 338(h)(10)
Election, Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers at least sixty (60) days
prior to the due date for making the Section 338(h)(10) Election (the " _Due
Date_ "), copies of Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 and any similar forms
under applicable state, local and foreign income Tax law (collectively, the "
_Forms_ ") properly completed to the extent pertaining to Purchaser and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Forms shall be properly
completed by the Sellers to the extent pertaining to the Sellers, and shall
be duly executed by each Seller and an

 



46  authorized person for Purchaser within thirty (30) days after delivery by
Purchaser (" _Delivery_ "). In the event that Purchaser determines to make the
338(h)(10) Election, Purchaser shall duly and timely file the Forms as
prescribed by Treasury Regulations Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 or the corresponding
provisions of applicable state, local or foreign income Tax law.

 

(c) In the event that Purchaser determines to make the Section 338(h)(10)
Election, at least sixty (60) days prior to the Due Date, Purchaser shall
provide the Seller Representative with a draft of Internal Revenue Service
Form 8883. Such Form 8883 shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
principles and methodologies set forth on _Schedule 9.3(c)_ and the
requirements of Section 338 and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. The Seller Representative shall review such Form 8883 and provide
any proposed revisions to Purchaser within fifteen (15) days after Delivery.
Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall negotiate in good faith with
respect to such proposed revisions and attempt to resolve any differences
between the parties. If Purchaser and the Seller Representative are unable to
reach agreement with respect to such Form 8883 within forty-five (45) days
after Delivery, any disputed items shall be referred for timely resolution to
the Accounting Firm. The costs of the Accounting Firm shall be borne as set
forth in Section 2.7(c). The determination of the Accounting Firm with
respect to the disputed items shall be conclusive and binding on Purchaser and
the Sellers. If a Tax Return is required by applicable law to be filed or a
payment made before the Accounting Firm has resolved the disputed items
(taking into account valid extensions of time within which to file, which
shall be sought to the extent necessary to permit the resolution of disputed
items), the Tax Return shall be filed or payment made as determined by
Purchaser, and shall be amended if necessary to reflect the determination of
the Accounting Firm with respect to the disputed items. The Form 8883,
including all information that has been agreed to or finally determined by the
Accounting Firm shall be referred to as the "Final Allocation." Each of
Purchaser, the Company and the Sellers shall prepare and timely file all Tax
Returns consistent with, and shall not take any Tax position inconsistent
with, the Final Allocation.

 

(d) In the event that Purchaser determines to make the Section 338(h)(10)
Election, Sellers shall provide Purchaser with a preliminary schedule
computing the amount of the Tax Adjustment within thirty (30) days after
Delivery of the Form 8883, based on Purchasers proposed draft of such Form
8883 and Seller Representatives proposed revisions to such Form 8883 in
accordance with Section 9.3(c), which shall be updated as of the date of the
determination of the Final Allocation of the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 9.3(c), whether as agreed by Sellers and Purchaser or as determined by
the Accounting Firm. If there is an adjustment with respect to any Tax Return
of the Company resulting from any audit or other proceeding by any
Governmental Authority that establishes that the Tax Adjustment should have
been more or less than the amount initially determined pursuant to Section
9.3(a), then the difference shall be promptly paid, as the case may be, by
Purchaser to Sellers as additional Purchase Price pro rata based on each
Sellers share ownership, or by Sellers to Purchaser as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

Section 9.4 _Conveyance Taxes_. Sellers shall be responsible for and shall
pay all sales, use, value added, transfer, stamp, registration, goods and
services, documentary, excise, real property transfer or gains, or similar
Taxes incurred as a result of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall be responsible for
and shall pay any

such Taxes incurred as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Election. Sellers
and Purchaser agree to jointly prepare and (where applicable) file all
required change of ownership and similar statements.

 



47 Section 9.5 _Survival_. The covenants and obligations set forth in this
Article IX shall survive until the date that is sixty (60) days following the
expiration of the period of legal statutory limitations applicable to the
Losses in question (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension
thereof).

Trade Secrets and confidential information of the Company; (d) the agreements
contained in this Article X are essential to protect the business and
goodwill of the Company; and (e) Purchaser would not purchase the Purchased

severally and not jointly, as follows:

 

(a) _Non-Compete_. For a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date

business as existing or under development on the date hereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , such Seller may own, directly or indirectly, solely as an
investment, securities of any business traded on any national securities
exchange if such Seller is not a controlling person of, or a member of a group
which controls, such person and does not, directly or indirectly, own 1% or
more of any class of securities of such person.

 

(b) _Confidential Information; Personal Relationships_. Each Seller promises
and agrees that during the Restricted Period, and solely with respect to
Trade Secrets at any time after the Restricted Period, such Seller will not
disclose to any person not employed by the Company or not engaged to render
services to the Company, and that such Seller will not use for the benefit of
such Seller or others, any Confidential Information or Trade Secrets of the
Company obtained by such Seller while such Seller was a stockholder of the

contractor to the Company.

 



48 (c) _Non-Solicitation_. During the Restricted Period, each Seller covenants
and agrees to not, directly or indirectly: (i) induce or attempt to induce
any employee of the Company to leave the employ of the Company or hire any
current employee of the Company, current or former shareholder of the Company,
or former employee of the Company (unless such former employee has ceased to
be employed by the Company for more than one year prior to Closing); or (ii)
induce or attempt to induce any Company customer, supplier, licensee, licensor
or franchisee of the Company to cease doing business with the Company.

Section 10.2 _Rights and Remedies Upon Breach_. If any Seller breaches, or
threatens to commit a breach of, any of the provisions of Section 10.1 (the "
_Restrictive Covenants_ "), Purchaser and the Company shall have the right to
have the Restrictive Covenants specifically enforced by any court of
competent jurisdiction, it being agreed that any breach or threatened breach
of the Restrictive Covenants may cause irreparable injury to Purchaser and the
Company and that money damages may not provide an adequate remedy to Purchaser
and the Company. 

Section 10.3 _Severability of Covenants_. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees
that as to such Seller, the Restrictive Covenants are reasonable and valid in
geographical and temporal scope and in all other respects. If any court
determines that any of the Restrictive Covenants, or any part thereof, is
invalid or unenforceable as to the Sellers or to any Seller, the remainder of
the Restrictive Covenants shall not thereby be affected and shall be given
full effect as to the Sellers or such Seller, without regard to the invalid
portions.

Section 10.4 _Blue-Penciling_. If any court determines that any of the
Restrictive Covenants, or any part thereof, is unenforceable as to the Sellers
or to any Seller because of the duration or geographic scope of such
provision, such court shall have the power to reduce the duration or scope of
such provision, as the case may be, as to the Sellers or such Seller, and, in
its reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable. 

ARTICLE XI

_MISCELLANEOUS_

Section 11.1 _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto each agree (a) to
consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making
any public statement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) to provide to the other party for review a copy of any such
press release or public statement and (c) to not issue any such press release
or make any such public statement prior to such consultation and review and,
unless such issuance is required by applicable Requirements of Law or
the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, the receipt of the prior consent of the
other Parties.

Section 11.2 _Expenses_. Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the
other hand, will each be responsible for their own transaction fees and
expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of legal counsel,
accountants, investment bankers, brokers or other representatives or
consultants) in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Transaction Expenses_ "), whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated. For the avoidance of doubt,
any Transaction Expenses incurred by the Company shall be the responsibility
of the Sellers, and any Transaction Expenses incurred by the

 



49  Company that have not been paid by the Sellers as of the Closing shall be
deemed to be Debt for purposes of payment of the Purchase Price; provided,
however, that the fees incurred in connection with the restatement of the
Required Financials shall be deemed Transaction Expenses of the Purchaser and
therefore not considered Debt.

Section 11.3 _Treatment of Indemnity Payment_. It is the intention of the
parties to treat any indemnity payment made under this Agreement as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for all federal, state, local and foreign
Tax purposes, and the parties agree to file their Tax Returns accordingly
except as otherwise required by applicable Requirements of Law.

Section 11.4 _Interpretation_. Any statute, regulation, or other law defined
or referred to herein (or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to
