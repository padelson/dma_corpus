This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this _"Agreement"_ ) is made and entered

_"Parent"_ ), VTRP MERGER SUB, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a
subsidiary of Parent ( _"Merger Sub"_ ), and PROVIDENT SENIOR LIVING TRUST, a
Maryland real estate investment trust (the _"Company"_ ).



R E C I T A L S:



WHEREAS, the board of directors of Parent and the board of trustees of the
Company deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective
equityholders for Parent and the Company to combine their businesses by the
merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (the " _Merger_ ");



WHEREAS, immediately prior to the Merger, Merger Sub and the Company shall
execute a Certificate of Merger in substantially the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ (the " _Delaware Certificate of Merger_ ") and shall file such
certificate in accordance with Delaware law to effectuate the Merger;



WHEREAS, immediately prior to the Merger, Merger Sub and the Company shall
execute Articles of Merger in substantially the form attached hereto as 
_Exhibit B_ (the " _Maryland Certificate of Merger_ " and, together with the
Delaware Certificate of Merger, the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") and shall
file such articles in accordance with Maryland law to effectuate the Merger;



WHEREAS all the holders of an aggregate of 430,250 common units of limited
partner interests (together with any units issued after the date hereof in
accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_ , the " _LTIP Units_ ") in PSLT OP, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership (" _Company OP_ "), issued pursuant to the
Companys long term incentive plan (the " _LTIP_ ") have entered into an
agreement with Parent in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (each, an
_"OP Agreement"_ ), pursuant to which such holders have agreed to contribute
their LTIP Units to Parent OP (as defined below) in exchange for the OP
Consideration (as defined below) in accordance with _Section 2.2_ ; and



WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the
Merger.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the mutual covenants and
agreements contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto,
intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:



 

\- 1 - ARTICLE I.



 

THE MERGER



Section 1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware Limited
Liability Company Act (the " _DLLCA_ ") and Title 8 of the Corporations and
Associations Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland (" _Title 8_ " and,
together with the DLLCA, " _Entity Law_ "), at the Effective Time, the
Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub as the
surviving entity (the " _Surviving Entity_ ") and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent. Merger Sub and the Company are collectively referred to as the "
_Constituent Entities_." If immediately prior to the Closing Date the cash
component of the Merger Consideration (as defined below) is 55% or more of the
Merger Consideration (determined by taking into account the value as of the
day immediately prior to the Closing Date (as defined below) of the shares of
Parent Common Stock (as defined below) to be issued in the Merger), then, at
the sole election of Parent, the Merger shall for purposes of this Agreement
be a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company with the Company as the
Surviving Entity.



Section 1.2. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on the first Business Day after
satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions set forth in _Article VII_
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing), unless another time and date are agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto (the " _Closing Date_ "). The Closing shall take place at the offices
of Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP, 787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019,
unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. "
_Business Day_ " shall mean any day, other than a Saturday, Sunday or other
day on which banks are required or permitted to close in the City and State of
New York.



Section 1.3. Effective Time. As soon as practicable following the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ , Merger Sub and the
Company shall file the Certificate of Merger in accordance with Entity Law,
and shall make any other filings and recordings required under Entity Law. The
Merger shall become effective (the " _Effective Time_ ") on the Closing Date
at such time as the Certificate of Merger is accepted for record in accordance
with Entity Law (or at such later date and time as may be specified in the
Certificate of Merger). The Merger shall have the effects specified in
this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of
Entity Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to
the terms of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, all the respective
properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Constituent
Entities shall vest in the Surviving Entity, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of the Constituent Entities shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Entity. At the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
Parent OP to issue the OP Consideration as provided in _Section 2.2_.



Section 1.4. Constituent Documents. The constituent documents of Merger Sub in
effect at the Effective Time shall be the constituent documents of the
Surviving Entity.



 

\- 2 - Section 1.5. Officers and Managers.



(a) The officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall become the initial
officers of the Surviving Entity as of the Effective Time, to hold office in
accordance with the constituent documents of the Surviving Entity until their
successors are duly appointed and qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal.



(b) The managers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall become the initial
managers of the Surviving Entity as of the Effective Time, to hold office in
accordance with the constituent documents of the Surviving Entity until their
successors are duly elected and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal.



Section 1.6. Status of Merger Sub. At the option of Parent, Merger Sub may be
a limited liability company that is owned by Parent or one or more
subsidiaries of Parent, so long as (i) Merger Sub is a "disregarded entity"

retired and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor.



(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ ) shall be converted

per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") and (ii) an amount in cash

other rights to acquire shares of Company Common Stock, Company LP Units or
LTIP Units, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, shares of
Company Common Stock, Company LP Units or LTIP Units.



(d) _Termination of Rights of Company Common Stock_. As of the Effective Time
all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each

outstanding Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of
any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares or readjustment, then the Merger Consideration issuable or payable to
the holders of Company Common Stock shall be adjusted accordingly, without
duplication, to provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic
consideration as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.



Section 2.2. Operating Partnership Contribution.



(a) _Exchange of LTIP Units_. Each holder of a LTIP Unit issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall have the right (the
" _OP Contribution_ ") to contribute each LTIP Unit held by such

exchange for 0.8022 units of a new class of limited partnership interest in
Parent OP (a " _Parent OP Unit_ ") to be created by Parent OP prior to the
Effective Time having the terms set forth in such holders OP Agreement (the "
_OP Consideration_ ") pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement
and such holders OP Agreement.



(b) _Unit Splits, Etc_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the

to such event.



(c) _Parent OP and Company OP Action_. Parent and the Company shall take, and
shall cause Parent OP and Company OP to take, all action necessary in order
for the holders of any vested or unvested LTIP Units to participate in the OP
Contribution and to exchange all of their LTIP Units (whether vested or
unvested) for the OP Consideration, including executing an amendment to the
Parent OP limited partnership agreement creating the OP Consideration with the
specific terms set forth in the OP Agreements in a form mutually satisfactory
to Parent and the Company (the " _Class D Amendment_ "). The parties hereto
agree that the Company and Company OP may issue to its officers and employees
up to an additional 331,250 LTIP Units prior to the Effective Time which units
shall be converted into shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Parent shall cause Parent OP to take all necessary action
to reflect on its books and records the issuance of the OP Consideration to
each holder of an LTIP Unit who elects to receive OP Consideration. 



(d) _Delivery of Proxy Statement/Prospectus_. Parent and the Company shall
mail the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as defined below) to each holder of a
LTIP Unit at the same time that the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is mailed to
the holders of Company Common Stock. 



Section 2.3. Exchange of Company Common Stock. 



(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select U.S.
Bank National Association or another bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as exchange and paying agent (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the Exchange Agent certificates
representing Parent Common Stock and cash sufficient to pay the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ (such Parent Common Stock and
cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "), it being
understood that any and all interest earned on funds made available to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be for the account of and
paid to Parent.



(b) _Exchange Procedures for Holders of Company Common Stock_.



(i) Each holder of an outstanding Certificate or Certificates who has
surrendered such Certificate or Certificates to the Exchange Agent will, upon
acceptance thereof by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive (x) a
certificate or certificates representing the number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock into which the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate or Certificates surrendered shall
have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, (y) the amount of cash into
which the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented  



 

\- 5 -  by such Certificate or Certificates surrendered shall have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement and (z) the right to receive any other distribution
paid with respect to shares of Company Common Stock prior to the Effective
Time, in each case without interest. The Exchange Agent shall accept such
Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal exchange practices. Each outstanding Certificate that prior to the
Effective Time represented Company Common Stock and which is not surrendered
to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the procedures provided for herein
shall, except as otherwise herein provided, until duly surrendered to the
Exchange Agent, be deemed to evidence the right to receive the Merger
Consideration into which such Company Common Stock shall have been converted.
After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of
the Company or the Surviving Entity of Certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock and if such Certificates are presented to the Company
for transfer, they shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger
Consideration. No dividends on Parent Common Stock that have been declared
with a record date after the Effective Time will be remitted to any holder of
Company Common Stock entitled to receive Parent Common Stock under this
Agreement until such holder surrenders the Certificate or Certificates
representing Company Common Stock, at which time such dividends shall be
remitted to such holder, without interest.



(ii) Appropriate transmittal materials in a form satisfactory to Parent and
the Company (including a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificate shall pass, only
upon delivery of such Certificate to the Exchange Agent) and certain tax
forms related to tax withholding shall be mailed as soon as practicable after
the Effective Time to each holder of Company Common Stock. Parent shall not be
obligated to deliver cash and/or a certificate or certificates
representing Parent Common Stock to which a holder of Company Common Stock
would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder
surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing the shares of Company
Common Stock for exchange as provided in this _Section 2.3_ , or, in default
thereof, an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a
bond as may be reasonably required by Parent or the Exchange Agent. If any
certificates evidencing Parent Common Stock are to be issued in a name other
than that in which the Certificate evidencing Company Common Stock surrendered
in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate from the Certificate
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other tax required by
reason of the issuance of a certificate for Parent Common Stock in any name
other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax
has been paid or is not payable. 



 

\- 6 - (c) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof determined in accordance
with this _Article II_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or the Exchange
Agent may require the delivery of a reasonable indemnity or bond against any
claim that may be made against the Surviving Entity with respect to such
Certificate or ownership thereof.



(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim
for the Merger Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may cause
the Surviving Entity to pay any such claim for the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration.



(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to six years
after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of
any Governmental Agency (as defined below)), any such cash in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of the Surviving Entity, free and clear of all claims or interest of
any person previously entitled thereto.



(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis in
overnight bank deposits, bankers acceptances or other deposits available for
withdrawal on demand at any commercial bank that is a member of the Federal
Reserve System having combined capital and surplus of not less than
$500 million. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to Parent.



(g) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any holder of Company Common Stock or LTIP Units pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent
are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ "), or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority by Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock or LTIP Units in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Entity
or the Exchange Agent.



 

\- 7 - (h) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for a fractional share of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of Company Common
Stock who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Company Common Stock
delivered by such holder) shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without
interest) in an amount determined by multiplying (1) the fractional share
interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by (2) the average
per share closing price of Parent Common Stock as reported on the New York
Stock Exchange (the _"NYSE"_ ) Composite Transactions reporting system (as
published in The Wall Street Journal or, if not published therein, in
another authoritative source mutually selected by the Company and Parent) for
the 10 trading days ending two days prior to the Closing Date. No such holder
shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect
of any fractional share other than as provided in the preceding sentence.

Company has previously delivered or made available to Parent true and complete

trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which is or has ever been
treated as a single employer with any Group Member under Section 414(b), (c),
(m) or (o) of the Code (" _ERISA Affiliate_ ") has incurred any liability due
to a complete or partial withdrawal from a Multiemployer Plan or due to the
termination or reorganization of a Multiemployer Plan, except for any such
liability which has been satisfied in full, and no events have occurred and no
circumstances exist that would be expected to result in any such Liability to
any Group Member or ERISA Affiliate.



(d) None of the Employee Plans is a single-employer plan, as defined in
Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, that is subject to Title IV of ERISA (" _Title
IV Plan_ "), and no Group Member or ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained a
Title IV Plan or a plan subject to Section 412 of the Code. No

employees is appropriate for collective bargaining. No union or other labor
organization has been certified as bargaining representative for any of the

in all material respects. Such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in
all material respects. The Company has established in its books and records

\- 58 - ARTICLE VIII.



EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND POST-CLOSING COVENANTS



Section 8.1. Employee Plans and Other Employee Arrangements. After the
Effective Time, all Persons employed by the Company shall, at the option of
Parent, either continue to be eligible to participate in the Employee Plans
then maintained by the Company or be eligible to participate in the same
manner as other similarly situated employees of Parent in any "employee
benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, sponsored or maintained by
Parent for similarly situated employees after the Effective Time. With respect
to each such employee benefit plan, service with the Company shall
be included only for purposes of determining eligibility to participate,
vesting and, other than under any defined benefit pension plan, accrual and
entitlement to benefits. With respect to medical benefits provided by Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary on and after the Closing Date, coverage that would
otherwise be denied due to a preexisting illness or evidence of insurability
shall be provided by Parent to those Persons who had such coverage under a
plan sponsored by the Company before the Closing Date, and in the plan year
including the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by Parents insurance
carriers or required by applicable Legal Requirements, credit shall be given
to any such Person for any co-payments, deductibles or out of pocket expenses
paid or incurred by such Person under such a plan during the portion of the
relevant plan year preceding the Effective Time. Nothing contained in this
_Section 8.1_ shall be deemed to obligate Parent, the Company or
their respective Subsidiaries to continue the employment or benefits with
respect to any Person employed by the Company as of the Effective Time or for
any period of time thereafter. Nothing herein shall limit the ability of
Parent to amend or terminate any employee benefit plan sponsored or
maintained by Parent at any time hereafter, or the ability of the Company
after the Effective Time to amend or terminate any Employee Plan. Parent shall
pay, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to assume and pay, at the Effective
Time, all severance obligations of the Company as set forth in _Section
3.14(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter_.



Section 8.2. Indemnification of Company Officers and Trustees.



(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Entity to, provide exculpation and indemnification
for each person who is now or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or
who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director or trustee of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") which
is the same as the exculpation and indemnification provided to the Indemnified
Parties by the Company (including advancement of expenses, if so provided) in
the Company Organizational Documents and the "Indemnification Agreements" (as
defined in and attached as _Section 3.18(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter_
), as in effect at the close of business on the date hereof, which exculpation
and indemnification shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who
were, at any time prior to the Effective Time, directors, trustees, officers
or employees of the Company; _provided_ , that such exculpation and
indemnification covers actions on or prior to the Effective Time, including
all transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



 

\- 59 - (b) The Surviving Entity shall obtain and maintain in effect at the Effective
Time and continuing until the sixth anniversary thereof "run-off" directors
and officers liability insurance with a coverage amount and other terms and
conditions comparable to the Companys current trustees and officers liability
insurance policy covering the directors and officers of the Company with
respect to their service as such prior to the Effective Time (but without any
exclusion for liabilities under federal and state securities laws); _provided_
, _however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Entity be required to
expend more than $450,000 in the aggregate to obtain and maintain insurance
coverage pursuant hereto for such six-year period, in which case the Surviving
Entity shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage on comparable terms that
provides the maximum coverage that is then available for such six-year period
for $450,000 in the aggregate.



(c) The provisions of this _Section 8.2_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
his or her personal representatives and shall be binding on all successors and
assigns of Parent, the Surviving Entity and the Company. Parent agrees to pay
all costs and expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel) that may be
incurred by any Indemnified Party or his or her heirs or his or her personal
representatives in successfully enforcing the indemnity or other obligations
of Parent under this _Section 8.2_. The provisions of this _Section 8.2_
shall survive the Merger and are in addition to any other rights to which an
Indemnified Party may be entitled.



(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective
successors or assigns transfers all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then the transferee shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 8.2_ , which obligations are expressly intended to be
for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified
Party covered hereby.



Section 8.3. Further Assurances. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, or to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise establish in
the Surviving Entity full right, title and interest in, to or under any of
the assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company
and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the Surviving Entity are fully
authorized in the name and on behalf of each of the Constituent Entities or
otherwise to take all such lawful and reasonably necessary or desirable
action.

enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, and such Order shall have
become final and non-appealable;  _provided_ that in such case the
terminating party is not in material breach of its representations,

breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this
Agreement in any manner that shall have caused or resulted in the failure to
consummate the Merger on or before such date;



(e) by Parent, if (i) the Board shall have withdrawn or materially modified
its recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger in a manner adverse to
Parent or its shareholders or shall have resolved to do so (an " _Adverse
Recommendation_ "), unless such action by the Board results from a Parent
Material Adverse Effect (solely for purposes of determining whether a
Termination Fee (as defined below) is owed under Section 9.3(c)(i), a "Parent

Material Adverse Effect"_ ) if (x) the price per share of Parent Common Stock

(y) the average price of the publicly-traded healthcare REITS set forth in the
weekly sector scorecard of Stifel, Nicolaus and Company, Incorporated (excluding
Parent) has not decreased more than 16.5% during the same period, and (z)
such decrease in the price per share of Parent Common Stock results in the
withdrawal by the Company Financial Adviser of its opinion described in
_Section 3.26_ ); (ii) the Company shall fail to call or hold the Company
Shareholders Meeting in accordance with _Section 6.1_ ; (iii) the Company
shall have intentionally and materially breached any of its obligations under

\- 61 - (f) by the Company, if prior to the approval of this Agreement at the
Company Shareholders Meeting the Board shall have approved, and the Company
shall concurrently enter into, a definitive agreement providing for the
implementation of a Superior Acquisition Proposal, but only if (i) the Company
is not then in breach of  _Section 6.6_ , and (ii) concurrently with such
termination the Company shall have made payment of the full amounts required
by _Section 9.3_ ;



(g) by Parent, if there shall have been a breach of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company contained

(30) days following written notice to the Company; or



(h) by the Company, if there shall have been a breach of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Parent or Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in _Sections

within thirty (30) days following written notice to Parent.



Section 9.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Parent or the Company, as provided in _Section 9.1_ , this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and of no further force and effect
without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, except as provided in _Section 5.3(c)_ , _Sections 9.2_ , _9.3_ ,
_10.2_ , _10.3_ , _10.4_ , and _10.6_ through _10.13_ , which provisions

shall relieve any party from any liability for any breach by a party of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.



Section 9.3. Fees and Expenses.  



(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) below, whether or not
the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
paid by the party incurring such expenses (including brokers or finders
fees and the expenses of its representatives).



(b) If any of the conditions set forth in paragraph (c) below are satisfied,
then the Company shall, subject to and in accordance with such paragraph, pay

\- 62 - (c) The Company shall pay the Termination Fee and the Parent Expense
Reimbursement (or the portion thereof described below) to Parent (provided
that the Company was not entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1(h)_ ) as follows:



(i) if Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of _Section
9.1(e)_ (unless a Deemed Parent Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred)
or if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of
_Section 9.1(f)_ or if either party terminates this Agreement at a time when
Parent had the right to terminate pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ , the Company
shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee and the Parent Expense Reimbursement,
which payment shall be made concurrent with any such termination by the
Company and on the same day as any such termination by Parent; or



(ii) if an Acquisition Proposal is publicly disclosed, or otherwise becomes
known to the Companys shareholders, after the date hereof, and thereafter
Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ ,
and within twelve (12) months following such termination, the Company enters
into a definitive agreement providing for, or consummates, an Acquisition
Proposal (whether or not such Acquisition Proposal is the same Acquisition
Proposal which had been received or publicly disclosed at the time of
termination of this Agreement), the Company shall, concurrent with
consummating such transaction, pay to Parent the Termination Fee and the
Parent Expense Reimbursement; or



(iii) if an Acquisition Proposal is publicly disclosed, or otherwise becomes
known to the Companys shareholders, after the date hereof, and thereafter
Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d)
(but only if the Company is then in material breach of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement in any manner that
shall have caused or resulted in the failure to consummate the Merger on or
before the Termination Date), and within twelve (12) months following such
termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for, or
consummates, an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not such Acquisition Proposal
is the same Acquisition Proposal which had been received or publicly disclosed
at the time of termination of this Agreement), the Company shall, concurrent
with consummating such transaction, pay to Parent the Termination Fee and the
Parent Expense Reimbursement.



(d) " _Termination Fee_ " shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i)
$13,000,000 (the " _Maximum Termination Fee_ ") and (ii) the sum of (A) the
maximum amount that can be paid to Parent without causing it to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if
the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections
856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), as determined
by independent accountants to Parent, and (B) in the event Parent receives a
letter from outside counsel (the " _Termination Fee Tax Opinion_ ")
indicating that Parents receipt of the Maximum Termination Fee would either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the
meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the " _REIT Requirements_
") or that the receipt by Parent of the excess of the Maximum Termination Fee
over the amount payable in _clause (A)_ following the receipt of such opinion
would not be deemed  



 

\- 63 -  constructively received prior thereto, the Maximum Termination Fee less the
amount payable under _clause (A)_ above. In the event that Parent is not able
to receive the Maximum Termination Fee, the Company shall place the unpaid
amount in escrow and shall not release any portion thereof to Parent unless
and until the Company receives, from time to time, any one or combination of
the following: (i) a letter from Parents independent accountants indicating
the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to Parent without causing
Parent to fail to meet the REIT Requirements or (ii) a Termination Fee Tax
Opinion indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to as
Qualifying Income, as gross income that is excluded under the REIT
Requirements or as amounts not constructively received prior to such time, in
either of which events the Company shall pay to Parent the lesser of the
unpaid Maximum Termination Fee or the maximum amount stated in the letter
referred to in (i) above or the opinion referred to in (ii) above.



(e) The " _Parent Expense Reimbursement_ " shall be an amount equal to the
lesser of (i) Parents reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including all attorneys, accountants, consultants and investment
bankers fees and expenses and all financing and commitment fees), not to
exceed $5,000,000, and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid
to Parent without causing it to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did
not constitute Qualifying Income, as determined by independent accountants to
Parent, and (B) in the event Parent receives a Termination Fee Tax Opinion
indicating that Parents receipt of the Parent Expense Reimbursement would
either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income
within the meaning of the REIT Requirements or that receipt by Parent of the
excess of the Parent Expense Reimbursement over the amount payable under 
_clause (A)_ following the receipt of such opinion would not be deemed
constructively received prior thereto, the Parent Expense Reimbursement less
the amount payable under _clause (A)_ above. In the event that Parent is not
able to receive the full Parent Expense Reimbursement, the Company shall pay
Parent the unpaid amount within two (2) Business Days after receipt, from time
to time, of any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from
Parents independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be
paid at that time to Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet the REIT
Requirements or (ii) a Termination Fee Tax Opinion indicating the maximum
amount that can be paid at that time to Parent as Qualifying Income, as gross
income that is excluded under the REIT Requirements or as amounts not
constructively received prior to such time, in either of which events the
Company shall pay to Parent the lesser of the unpaid Parent
Expense Reimbursement or the maximum amount stated in the letter referred to
in (i) above or the opinion referred to in (ii) above.



(f) The payment of the Termination Fee and the Parent Expense Reimbursement
shall be compensation and liquidated damages for the loss suffered by Parent
as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated and to avoid the
difficulty of determining damages under the circumstances, and does not
constitute a penalty. The Termination Fee or the Parent Expense
Reimbursement shall not be deemed  



 

\- 64 -  to constitute the measure of damages suffered by Parent in any instance in
which the payment of the Termination Fee or Parent Expense Reimbursement is
not provided for under the terms of this Agreement. Subject to _Section 10.9_
and excluding damages arising out of any breach by a party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, neither party shall have any other liability to the other after
the payment thereof.



(g) The Companys obligation to pay any unpaid portion of the Termination Fee
or the Parent Expense Reimbursement shall terminate three (3) years from the
date of this Agreement, provided the Companys obligation to pay any amounts
under this _Section 9.3_ shall have accrued within the applicable time period
set forth in this _Section 9.3_.
