(ii) other than in the case of a Company Holder who is subject to U.S.
federal income tax with respect to the receipt of any portion of the
Shareholder Earnout Payment in respect of Unvested Company Options that are

Unvested Company Option that is referred to in subsection (a)(ii)(y)(B) above
shall be paid out to the holder thereof in accordance with the vesting

the information provided by Parent, the Stockholders Agent shall calculate
the allocation of such forfeited amount, and Parent shall make the payments of
such forfeited amount to the remaining Earnout Holders within ten (10)
Business Days after delivery of such calculation to Parent.

(c) _Calculation of Earnout Amounts; Dispute Resolution_. As soon
as reasonably practicable following the completion of the audit of each
Measurement Period but not later than sixty (60) days after the expiration of
such Measurement Period, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholders
Agent a consolidated schedule of revenue of the Division for the Measurement
Period (the " _Consolidated Earnout Revenue Statements_ ") along with a
statement setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of: (i) if such
Measurement Period is the Base Period, Base Period Revenue; and (ii)  if such
Measurement Period is the Earnout Period, Actual Earnout Revenue, Earnout
Revenue and the Shareholder Earnout Payment (if any) (the " _Earnout
Calculation Statement_ "). Parent shall afford to the Stockholders Agent and
its advisors and representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice after delivery of Consolidated Earnout
Revenue Statements and the Earnout Calculation Statement to the books
of account and records used to prepare the Consolidated Earnout Revenue
Statements and the Earnout Calculation Statement, and to management of the
Division for purposes of verifying the calculation of the Shareholder Earnout
Payment. The Stockholders Agent shall notify Parent in writing within twenty
(20) Business Days of receipt of both the Consolidated Earnout Revenue
Statements for the Earnout Period and the Earnout Calculation Statement as to
whether the Stockholders Agent disputes the determination of the Shareholder
Earnout Payment, setting forth in reasonable detail the specific items in
dispute and the basis for the dispute (an " _Earnout Dispute Notice_ "). If
the Stockholders Agent does not deliver an Earnout Dispute Notice within
twenty (20) Business Days of receipt of both the Consolidated Earnout Revenue
Statements for the Earnout Period and the Earnout Calculation Statement, or
if the Stockholders Agent accepts the amounts set forth in the Consolidated
Earnout Revenue Statements for the Earnout Period and the Earnout Calculation
Statement in writing, the Shareholder Earnout Payment calculations
as contained in the Earnout Calculation Statement shall be deemed final

 and binding. In the event an Earnout Dispute Notice is delivered, (i) the
undisputed portion of the Shareholder Earnout Payment shall be deemed final
and binding and Parent shall pay the undisputed portion of the Shareholder
Earnout Payment to the Earnout Holders within ten (10) Business Days of the
delivery of the Earnout Dispute Notice and (ii) Parent and the Stockholders
Agent (or the designated representative of the Stockholders Agent) shall
meet within ten (10) Business Days of the delivery of such Earnout Dispute
Notice to attempt to resolve such dispute in good faith. If a final resolution
of such dispute is reached as reflected in an agreement in writing, the
agreed upon Shareholder Earnout Payment shall be deemed final and binding. If
no final resolution is reached within fifteen (15) Business Days of the
delivery of such Earnout Dispute Notice after good faith negotiation, either
party may require that the dispute (other than a dispute as to the calculation
of any aspect of the Earnout Calculation Statement) be resolved in accordance
with the dispute resolution mechanism set forth in  _Section 9.3_;
_provided, however_ , that if the dispute relates to the method of calculation
of any aspect of the Earnout Calculation Statement, the dispute shall be
submitted to an independent accounting firm of recognized national standing
mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Stockholders Agent (the " _Earnout
Arbitrator_ ") if the dispute relates to the calculation of any aspect of the
Earnout Calculation Statement. The Earnout Arbitrator shall be authorized
only to arbitrate the calculation of Actual Earnout Revenue and Base Period
Revenue, but shall not have any authority to arbitrate any other dispute
relating to the matters addressed in this  _Section 1.8_. The Earnout
Arbitrator shall be instructed to review the Consolidated Earnout Revenue
Statements, the Earnout Calculation Statement, the Earnout Dispute Notice and
all work papers related thereto to determine Actual Earnout Revenue or the
Base Period Revenue, as the case may be, and use every reasonable effort to
determine such amounts within sixty (60) days after the submission of such
dispute to it, and in any event, as soon as practicable. The
Earnout Arbitrator shall not undertake any review of any matters not
specifically identified by the Stockholders Agent as being in dispute in the
Earnout Dispute Notice and shall only decide the specific items under dispute
by the parties and solely in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In
resolving any disputed item, the Earnout Arbitrator may not assign a value to
any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party
or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The
Earnout Arbitrators determination shall be based solely on presentations by
Parent and the Stockholders Agent and an independent review by the Earnout
Arbitrator of the books and records of Parent and on the definitions and
other terms included herein. The Earnout Arbitrator shall set out the
resolution of the dispute in writing, which shall be conclusive and binding
upon the parties. The costs and expenses of the Earnout Arbitrator shall be
borne (i) by Parent if the difference between the Shareholder Earnout Payment
as determined by Parent and as determined by the Earnout Arbitrator is greater
than the difference between the Shareholder Earnout Payment as determined by
the Stockholders Agent and as determined by the Earnout Arbitrator or (ii)
by the Company Holders (to be allocated among them on the basis of each
Holders Proportionate Indemnification Share) if the difference between the
Shareholder Earnout Payment as determined by Parent and as determined by the
Earnout Arbitrator is lower than the difference between the Shareholder
Earnout Payment as determined by the Stockholders Agent and as determined by
the Earnout Arbitrator, or (iii) 50% by the Parent and 50% by the Company
Holders (to be allocated among them on the basis of each Holders
Proportionate Indemnification Share), in any other case.

262 of Delaware Law.

 

(i) Subject to clause (ii) of this _Section 1.9(c)_, notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Dissenting Shares shall not be
converted as provided in _Section 1.9(a)_, but the holder thereof shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by Delaware Law.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (i) of this _Section 1.9(c)_,
if any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock who demands appraisal of
such holders shares of Company Capital Stock under Delaware Law effectively
withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders
right to appraisal, then as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such
event, whichever later occurs, such holders shares of Company Capital Stock
shall automatically be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration plus, subject to  _Section 1.8_, the Per Share
Shareholder Earnout Amount (in each case, without interest) with respect to
shares of Company Common Stock owned by such holder (including shares of
Company Common Stock into which any shares of Company Preferred Stock are
converted or deemed converted in accordance with _Section 1.9(a)(ii))_
subject to any escrow, withholding or indemnification contemplated by this
Agreement, as provided in _Section 1.9(a)_, upon surrender of the Company
Certificates representing such Company Capital Stock pursuant to _Section
1.11_.

(iii) The Company shall give Parent (x) prompt notice of any written demands
for appraisal or payment of the fair value of any shares of Company Capital
Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served on the
Company pursuant to Delaware Law relating to the Merger, and (y) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for appraisal under Delaware Law or the Legal Requirements of any other
applicable jurisdiction. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the
Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or settle, or offer to settle, any such demands. Following the
Effective Time, Parent shall give the Stockholders Agent (x) prompt notice
of any written demands for appraisal or payment of the fair value of any
shares of Company Capital Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served on Parent pursuant to Delaware Law relating to the Merger,
and (y) the

 



12 ##### Table of Contents

  

 opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under Delaware Law or the Legal Requirements of any
other applicable jurisdiction. Following the Effective Time, except with the
prior written consent of the Stockholders Agent, neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or settle, or offer to settle, any such demands.

(d) _Cancellation of Certain Company Capital Stock_. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all shares of Company Capital
Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and
shall not be taken into account for purposes of any amounts payable to the
Company Holders hereunder.

Section 1.10 _Company Options and Company Warrants_.

(a) _Unvested Company Options_. Unvested Company Options shall not be
accelerated at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time and which is unvested and not exercisable for
Company Common Stock as of immediately before the Effective Time (each an "
_Unvested Company Option_ ") shall be assumed by Parent and shall convert into
that number of Parent Options equal to (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, each with an exercise price
applicable to the Parent Option (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal
to the per share exercise price applicable to the Unvested Company Option as
of immediately before the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio;
_provided, however_ , that in no case shall the exchange of a Company Option
be performed in a manner that is not in compliance with the adjustment
requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Each such Parent Option shall be
subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including but not limited to any
vesting or exercisability provisions applicable to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time (and, in the case of Unvested Company
Options that are subject to the provisions of Section 102 of the Ordinance,
to all rights and obligations that may be imposed under the Interim Option
Ruling or the Israeli Options Tax Ruling, as applicable), other than any such
vesting provision which would otherwise have caused an acceleration of
vesting or exercisability upon the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) [Reserved].

(c) _Vested Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company
Option that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time and which is vested and exercisable as of immediately before
the Effective Time (each a " _Vested Company Option_ ") shall be cancelled in
exchange for the right to receive, subject to any escrow, withholding or
indemnification contemplated in this Agreement, a cash payment from Parent (I)
as soon as practicable following the Effective Time to the holder thereof
equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which
such option is vested and exercisable as of immediately before the Effective
Time multiplied by the excess of (1) the Per Share Merger Consideration, over
(2) the per share exercise price for such option and

 



13 ##### Table of Contents

  

 (II) at the time set forth in _Section 1.8_ (subject to the terms and
conditions of _Section 1.8_) to the holder thereof equal to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which such option is vested
and exercisable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
the per Share Shareholder Earnout Amount less, with respect to any vested
Company Option for which the exercise price thereof exceeded the Per Share
Merger Consideration, the excess of such exercise price over the Per Share
Merger Consideration. On and after the Effective Time the Vested Company
Options shall terminate and cease to be outstanding.

 

(d) _Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each Company Warrant that is
unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time
and which is vested and exercisable as of immediately before the Effective
Time shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive, subject to any
escrow, withholding, or indemnification contemplated in this Agreement and
subject to compliance with _Section 1.11(c)_, a cash payment from Parent to
the holder thereof (I) at the Effective Time, equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock into which all shares of Preferred Stock issuable
upon exercise of such Company Warrant are convertible in accordance with the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company multiplied by the excess of (1)
the Per Share Merger Consideration, over (2) the product of (A) the exercise
price per share of Preferred Stock for which such Company Warrant is
exercisable multiplied by (B) the Conversion Ratio applicable to such shares
of Preferred Stock, and (II) at the time set forth in _Section 1.8_ (subject
to the terms and conditions of _Section 1.8_), equal to the number of shares
of Company Common Stock into which all Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise
of such Company Warrant are convertible in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company multiplied by the Per Share Shareholder Earnout
Amount. Neither the Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall assume any Company
Warrant that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
or not then exercisable. Following the Effective Time, no Company Warrants
shall be outstanding and any Company Warrants outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be null and void and shall not be exercisable for the
securities of the Company, the Surviving corporation, the Parent or any other
Person.

(e) _Israeli Option Tax Ruling_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
execution of this Agreement, the Company shall instruct its Israeli counsel,
advisors and accountants, in coordination with Parent, to prepare and file
with the Israel Tax Authority an application for a ruling in relation to
options granted to Israeli employees and consultants of Wintegra Ltd. which
will provide, among other things, that: (i) the payments made in respect to
Vested Company Options will not constitute a violation of Section 102 of the
Israeli Income Tax Ordinance [New Version] 1961 (" _Section 102_ " and the "
_Ordinance_ ," respectively) as long as such payment is deposited with the
trustee who is holding or controlling such Vested Company Options (the " _102
Trustee_ "), and is released only after the lapse of the minimum trust period
required by Section 102 of the Ordinance (the " _102 Trust Period_ "); (ii)
the assumption of the Unvested Company Options will not result in a taxable
event with respect to such Company Options pursuant to Section 3(i) or Section
102 of the Ordinance, and with respect to such Company Options subject to
Section 102 that tax continuity shall apply including with regard to the
requisite holding period which will be deemed to have begun at the time of the
grant of Company Options and with regard to the classification of the gain;
(iii) Parent and anyone acting on its behalf shall be exempt from withholding
tax in relation to any payments made to the 102 Trustee (which ruling may be
subject to customary conditions regularly associated with such a

 



14 ##### Table of Contents

  

 ruling); and (iv) that the Escrow Amount in respect of the Vested Company
Options and Company shares held by the trustee shall not be subject to Israeli
Tax until actually received by the appropriate Company Holders (the "
_Israeli Options Tax Ruling_ "). Each of the Company and Parent shall cause
their respective Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants to coordinate all
activities, and to cooperate with each other, with respect to the preparation
and filing of such application and the preparation of any written or oral
submissions that may be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Israeli
Options Tax Ruling. If the Israeli Options Tax Ruling is not granted prior to
Closing, the Company shall seek to receive prior to the Closing an interim tax
ruling confirming that Parent and anyone acting on its behalf shall be exempt
from Israeli withholding tax in relation to any payments made to the 102
Trustee (the " _Interim Option Ruling_ "). In the event that the Israeli
Options Tax Ruling has not been received by the Closing, Parent shall delay
the assumption of the Unvested Company Options of Israeli holders until
receipt of either the Israeli Options Tax Ruling or a separate confirmation
from the Israeli Tax Authority that such assumption will not constitute a tax
event in Israel. In the event that the Israeli Options Tax Ruling or such
other separate confirmation has not been received within 180 days of the
Closing, unless otherwise instructed by the Israel Tax Authority, Parent will
assume the Unvested Company Options as provided above and shall withhold any
amount that may be required under law.

(f) The Company shall take all steps necessary prior to the Effective Time to
cause the Company Options and Company Warrants to be treated as set forth in
this _Section 1.10_ and in _Section 1.8_, including providing any necessary
notices and obtaining any necessary consents or waivers. Copies of the
relevant agreements governing all Company Options and Company Warrants have
been made available to Parent.

 

Section 1.11 _Surrender of Certificates and Payment_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. U.S. Bank, N.A. (or its successor in interest or other
institution selected by Parent with the reasonable consent of the Company)
shall act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") in the Merger.

(b) _Parent to Provide Cash_. At the Closing, Parent shall deliver to the
Paying Agent for exchange and payment in accordance with this _ARTICLE I_ , an
aggregate amount of cash equal to the Initial Amount less an amount equal to
the product of (x) the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by (y) the
number of shares of Common Stock subject to Unvested Company Options, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ that _,_ in the case of
payments to employees or former employees of the Company for which Tax
withholding is required, such payments may be made through the Companys or
Parents payroll processing service or system. 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates representing Company Capital Stock or Company
Warrants, as the case may be (each such certificate, a " _Company Certificate_
"), whose Company Capital Stock or Company Warrants are converted into the
right to receive the merger consideration, a letter of transmittal and
instructions to the letter of transmittal for use in effecting the surrender
of the Company Certificates in exchange for the merger consideration. Upon
surrender of all Company Certificates held by a Company Holder for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other

 



15 ##### Table of Contents

  

 agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto in respect of such Company Certificates, the Company
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled and, subject to
_Section 1.15_, the holder of such Company Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor payment of cash in an amount equal to, (I) with
respect to any company Common Stock, (1) the product of (A) the Per Share
Merger Consideration and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock held
by such holder (including the number of shares of Company Common Stock into
which all remaining shares of Company Preferred Stock held by such holder)
(the " _Cash Consideration_ "), less (2) an amount equal to the product of (Y)
the Per Share Escrow Amount plus the Per Share Expense Amount and (Z) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder (including the
number of shares of Company Common Stock into which all remaining shares of
Company Preferred Stock held by such holder immediately prior to the
Effective Time were converted pursuant to _Section 1.9(a)(ii)_); and (II)
with respect to any Company Warrants, (1) the product of (X) the excess of (i)
the Per Share Merger Consideration minus (ii) the product of (A) the exercise
price per share of Preferred Stock for which such Company Warrant is
exercisable multiplied by (B) the Conversion Ratio applicable to such shares
of Preferred Stock multiplied by (Y) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock into which all Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company
Warrant, represented by the Company Certificate so surrendered are convertible
in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, less (2)
an amount equal to the product of (Y) the sum of the Per Share Escrow Amount
and Per Share Expense Amount multiplied by (Z) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock into which all Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of such
Company Warrant, represented by the Company Certificate, are convertible in
accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company. Until so
surrendered, each outstanding Company Certificate that, prior to the
Effective Time, represented Company Capital Stock will be deemed from and
after the Effective Time, for all purposes, to evidence solely the right to
receive a portion of the merger consideration in accordance with _Section
1.9(a)_.

 

(d) _Conversion Schedule_. No later than three (3) Business Day prior to the
expected Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a schedule (the "
_Final Conversion Schedule_ ") showing (i) for each Company Holder, as of the
Closing Date: (A) the number and class of shares of Company Capital Stock
held, (B) the number of shares and class of shares of Company Capital Stock
subject to each Company Option, the exercise price per share, the exercise or
vesting schedules thereof, and whether such Company Holder is an employee of
the Company, (C) the number and class of shares of Company Capital Stock
subject to each Company Warrant held, the exercise price per share, the number
of shares of Company Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company
Warrant in accordance with  _Section 1.10(d)_ hereof, and the Conversion
Ratio applicable to any Preferred Stock issuable on exercise of such Company
Warrant, (D) a calculation of the amount payable to such Company Holder on the
Effective Date (I) pursuant to _Sections 1.9(a)_ and _1.10_ in respect of
shares of Company Capital Stock, and (II) pursuant to _Section 1.10(c)_ in
respect of Vested Company Options, (E) the number of Parent Options issuable
to each holder of Unvested Company Options, and (F) such Company Holders
Proportionate Indemnification Share of the Escrow Amount (assuming no claims
for Damages pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_ ), (ii) an updated good faith itemized
estimate of Company Fees and Expenses at the Closing (together with
reasonable backup documentation in connection therewith) and (iii) an updated
good faith itemized estimate of Indebtedness of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries at the Closing. An officer of the 

 



16 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Company shall certify that the Final Conversion Schedule correctly reflects
the calculations required to be made pursuant to this Agreement, and the
Company shall deliver the Final Conversion Schedule together with such
certification to Parent at or prior to Closing.

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any merger consideration is to be
distributed to a name other than that in which the Company Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Company Certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of payment in
cash to any name other than that of the registered holder of the Company
Certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any
agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
1.11_, none of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party
hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Legal Requirements.

 

(g) _Return of Merger Consideration_. Any merger consideration made available
to the Paying Agent and not exchanged for Company Certificates in accordance
with this _Section 1.11_ within six (6) months after the Effective Time shall
be redelivered or repaid by the Paying Agent to Parent, after which time any
holder of Company Certificates who has not theretofore delivered or
surrendered such Company Certificates to the Paying Agent, subject to
applicable Legal Requirements, shall look as a general creditor only to Parent
for payment of the merger consideration. If any Company Certificates are not
surrendered prior to the earlier of the second anniversary of the Effective
Time and such time as the unclaimed merger consideration payable in exchange
therefor would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity, such unclaimed merger consideration shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 

Section 1.12 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock; No
Interest_.

and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of any
shares of Company Capital Stock on the records of the Company. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Company Certificates evidencing ownership
of shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Legal
Requirements. If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates are presented
to Parent or the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _ARTICLE I_. Payments due under
this _ARTICLE I_ shall be made without interest.

 

Section 1.13 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_.

 

In the event that any Company Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, Parent shall cause to be paid in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Company

 



17 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, such payment of the merger consideration as may be required pursuant
to this _ARTICLE I_ ; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates to deliver a bond
in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the
Company Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Section 1.14 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_.

If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, the
officers and directors of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation
are fully authorized in the name of their respective entities or otherwise to
take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such
action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

 

Section 1.15 _Tax Withholding_.

 

(a) Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Escrow Agent
and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Initial Merger Consideration payable hereunder, or other
payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement,
including for the avoidance of doubt any payments made in accordance with 
_Section 1.10(e)_ above, the amounts required to be deducted and withheld
under the Code, or any provision of any U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S.
Tax law. Any amounts so withheld shall be paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Entity. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld,
such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to, and actually received by, such holder in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

(b) Without derogating from the foregoing provisions of _Section 1.15(a)_
above, (i) with respect to any withholding under a Legal Requirement of the
State of Israel with respect to Company Options, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agent, as the case may
be and when applicable, shall act in accordance with the Interim Option
Ruling or the Israeli Options Tax Ruling, in each case if obtained, _provided_
that such ruling determines the withholding process in respect of such
payment, (ii) in the case of a payment other than with respect to Company
Options made to a Company Holder, if such Company Holder provides to the
Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, and the Escrow
Agent, to its full satisfaction, together with the documents specified in
_Section 1.11(c)_, any of (A) a valid certificate of exemption from
withholding Tax issued by the Israel Tax Authority and applicable to such
Company Holder; (B) a valid ruling, interim ruling or written
confirmation issued by the Israel Tax Authority that provides for a specific
rate of withholding applicable to such Company Holder; (C) a valid tax ruling,
interim ruling or written confirmation issued by the Israel Tax Authority that
determines the treatment of payments to be made to Company Stockholders under
this Agreement (the " _Withholding Tax Ruling_ "), or (D) an interim tax

payments to be made to Company Stockholders under this Agreement or providing
an exemption from withholding (the " _Interim Withholding Tax Ruling_ "),
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving 

 



18 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Corporation, the Escrow Agent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall
withhold any amounts pursuant to such valid certificate or valid ruling issued
by the Israel Tax Authority. The parties confirm their understanding of the
applicable Legal Requirement that, unless otherwise explicitly required by the
Israel Tax Authority, no Israeli tax withholding shall apply to, or shall be
made with respect to, any amounts of the Initial Merger Consideration (other
than in respect of the Unvested Company Options) solely by virtue of delivery
of such amounts by or on behalf of Parent to the Paying Agent.

Section 1.16 _Transfer Taxes_.

All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and such other
Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) imposed on any Company
Holder or other Person entitled to receive merger consideration pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement shall be borne and paid by such Company Holder or
Person.

business and, in jurisdictions where such concept is recognized, is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership, leasing or use of its
properties and assets, or the conduct of its business, makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified and in
good standing would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Company

nonassessable. Each Company Subsidiary has the requisite corporate power to
own its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted and is
duly qualified to do business and, in jurisdictions where such concept is
recognized, is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership,
leasing or use of its

 properties and assets, or the conduct of its business, makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified and in

made available to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of the governing
documents of each Company Subsidiary, each as amended to date. None of the

Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the state of Delaware. Merger Sub is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state
of Delaware. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the corporate power to own its
properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted and is
duly qualified to do business and, in jurisdictions where such concept is
recognized, is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the failure to
be so qualified and in good standing would have a material adverse effect on
the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub are not in violation of
any of the provisions of their respective certificate of incorporation or
bylaws.

 

Section 3.2 _Authority_.

 

Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which

been

 



54 ##### Table of Contents

  

 duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub, as the case may be, and no other corporate action on the part of
Parent or Merger Sub is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by
Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which
either of them is a party and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement
to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party have been duly executed and delivered
by Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, and constitute the valid and
binding obligations of Parent or Merger Sub enforceable against Parent
or Merger Sub in accordance with their terms, except to the extent that
enforceability may be limited by the effect, if any, of (i) any applicable
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other Legal Requirements
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally, and (ii) general
principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding at law or in equity. Neither the execution and delivery by
Parent or Merger Sub of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to which it
is a party, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby will conflict with, or result in any breach or violation of, or
default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) or give rise
to a right of termination, cancellation or obligation or loss of any benefit
under (i) any provision of the articles of incorporation, certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) any contract to which
Parent or Merger Sub is a party or to which any of their respective properties
or assets is bound or (iii) subject to the exceptions set forth in the
sentence that immediately follows, any Legal Requirement applicable to either
Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective properties or assets, except,
in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such conflicts, breaches,
violations, defaults, rights or losses, which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, prevent or materially and adversely delay the consummation by
Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Except for the filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger and the
related certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation in
accordance with the requirements of Delaware Law, no notice to, filing with,
and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity,
or any private third party is necessary for the consummation by Parent and
Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 3.3 _Interim Operations of Merger Sub_.

 

Merger Sub was formed by Parent solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement has engaged in no other business
activities and has conducted its operations only as contemplated by this
Agreement. Merger Sub has no liabilities and, except for a subscription
agreement pursuant to which all of its authorized capital stock was issued to
Parent, is not a party to any agreement other than this Agreement, the
agreements contemplated herein and agreements with respect to the appointment
of registered agents and similar matters.

 

Section 3.4 _Legal Proceedings_.

 

As of the date of this Agreement, there is no private or governmental action,
suit, proceeding, inquiry, claim, charge, arbitration or investigation
pending before any Governmental Entity, or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened against Parent or Merger Sub which, if adversely determined, would
prevent Parent or Merger Sub from consummating the Merger. As of the date of
this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub is subject to any judgment,
decree, injunction or order of any court, which would prevent Parent or Merger
Sub from performing

 their respective obligations under this Agreement or consummating the
transactions contemplated hereby.

employees of the Company and to acquire additional information about the
business and financial condition of the Company. Parent is acquiring
the Company Capital Stock for investment and not with a view toward or for
sale in connection with any distribution thereof, or with any present
intention of distributing or selling such shares. Parent agrees that the
Company Capital Stock may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale,
pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration under the

Aggregate Merger Consideration at the times contemplated by this Agreement.

pursuant to Section 802.4 of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976, as amended, and the rules promulgated thereunder (the " _HSR Act_ "),

claims, liabilities or damages resulting from the Company seeking to obtain

Agreement, an " _Action of Divestiture_ " means (i) any license, sale or

shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each employee of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries with credit for all service
with the Company and Company Subsidiaries (and service credited by the

or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay such 2010 Distribution to the
employees of Parent and the Division who were employees of the Company and
Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing and are eligible to the
2010 Distribution, with the allocation of such payment to be as set forth in
_Schedule 5.6(c)_ to be provided by the Division General Manager to Parent as
soon as practicable following the final determination of the 2010

whatsoever shall any of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Division or
any of the Company Subsidiaries have any liability with respect thereto.

former employee (including any dependent thereof) of the Company or the

continued employment for any specific period, nor to require Parent, or the
Surviving Corporation, or any Company Subsidiary to continue any specific

one (1) day prior to the Closing Date, have terminated the Company 401(k) Plan

Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to: (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each individual who served as a director or officer of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "
_Officer Indemnified Parties_ ") to the extent provided for under the terms
and conditions of the Company Certificate of Incorporation or the Company
Bylaws (each as in effect as of the date hereof), in connection with any Claim
(as defined below) and any judgments, fines (including excise taxes),
penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments
and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such
judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement) resulting
therefrom. The indemnification obligations of the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to this _Section 5.9(a)_ shall extend to acts or omissions occurring
at or before the Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto (including
with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and any Claim relating thereto) and all rights to
indemnification conferred hereunder shall continue as to an individual who
has ceased to be a director or officer of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time and shall inure to the benefit of such
individuals heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. As used
in this _Section 5.9(a)_, the term " _Claim_ " means any threatened,
asserted, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, or any inquiry or
investigation, whether instituted by the Company, any Governmental Entity or
any other party, that any Officer Indemnified Party in good faith believes
might lead to the institution of any such action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other, including any

or pertaining to matters that relate to such Officer Indemnified Partys

Disclosure Schedule providing for the indemnification of such Officer
Indemnified Party.

consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, assume all of
the obligations of the Surviving Corporation set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ shall survive the consummation of
the Merger for a period of six (6) years and (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Officer Indemnified Party and

substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any

the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 5.9_ shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Officer
Indemnified Party under this _Section 5.9_ without the consent of such
affected Officer Indemnified Party.

years from the Effective Time the current policies of the directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and set forth in
_Section 5.9_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, covering acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing Date with respect to those persons who are
currently covered by such current policies; _provided_ that (i) Parent or the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of a reputable
insurance company the terms of which are not materially less favorable to
such directors and officers in the aggregate than the insurance coverage
otherwise required under this _Section 5.9(e_); or (ii) purchase a "tail"
policy under the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policy
(the " _tail policy_ "), the terms of which are not materially less favorable
to such directors and officers in the aggregate than the insurance coverage
otherwise required under this  _Section 5.9(e)_. Neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay annual premiums (for the
current policies or any substitute policies) in excess of 150% of the current
annual premium paid by the Company with respect to such current policies
(which amount is set forth in _Section 2.18_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule) (the " _Maximum Premium_ ") and, in the event any future annual
premiums for the current policies (or any substitute policies) exceed the
Maximum Premium, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
reduce the amount of coverage of the current polices (or substitute policies)
to the amount of coverage that can be obtained for a premium equal to the
Maximum Premium.

Section  5.11 _Tax Matters_.

The following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility as
among Parent and the Stockholders Agent for certain Tax matters:

(a) _Filings Prior to Closing Date_. The Company shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns in respect of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are required to be filed (taking
into account any extension granted) on or before the Closing Date, and the
Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, all of its Taxes and the Taxes of each
Company Subsidiary that are due on or before the Closing Date. Such Tax
Returns shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with past practices of the Company with respect to such items,
except as required by any applicable Legal Requirement. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this _Section 5.11_ shall limit the representations made
in  _Section 2.13_ of this Agreement.

(b) _2009 Israeli Income Tax Return_. The Stockholders Agent together with
the Management of the Division shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
timely file or cause to be filed the Israeli income Tax Return of the
Companys Israeli subsidiary for its taxable year ended December 31, 2009
(the " _2009 Israeli Income Tax Return_ "). Management of the Division shall
(A) submit the 2009 Israeli Income Tax Return to Parent for review and comment
at least thirty (30) days prior to its filing and (B) incorporate any timely
comments requested by Parent in good faith, provided such comments are (i)
consistent with past practice and applicable law, and (ii) could not
reasonably be expected to materially adversely impact the Company
Stockholders.

(c) _Other Pre-Closing Tax Period and Straddle Period Tax Returns_. Parent
shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax
Returns for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for any taxable year or
period that ends on or before the Closing Date that are due (including
extensions) after the Closing Date and for any Straddle Period, other than
the 2009 Israeli Income Tax Return. Parent shall (A) submit such Tax Returns
to the Stockholders Agent for review and comment at least thirty (30) days
prior to their filing and (B) incorporate any timely comments requested by
the Stockholders Agent in good faith, provided such comments (i) are
consistent with past practice and applicable law, and (ii) could not
reasonably be expected to materially adversely impact the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or Parent (or any Affiliate) in any taxable year or period
beginning after the Closing Date. In the event that Parent and the
Stockholders Agent are unable to agree on any position(s) taken on any Tax
Return described in this _Section 5.10(c)_ prior to the due date for filing
such Tax Return, Parent and the Stockholders Agent shall promptly submit such
Tax Return to the Tax Arbitrator for resolution in accordance with
the procedures described in _Section 5.11_. In the case of any Straddle
Period, Taxes shall be apportioned as provided in _Section 5.10(d)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, _Article VIII_ , not this _Section 5.10(c)_ , shall
govern any claim for indemnity with respect to Tax Returns described in this
_Section 5.10(c)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent that Parent
does not incorporate a comment provided by the Stockholders Agent that (i)
is consistent with past practice and applicable law and (ii) results in the
imposition of a liability for Tax in excess of the reserve established on the
books and records of the Company in respect of such Tax item, Parent
shall not be entitled to seek indemnification in respect of such additional
Tax liability.

 



69 ##### Table of Contents

  



(d) _Straddle Period_. Where it is necessary for purposes of this Agreement
to apportion the Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or with
respect to the assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for a Straddle
Period, such liability shall be apportioned between the period deemed to end
at the close of the Closing Date, and the period deemed to begin at the
beginning of the day following the Closing Date on the basis of an interim
closing of the books, except that Taxes (such as real or personal property
Taxes) imposed on a periodic basis shall be allocated on a daily basis.

(e) _Tax Contests_. After the Closing Date, Parent shall notify the
Stockholders Agent within thirty (30) days of the commencement of any notice
of Tax deficiency, proposed Tax adjustment, Tax assessment, Tax audit, Tax
examination or other administrative or court proceeding, suit, dispute or
other claim with respect to Taxes (a " _Tax Claim_ ") affecting the Taxes of
or with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary that, if determined
adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of time would be grounds for a
claim for indemnity pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ hereof; _provided, however_ ,
that a failure by Parent to provide notice of a Tax Claim within such thirty
(30) day period shall not entitle the Indemnifying Persons to reduce the
amount of the liability required to be paid pursuant to the Tax Indemnity
under _Section 8.2(a)_ unless such failure results in a material detriment to
the Indemnifying Persons, in which case the amount the Indemnifying Persons
are required to pay with respect to such liability shall only be reduced by
the amount of such detriment. Thereafter, Parent shall deliver to the
Stockholders Agent, as promptly as possible but in no event later than
thirty (30) days after Parents receipt thereof, copies of all relevant
notices and documents (including court papers) received by Parent. In the case
of any Tax Claim relating to any Tax period ending on or before the Closing
Date that, if determined adversely to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
would be grounds for a claim for indemnity pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_
hereof, the Stockholders Agent (at its sole cost and expense) shall have the
right to control the conduct of such Tax Claim and shall have the right to
settle such Tax Claim; _provided, however_ , (i) that Parent may fully
participate in the dispute of such Tax Claim, (ii) the Stockholders Agent
shall not settle, compromise or dispose of any Tax Claim in a manner that
could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Company, any Company
Subsidiary, Parent or its affiliates after the Closing Date, (iii) the
Stockholders Agent shall keep Parent timely informed with respect to the
commencement, status and nature of any such Tax Claim and (iv) the
Stockholders Agent shall not settle, compromise or dispose of any Tax Claim
without the consent of the Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. In the case of any Tax Claim relating to the Taxes of any Straddle
Period, Parent and the Stockholders Agent may each participate, at their own
expense, in the audit or proceeding, and the audit or proceeding shall be
controlled by Parent or the Stockholders Agent, whichever would bear the
burden of the greatest portion of the adjustment; _provided, however_ , that
the party controlling the Straddle Period Tax Claim (i) shall not settle such
audit or proceeding without the consent of the other party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld and (ii) shall keep the other party timely
informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any such
Tax Claim.

(f) _Cooperation_. Parent and the Stockholders Agent shall cooperate fully,
as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection
with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, examination, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other

 proceeding. Each of Parent and the Stockholders Agent agrees, upon request,
to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Tax Authority as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate
any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereunder).

Section 5.12 _Tax Dispute Resolution_.

 

Any dispute, controversy, or claim between Parent, on the one hand, and the
Stockholders Agent, on the other hand, arising out of or relating to the
provisions of this Agreement that relates to Taxes or any Tax Returns that
cannot be resolved by negotiations between Parent and the Stockholders Agent
shall be submitted to a senior tax partner in a mutually agreeable nationally
recognized accounting firm for resolution (" _Tax Arbitrator_ "). The
resolution reached by the Tax Arbitrator shall be binding on the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries, the Stockholders Agent, Parent and their respective
affiliates, and may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction.
The expenses of the Tax Arbitrator shall be borne by Parent and the
Stockholders Agent in such proportions as the Tax Arbitrator considers to be
fair and reasonable in all circumstances to resolve the dispute.

authorization from the Stockholders Agent or from the Stockholders Agent
jointly with Parent to make such delivery, (ii) receipt of written notice of a

8.4(b)_ unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization
from the Stockholders Agent to make such delivery. Parent shall afford to the

privileges (including attorney client privilege)) during normal business hours
and upon reasonable notice during the Dispute Period to the documents, books,
records, data, information, management and employees of Parent as the

Section  8.5 _Stockholders Agent_.

(a) The Company Holders, by approving this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, irrevocably appoint and constitute Concord (K.T.) Venture
Management Ltd. as the Stockholders Agent for and on behalf of the Company
Holders to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and
for all other purposes hereunder and thereunder, to give and receive notices
and communications, to authorize delivery to Parent of the applicable portion
of the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by Parent Indemnified Persons, to
object to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, to agree to, negotiate,
enter into and provide amendments and supplements to and waivers in respect
of this Agreement, in accordance with _Section 7.4_ and _Section 7.5_ of
this Agreement, and the Escrow Agreement, to make and settle determinations
and calculations with respect to distributions and allocations of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration hereunder, including without limitation, the
Shareholder Earnout Amount and amounts to be distributed out of the Escrow
Fund, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Stockholders Agent for the accomplishment of any or all of the foregoing.
Such agency may be changed by the holders of a majority in interest of the
Escrow Fund from time to time upon not less than ten (10) days prior written
notice to all of the Indemnifying Persons and to Parent. No bond shall be
required of the Stockholders Agent, and the Stockholders Agent shall receive
no compensation for his services. Notices or communications to or from the
Stockholders Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the
Indemnifying Persons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholders Agent
shall not be deemed to represent or act on behalf of any Company Holder or
Earnout Holder with respect to the Tax or other individual matters of such
Company Holder, and a notice in this respect to the Stockholders Agent shall
not be deemed to be a notice to such Company Holder.

 

(b) The Stockholders Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as Stockholders Agent while acting in good faith and any act done
or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of
such good faith. The Indemnifying Persons shall severally and pro rata, in
accordance with their respective Proportionate Indemnification
Share, indemnify the Stockholders Agent and hold him harmless against any
loss, liability, expense or fee incurred without gross negligence or bad faith
on the part of the Stockholders Agent and arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder, (the " _Agent
Expenses_ "). At the Closing, Parent shall deposit an amount equal to the
Expense Amount with the Escrow Agent; _provided_ that the Expense Amount
shall be held in a separate account by the Escrow Agent solely for the use of
the Stockholders Agent to pay the Agent Expenses (including, without
limitation, all Agent Expenses arising in connection with claims
for indemnification hereunder) related to the Stockholders Agents actions
taken with respect to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Neither Parent
nor any Parent Indemnified Person shall have any right, title or interest to
the Expense Amount and shall not make any claims against the Expense Amount
under this Agreement or otherwise. The Stockholders Agent may reimburse itself
or any third party for any Agent Expenses from the Expense Amount by delivery
to the Escrow Agent (without a copy to Parent) of written notice specifying
the amount of Agent Expenses to be reimbursed and the name of the payee
thereof. The Stockholders Agent shall not be required to provide to Parent a
copy of any such written notice provided to the Escrow Agent. Following the
termination of the Escrow Period (but not before), the Stockholders Agent
shall have the right to recover any unpaid Agent Expenses from the Escrow Fund
from any amount that would otherwise be 

 



83 ##### Table of Contents

  

 distributed to the Indemnifying Persons and, prior to any such distribution,
shall deliver to the Escrow Agent (with no copy to the Parent) a certificate
setting forth the Agent Expenses actually incurred and not previously
reimbursed. Any amounts remaining in the Expense Amount as of the date of
distribution to the Indemnifying Persons or payment to the Parent Indemnified
Persons of any and all remaining amounts of the Escrow Fund, shall
be released to the Indemnifying Persons in proportion to their respective
Proportionate Indemnification Shares, as instructed in writing by the
Stockholders Agent.

Section 8.6 _Actions of the Stockholders Agent_.

A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders Agent shall
constitute a decision of all of the Company Holders and Earnout Holders and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each and every Company Holder and
Earnout Holder, and the Escrow Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the
Surviving Corporation may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction
of the Stockholders Agent as being the decision, act, consent or instruction
of each and every Company Holder. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby
relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Stockholders Agent. In the event that the Stockholders Agent is not a
natural person, such notice shall name a natural person who shall be the
designee of the Stockholders Agent (the " _Designee_ "). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, if the Stockholders Agent is not a
natural person, then any notice from the Stockholders Agent other than any
notice provided by the Designee of the Stockholders Agent may, in Parents
sole and absolute discretion, be disregarded and shall not constitute notice
for any purpose under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other
related agreement, and each of Parent, Merger Sub, any Escrow Agent, the
Surviving Corporation and each other Parent Indemnified Person may disregard
without liability of any nature whatsoever any notice purported to be provided
by the Stockholders Agent other than any such notice provided by the
Designee of the Stockholders Agent.

Section  8.7 _Third-Party Claims_.

Except as otherwise provided in _Section 5.11(e)_, in the event that Parent
becomes aware of a third-party claim (" _Third Party Claim_ ") which Parent
believes may result in Damages against the Escrow Fund, Parent shall promptly
notify the Stockholders Agent of such Third Party Claim (the " _Third Party
Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to give prompt
notice shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the
extent the Stockholders Agent, on behalf of the Indemnifying Persons, has
been materially and adversely prejudiced as a result of such failure. The
notice of Third Party Claim shall include, based on the information then
available to Parent, a summary in reasonable detail of the basis for the Third
Party Claim and a good faith estimate of the Damages. Parent shall have the
right to assume and control such Third Party Claims (including the control
of litigation or settlement or compromise thereof); _provided, however_ ,
that the Stockholders Agent, on behalf of the Indemnifying Persons, shall, at
its own expense and without recourse to the Escrow Fund, be entitled to
participate in any defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided,_ _further_
that Parent may not effect the settlement of any such claim without the prior
written consent of the Stockholders Agent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) unless such settlement does
not involve (i) the imposition of an injunction or other non-monetary relief
or penalty on an Indemnifying Person or (ii) a finding of liability on the
part of an Indemnifying Person in which

 



84 ##### Table of Contents

  

 case Parent may effect a settlement without the prior written consent of the
Stockholders Agent, however, Parent shall consult with the Stockholders
Agent reasonable time prior to agreeing to such settlement, and the mere fact
that such settlement was entered into shall not be a conclusive evidence that
indemnification hereunder is due. In the event Parent does not assume the
defense of such claim, then and the Parent Indemnified Person shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ
separate counsel of its choice for such purpose. The fees and expenses of such
separate counsel shall be borne by the Parent Indemnified Person unless, in
the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Parent Indemnified Person, (x) there
are or may be substantive legal defenses available to such Parent Indemnified
Person that are different from, or additional to, those available to the
Stockholders Agent, or (y) a conflict of interest may arise between the
positions of a Parent Indemnified Person and the Stockholders Agent in
conducting the defense of any such action that would make separate
representation advisable, in which case, the Parent Indemnified Persons shall
be entitled to select separate counsel to act on their behalf and the fees and
expenses of such separate counsel shall be indemnifiable Damages under this
_Article VIII_ ;  _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the
Indemnifying Persons be required to pay the fees and expenses under this
indemnity for more than one firm of attorneys (in addition to local counsel)
in any jurisdiction in any one legal action or group of related legal
actions. The Stockholders Agent may not effect the settlement of any such
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). 

Section 8.8 _No Right of Contribution_.

 

Neither the Stockholders Agent nor any Company Holder shall make any claim
for contribution from the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Company
Subsidiary with respect to any indemnity claims arising under or in connection
with this Agreement to the extent that the Company, Surviving Corporation or
any Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder for such
claim, and the Stockholders Agent, on its own behalf and on behalf of all
Indemnifying Persons, hereby waives any such right of contribution from the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary it has or may
have in the future.

Section 8.9 _Effect of Investigation; Reliance_.

 

The right to indemnification, payment of Damages or any other remedy will not
be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any Knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect
to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company or any
other matter. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any such
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
such covenant or agreement, will not affect the right to indemnification,
payment of Damages, or any other remedy based on any such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement. No Parent Indemnified Person shall be
required to show reliance on any representation, warranty, certificate or
other agreement in order for such Parent Indemnified Person to be entitled to
indemnification hereunder. Parent and the Company each acknowledge that such
Damages, if any, would relate to unresolved contingencies existing at
the Effective Time, which if resolved at the Effective Time would have led to
a reduction in the Aggregate Merger Consideration that Parent would have paid
in connection with the Merger.
