in all events, precede the Second Effective Time.

 



 

Section 2.04 _Effects of the Mergers_.

 



 

(a) At the First Effective Time, the First Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL and MBCA.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the First Effective Time,
the First Surviving Corporation shall possess all the property, rights,

and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub 1, all as provided under the DGCL and MBCA.

 



 

(b) At the Second Effective Time, the Second Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DLLCA and MBCA.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Second Effective
Time, the Surviving Company shall possess all the property, rights,

and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub 2, all as provided under the DLLCA and MBCA.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.05 _Effect of the Mergers on Share Capital of the Company, Merger
Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2_.

 



 

(a) At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any
action on the part of any holder of any securities of the Company or Merger
Sub 1:

 



 

(i) All Company Shares that are owned directly or indirectly by Parent, any
Subsidiary of Parent or any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the
First Effective Time shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

(ii) Subject to _Section 2.09_ and _Section 2.12(e)_, each Company Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time (other
than (A) shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.05(a)(i)_, and
(B) subject to the provisions of _Section 2.08_, Dissenting Shares) shall at
the First Effective Time be converted into the right to receive (x) $46.75 in
cash, without interest (the " **Per Share Cash Amount** "), and (y) 0.8708
(such ratio, as may be adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.06_, the " **Exchange
Ratio** ") of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Parent Share
(the " **Per Share Parent Share Amount** ") (the consideration payable in
accordance with this _Section 2.05(a)(ii)_, the " **Merger Consideration**
"), less any applicable withholding Taxes in accordance with _Section
2.10(i)_; _provided_ that cash shall be payable in respect of fractional
Parent Shares sold in accordance with _Section 2.07_.

 



 

(iii) As of the First Effective Time, all Company Shares converted into the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.05(a)_ shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of (A) a certificate
that immediately prior to the First Effective Time represented any such
Company Shares (a " **Certificate** ") or (B) Company Shares held in book-
entry form (" **Book-Entry Shares** ") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except (subject to _Section 2.08_) (1) the Merger
Consideration and (2) the right to receive any other amounts expressly
provided herein, without interest, subject to compliance with the procedures
set forth in _Section 2.10_.

 



 

(iv) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub 1 issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be converted into and
become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable common share, par
value $0.10 per share, of the First Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) At the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without
any action on the part of any holder of any securities of the First Surviving
Corporation or Merger Sub 2:

 



 

(i) Each common share, par value $0.10 per share, of the First Surviving
Corporation shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

(ii) Each limited liability company interest of Merger Sub 2 issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall

 



      
 

 



 

remain outstanding as a limited liability company interest of the Surviving
Company.

 



 

Section 2.06 _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (a)
the First Effective Time or (b) any termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article 10_, the outstanding Parent Shares or Company Shares
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class
by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares,
readjustment, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend thereon shall
be declared with a record date within said period, then the Exchange Ratio and
any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide Parent and the holders of Company Shares
(including Company Options exercisable for Company Shares) the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event, including any
volume weighted average price determinations. Nothing in this _Section 2.06_
shall be construed to permit any Party to take any action that is otherwise
prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.07 _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip or book-entry
notations representing fractional Parent Shares shall be issued upon the
conversion of Company Shares pursuant to _Section 2.05(a)_. In respect of any
such fractional shares, each holder of record of Company Shares who would
otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares shall be entitled to receive,
from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this _Section
2.07_, a cash payment representing such holders proportionate interest, if
any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced by any fees
of the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale), as agent for former holders
of Company Shares, in one or more transactions of Parent Shares (which Parent
shall issue to the Exchange Agent on behalf of such former holders of Company
Shares) equal to the excess of (a) the aggregate number of shares to be
delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to _Section 2.10(a)_ over
(b) the aggregate number of whole Parent Shares to be issued to the holders of
Company Shares pursuant to _Section 2.05(a)_. As soon as practicable after
the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
Company Shares in respect of any fractional share interests in Parent Shares,
the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts, without interest, to the
holders of Company Shares entitled to receive such cash.

 



 

Section 2.08 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Company Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the
First Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand
and properly demands dissenters rights with respect to such shares ("
**Dissenting Shares** ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Sections 471 and 473 of the MBCA (" **Sections 471 and 473** ") shall not be
converted into the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.05_, but
rather the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to payment by the
Surviving Company of the "fair value" of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with Sections 471 and 473; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose dissenters
rights pursuant to (or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
such holder is not entitled to receive fair value pursuant to) Sections 471
and 473, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the First Effective Time into, and to have
become exchangeable solely for, the

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.05_. The Company shall provide
prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for dissenters
rights with respect to any Company Shares, written notices of intent to
demand, written withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to Sections 471 and 473 received by the Company and any other
documents related thereto received from any Person purporting to seek to
exercise dissenters rights. Parent shall have the right to participate in and
direct all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to
the First Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Prior to the
First Effective Time, Parent shall not, except with the prior written consent
of the Company, require the Company to make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal, or offer to settle or settle any such demands if such
settlement would involve payment prior to the Closing or would otherwise not
be contingent upon the Closing.

 



 

Section 2.09 _Limitation on Cash Consideration Payable_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Threshold Percentage
(determined without regard to this sentence) is less than 41%, then an amount
of cash otherwise payable to the holders of Company Shares under this
Agreement (other than to holders of Dissenting Shares), equal to the amount of
cash which would be necessary to cause the recomputed Threshold Percentage to
equal 41%, shall instead be payable to such holders in an equivalent amount of
Parent Shares (with each Parent Share valued for this purpose at $43.93);
_provided_ that cash shall be payable in respect of fractional Parent Shares
in accordance with _Section 2.07_. This _Section 2.09_ (including the
defined terms used herein) is intended to cause this Agreement to satisfy the
requirements of Treasury Regulations section 1.368-1(e) (treating not less
than 41% as a "substantial part" for such purpose) and shall be interpreted in
a manner consistent therewith.

 



 

Section 2.10 _Exchange of Company Shares_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a customary
exchange agreement in form reasonably acceptable to the Company with a
nationally recognized financial institution designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " **Exchange Agent** "), and shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company
Shares, for exchange in accordance with this _Article 2_, through the
Exchange Agent, book-entry shares representing the full number of whole Parent
Shares issuable pursuant to _Section 2.05_ in exchange for outstanding
Company Shares (disregarding for this purpose the proviso in _Section
2.05(a)(ii))_. Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent shall provide or
shall cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent cash in an aggregate amount
necessary to pay the Per Share Cash Amount in exchange for outstanding Company
Shares pursuant to _Section 2.05_, and Parent shall, after the First
Effective Time on the appropriate payment date, if applicable, provide or
cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other
distributions payable on such Parent Shares pursuant to _Section 2.10(c)_
which had not theretofore been surrendered for exchange or been exchanged
pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)(ii)_ (such Parent Shares and cash provided to
the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or other distributions with
respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to as the " **Exchange Fund** ").
The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration to be issued
pursuant to _Section 2.05_ out of the Exchange Fund. Except as provided in
_Section 2.10(h)_, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(i) _Certificates_. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the First Effective Time (but in no event more
than four Business Days thereafter), to each holder of record of a Certificate
whose Company Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.05_, (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form and have such other provisions
as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as
promptly as practicable, (A) cash in an amount equal to the Per Share Cash
Amount multiplied by the number of Company Shares previously represented by
such Certificate, (B) the number of Parent Shares (which shall be in book-
entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that
such holder has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant
to _Section 2.05(a)(ii)_ (after taking into account all other Company Shares
held by such holder that are converted into the Merger Consideration), (C) any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.10(c)(i)_ and
(D) cash in respect of fractional Parent Shares payable pursuant to _Section
2.07_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and shares may be
issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Company that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate.

 



 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this _Article 2_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record
of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose Company Shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.05_ shall
automatically upon the First Effective Time (or, at any later time at which
such Book-Entry Shares shall be so converted) be entitled to receive, and
Parent shall cause the

 



      
 

 



 

Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after the First
Effective Time, (A) cash in an amount equal to the Per Share Cash Amount
multiplied by the number of Company Shares previously represented by such
Book-Entry Shares, (B) the number of Parent Shares (which shall be in book-
entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that
such holder has the right to receive in respect of such Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to _Section 2.05(a)(ii)_ (after taking into account all other
Company Shares held by such holder that are converted into the Merger
Consideration), (C) any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 2.10(c)(ii)_ and (D) cash in respect of any fractional shares
payable pursuant to _Section 2.07_, and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash
payable upon conversion of any Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_.

 



 

(i) _Certificates_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent
Shares with a record date after the First Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any Certificate formerly representing Company Shares, and no cash
payment in respect of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to _Section 2.07_, until the surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with this _Article 2_. Subject to applicable Law, following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the
Parent Shares issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time
of delivery of such Parent Shares by the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section
2.10(b)(i)_, in addition to the Merger Consideration, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the First Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such Parent Shares and (B) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the First Effective Time but prior to such delivery of such Parent
Shares by the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)(i)_, and a payment
date subsequent to such delivery of such Parent Shares by the Exchange Agent
pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)(i)_, payable with respect to such Parent Shares.

 



 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Subject to applicable Law, there shall be paid to
the holder of the Parent Shares issued in exchange for Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with this _Article 2_, without interest, (A) at the time of
delivery of such Parent Shares by the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section
2.10(b)(ii)_, in addition to the Merger Consideration, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the First Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such Parent Shares and (B) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the First Effective Time but prior to the time of such delivery by
the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)(ii)_, and a payment date
subsequent to the time of such delivery by the Exchange Agent pursuant to
_Section 2.10(b)(ii)_, payable with respect to such Parent Shares.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this
_Article 2_ upon the surrender of the Certificates (or, immediately, in the
case of the Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to be in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such Company Shares (other than the right to receive
dividends or other distributions, if any, in accordance with _Section
2.10(c)_). After the First Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the transfer books of the Surviving Company of
Company Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective
Time. If, after the First Effective Time, any Certificates formerly
representing Company Shares are presented to the Surviving Company or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article 2_.

 



 

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former
holders of Company Shares for one (1) year after the First Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Company, upon demand, and any former
holder of Company Shares who has not theretofore complied with this _Article
2_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for payment of its
claim for the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with
respect to Parent Shares as contemplated by _Section 2.10(c)_.

 



 

(f) None of Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, the Company, the Surviving
Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any
Parent Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash
from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed by former holders of Company Shares
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable amount as Parent or the
Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Company with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends or other
distributions that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to _Section 2.10(c)_ had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been
surrendered as provided in this _Article 2_.

 



 

(h) The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such investment income or
gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company
Shares. Any interest, gains and other income resulting from such investments
shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent payable to Parent upon its
request, and no part of such interest, gains and other income shall accrue to
the benefit of holders of Company Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term
obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and
interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors

 



      
 

 



 

Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that
are then publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon
shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Shares pursuant to this
_Article 2_. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange
Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to
be made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit
cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in
the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

 



 

(i) Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any former
holder of Company Options, Company RSU Awards or Surrendered Company
Restricted Share Awards (collectively, the " **Company Share Awards** ") or
Company Shares pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law and further
shall be entitled to make any required reporting regarding such payment to the
appropriate Taxing Authority. Any amount deducted or withheld pursuant to this
_Section 2.10(i)_, and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, shall
be treated as having been paid or issued, as applicable, to the holder of
Company Shares or Company Share Awards in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made. With respect to withholding on payments to a holder of
Company Shares, such withholding shall be made first from the cash otherwise
payable to such holder prior to withholding from Parent Shares. In the case of
any withholding from Parent Shares, Parent shall withhold an amount of Parent
Shares having a fair market value equal to the withholding obligation to be
satisfied with such Parent Shares at the time such shares are withheld, and
shall be treated as having paid such amount to the Person from whom withheld.
Parent shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all amounts so deducted or
withheld to the appropriate Taxing Authority within the period required under
applicable Law. With respect to the Merger Consideration payable to any
individual in respect of Surrendered Company Options, Surrendered Company RSU
Awards or Surrendered Company Restricted Share Awards, any applicable Tax
withholding shall first reduce the Per Share Cash Amount, and if the Per Share
Cash Amount is reduced to $0, any additional Tax withholding shall next reduce
the Per Share Parent Share Amount.

 



 

Section 2.11 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the First Effective
Time, the First Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company shall determine
that any actions are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the First Surviving Corporation or the Surviving
Company its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of any of the Company, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2
acquired or to be acquired by the First Surviving Corporation or the Surviving
Company as a result of, or in connection with, the Mergers or otherwise to
carry out this Agreement, then the respective officers and directors and
manager of the First Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company, as
applicable, shall be authorized to take all such actions as may be necessary
or desirable to vest all right, title or interest in, to and under such
rights, properties or assets in the First Surviving Corporation or the
Surviving Company or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 2.12 _Company Share Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Surrendered Company Options_. Each option to purchase Company Shares
granted under a Company Share Plan and any other compensatory option to
purchase Company Shares (excluding any option granted under the ESPP or the
Japan ESPP), in each case, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
First Effective Time and is either vested as of immediately prior to the First
Effective Time or will become vested by its terms as a result of the
occurrence of the First Effective Time (each, a " **Surrendered Company
Option** "), as of the First Effective Time, shall be deemed exercised
pursuant to a cashless exercise (in which Company Shares are deemed to be
withheld to fund the exercise price due in connection with such exercise) and
settled by issuance of that number of Company Shares (the " **Net Exercise
Shares** ") equal to the excess (rounded down to the nearest whole share, but
with any partial shares otherwise issuable settled in cash) of (i) the number
of Company Shares subject to such Surrendered Company Option as of immediately
prior to the First Effective Time over (ii) the number of whole and partial
(computed to the nearest four decimal places) Company Shares that, when
multiplied by the "Fair Market Value" (as defined in the applicable Company
Share Plan), is equal to the aggregate exercise price of such Surrendered
Company Option. Each Net Exercise Share shall be canceled and converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding
Taxes in accordance with _Section 2.10(i)_, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
following the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) _Assumed Company Options_. Each option to purchase Company Shares granted
under a Company Share Plan and any other compensatory option to purchase
Company Shares (excluding any option granted under the ESPP or the Japan
ESPP), in each case, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the First
Effective Time and is not a Surrendered Company Option (each, an " **Assumed
Company Option** ", and together with the Surrendered Company Options, the "
**Company Options** "), as of the First Effective Time, shall be assumed by
Parent and converted into an option to acquire, on substantially the same
terms and conditions as were applicable to such Assumed Company Option
immediately prior to the First Effective Time (with the terms and conditions
relating to vesting to remain the same, it being understood that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute a "change in control"
for purposes of the Company Share Plans and award agreements thereunder), the
number of Parent Shares equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) of (i) the number of Company Shares subject to such Assumed
Company Option as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time multiplied
by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per Parent Share
equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) of (A) the per
share exercise price for the Company Shares subject to such Assumed Company
Option as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time divided by (B) the
Stock Award Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that the vesting of each
Assumed Company Option, to the extent then unvested, shall immediately
accelerate in full upon the second anniversary of the First Effective Time if
the holder of the Assumed Company Option remains employed with Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company) as of the second anniversary of
the First Effective Time. The exercise price per Parent Share subject to any
such Assumed Company Option will be determined in a manner consistent with
requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior
to the Closing Date, Parent may elect to treat some

 



      
 

 



 

or all Company Options that would otherwise be Assumed Company Options as
Surrendered Company Options, which shall be settled in accordance with
_Section 2.12(a)_.

 



 

(c) _Surrendered Company RSU Awards_. Each restricted stock unit award with
respect to Company Shares that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
First Effective Time and is vested as of immediately prior to the First
Effective Time or will become vested by its terms as a result of the
occurrence of the First Effective Time and, in each case, by its terms is to
be settled in connection with the occurrence of vesting or the First Effective
Time (each, a " **Surrendered Company RSU Award** "), as of the First
Effective Time, shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (or, with respect to Surrendered Company RSU Awards that
are settled in cash under their existing terms, the cash equivalent thereof
based on the value of the Merger Consideration as of the First Effective Time)
with respect to each Company Share subject to the Surrendered Company RSU
Award, less any applicable withholding Taxes in accordance with _Section
2.10(i)_, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date but in
no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) _Assumed Company RSU Awards_. Each restricted stock unit award with
respect to Company Shares that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
First Effective Time and is not a Surrendered Company RSU Award (each, an "
**Assumed Company RSU Award** " and together with the Surrendered Company RSU
Awards, the " **Company RSU Awards** "), as of the First Effective Time, shall
be assumed by Parent and converted into an award of restricted stock units,
with substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such
Assumed Company RSU Award immediately prior to the First Effective Time (with
the terms and conditions relating to vesting to remain the same, it being
understood that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute a
"change in control" for purposes of the Company Share Plans and award
agreements thereunder), in respect of the number of Parent Shares equal to the
product (rounded to the nearest whole share) of (i) the number of Company
Shares subject to such Assumed Company RSU Award as of immediately prior to
the First Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the vesting of each Assumed Company RSU Award,
to the extent then unvested, shall immediately accelerate in full upon the
second anniversary of the First Effective Time (with settlement to occur at
such time as permitted under Section 409A of the Code) if the holder of the
Assumed Company RSU Award remains employed with Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Company) as of the second anniversary of the First
Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Closing Date,
Parent may elect to treat some or all Company RSU Awards that would otherwise
be Assumed Company RSU Awards as Surrendered Company RSU Awards, which shall
be settled in accordance with _Section 2.12(c)_, _provided_ that the
applicable settlement date may be delayed to the extent required by Section
409A of the Code.

 



 

(e) _Surrendered Company Restricted Share Awards_. Each restricted share award
of Company Shares that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the First
Effective Time and is vested or would become vested by its terms as a result
of the occurrence of the First Effective Time (each, a " **Surrendered Company
Restricted Share Award** "), as of the First Effective Time, shall vest as of
the First Effective Time and shall be canceled and converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each Company Share subject to
the Surrendered Company Restricted Share Award, less any applicable
withholding Taxes in

 



      
 

 



 

accordance with _Section 2.10(i)_, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
following the Closing Date. Parent and the Company agree that all restricted
share awards currently outstanding (the " **Company Restricted Share Awards**
"), shall be or become vested as of immediately prior to the First Effective
Time.

 



 

(f) _Parent Actions_. Parent shall take such actions as are reasonably
necessary to reserve for issuance a number of authorized but unissued Parent
Shares for delivery upon exercise or settlement of the Assumed Company Options
and Assumed Company RSU Awards. No later than the First Effective Time, Parent
shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on an appropriate
form, or a post-effective amendment to a registration statement previously
filed under the 1933 Act, with respect to the Parent Shares subject to the
Assumed Company Options and Assumed Company RSU Awards. Parent will use the
same level of efforts Parent uses to maintain the effectiveness of its other
registration statements on Form S-8 to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement for so long as any Assumed Company Options or Assumed
Company RSU Awards remain outstanding. Parent may process any payments
contemplated by this _Section 2.12_ through the payroll of Parent, the
Surviving Company or their respective Affiliates.

 



 

(g) _Company Actions_. Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company shall
(i) take such actions with respect to the Companys equity compensation plans
or arrangements as are reasonably necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 2.12_, including (x) providing notice to each
holder of a Company Share Award in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent of
the treatment of the Company Share Awards set forth in this Agreement and (y)
satisfying all applicable requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the
1934 Act, and (ii) if requested by Parent, take such actions as are reasonably
necessary to freeze the Companys equity compensation plans such that no
future awards may be granted from and after the First Effective Time. The
Company shall provide Parent with drafts of, and a reasonable opportunity to
comment upon, all resolutions and other written actions as may be required to
give effect to the provisions of this _Section 2.12_. For the avoidance of
doubt, the treatment of Company Share Awards set forth in this Agreement shall
not require the consent of each holder of a Company Share Award.

 



 

Section 2.13 _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall take all actions that are reasonably necessary to ensure
that (i) no new offering periods under the Companys 2007 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, as amended (the " **ESPP** ") will commence during the period
from the date of this Agreement through the First Effective Time, (ii) there
will be no increase in the amount of payroll deductions permitted to be made
by the participants under the ESPP during the current offering periods, except
those made in accordance with payroll deduction elections that are in effect
as of the date of this Agreement, and (iii) no individuals shall commence
participation in the ESPP during the period from the date of this Agreement
through the First Effective Time. The accumulated contributions of the
participants in the current offering periods under the ESPP shall be used to
purchase Company Shares as of no later than five Business Days prior to the
First Effective Time, and the participants purchase rights under such
offerings shall terminate immediately after such purchase.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, within fourteen Business Days
after the date hereof, the Company shall (i) give notice of the amendment to
the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Savings Plan currently maintained for
employees located in Japan (the " **Japan ESPP** ") in accordance with Article
24 thereof so that (A) no new offering periods will commence under the Japan
ESPP during the period from the date of this Agreement through the First
Effective Time, (B) there will be no increase in the amount of payroll
deductions permitted to be made by the participants under the Japan ESPP
during the current offering periods, except those made in accordance with
payroll deduction elections that are in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, and (C) no individuals shall commence participation in the Japan
ESPP during the period from the date of this Agreement through the First
Effective Time, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
amendment to become effective in accordance with Article 24 of the Japan ESPP
as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof. The accumulated
contributions of the participants in the current offering periods under the
Japan ESPP shall be used to purchase Company Shares as of no later than five
Business Days prior to the First Effective Time, and the participants
purchase rights under such offerings shall terminate immediately after such
purchase.

 



 

(c) The Company Shares purchased pursuant to this _Section 2.13_ shall be
treated the same as all other Company Shares in accordance with _Section
2.05_. As of no later than the Business Day immediately prior to the First
Effective Time, the Company shall terminate the ESPP and the Japan ESPP.

duly organized, validly existing and (where applicable or recognized) in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization,

has all corporate, limited liability company or comparable powers and all
Governmental Authorizations required to carry on its business as now
conducted, except for those powers or Governmental Authorizations the absence

qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be

or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in internal controls.

not misleading or (b) the definitive proxy statement/prospectus to be sent to
the Company shareholders in connection with the First Merger and the other

the time of the Company Shareholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the

occurred that caused or would reasonably be expected to result in the loss of
such qualification or the imposition of any material penalty or material Tax

Plan complies in form and has been maintained and operated in accordance with

Effect. No Company Plan provides post-termination or retirement health and
welfare benefits to any current or former employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, except as required under Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6 of

independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether

other benefit, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any
payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of any compensation
or benefits, (iii) increase the amount payable or trigger any other obligation
pursuant to any Company Plan or (iv) result in any limitation on the right of

to any "disqualified individual" will fail to be deductible for federal income
tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the Code or subject to an excise tax
under Section 4999 of the Code as a result of the occurrence of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any obligation to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise
reimburse any current or former employee, director or independent contractor
of the Company or

liability.

Effect, (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all
applicable Laws in respect of employment and employment practices and terms
and conditions of employment and wages and hours, (ii) no Person has been

incorporated or otherwise duly organized, validly existing and (where
applicable or recognized) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction
of incorporation or organization, except where the failure to be so
incorporated, organized, existing or in good standing would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Each Subsidiary of Parent has all corporate, limited liability company
or comparable powers and all Governmental Authorizations required to carry on
its business as now conducted, except for those powers or Governmental
Authorizations the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each such
Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except
for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. _Section 5.06_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a
complete and accurate list as of the date hereof of each Significant
Subsidiary (for the avoidance of doubt, _Section 5.06_ of the Parent
Disclosure Letter also sets forth additional wholly owned Subsidiaries which
are not Significant Subsidiaries) of Parent and its jurisdiction of
organization.

 



 

Section 5.07 _SEC Filings and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act_. (a) Parent has filed
with or furnished to the SEC (including following any extensions of time for

schedules, forms, statements, prospectuses, registration statements and other
documents required to be filed or furnished, as the case may be, by Parent
since January 1, 2014 (collectively, together with any exhibits and schedules
thereto and other information incorporated therein, the " **Parent SEC
Documents** ").

 



 

(b) As of the date it was filed or furnished to the SEC (or, if amended or
supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or supplement filed
or furnished prior to the date of this Agreement), each Parent SEC Document
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the 1933
Act and the 1934 Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and any rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, as the case may be.

 



 

(c) As of the date it was filed or furnished to the SEC (or, if amended or
supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or supplement filed
or furnished prior to the date of this Agreement), each Parent SEC Document
did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading in any material
respect. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC staff with
respect to the Parent SEC Documents.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act). Such disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that material information

others within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the
periodic reports required under the 1934 Act are being prepared.

 



 

(e) Parent has established and maintained a system of internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act) ("
**internal controls** ") as required by Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act. As of
the date hereof, Parent has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of
internal controls prior to the date of this Agreement, to Parents auditors
and audit committee (i) any "significant deficiencies" and "material
weaknesses" (as defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) in
the design or operation of Parents internal controls which would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect in any material respect Parents ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud
as to which Parent has knowledge, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in internal
controls.

 



 

Section 5.08 _Financial Statements_. The audited consolidated financial
statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of Parent
included or incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Documents (including
all related notes and schedules thereto) (a) fairly present, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated results of
operations and cash flows for the periods shown (subject to normal and
immaterial year-end adjustments in the case of any unaudited quarterly and
other interim financial statements), (b) comply in all material respects with
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (c)
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited
interim and quarterly statements, as may be permitted under Form 10-Q and the
Exchange Act and other rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto or as permitted under Regulation S-X).

 



 

Section 5.09 _Disclosure Documents_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in (a) the Registration Statement will, at the
time the Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading or (b) the definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the
date it is first mailed to the Company shareholders or at the time of the
Company Shareholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
representation or warranty is made by Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2
with respect to information or statements made or incorporated by reference in
the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus which were not
supplied by or on behalf of the Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.10 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company complete and accurate copies of fully
executed debt commitment letters, including all annexes, schedules and
exhibits thereto and the fee letter related thereto in effect as of the date
hereof, from Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated and Bank of
America, N.A. (collectively, the " **Financing Commitment Letters** ")
pursuant to which Bank of America, N.A. has agreed, subject to the terms and
conditions therein, to provide Parent with debt financing in the amounts set
forth therein for purposes set forth therein (such debt financing, as it may
be modified, amended, replaced or supplemented in accordance with this
Agreement, the " **Debt Financing** "); _provided_ , that in the case of any
fee letter related to the Debt Financing, the fee amounts, yield or interest
rate caps, original issue discount amounts, "market flex" and other economic
terms set forth therein may be redacted in a customary manner.

 



 

(b) As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitment Letters are in full force
and effect and are valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and,
to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting creditors rights
generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law). As of the
date hereof, no Financing Commitment Letter has been withdrawn, terminated,
repudiated, rescinded, amended or modified in any respect.

 



 

(c) As of the date hereof, no event has occurred or circumstance exists that,
with or without notice, the lapse of time or both, would reasonably be
expected to constitute or result in a breach or default on the part of Parent
or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other Person under any of the Financing
Commitment Letters.

 



 

(d) As of the date hereof, there are no side letters, contracts or
arrangements relating to the Debt Financing that impose conditions or
contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing,
in each case other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitment
Letters. As of the date hereof, assuming the representations and warranties of
the Company contained in this Agreement are true and correct in all material
respects and the performance of all obligations and compliance with all
covenants and agreements required by this Agreement to be performed or
complied with at or prior to the Closing by the Company in all material
respects, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Debt Financing will not be satisfied, nor does Parent have knowledge, as of
the date hereof, that the Debt Financing will not be made available to Parent
on the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the Financing Commitment
Letters.

 



 

(e) The Debt Financing (both before and after giving effect to any "market
flex" provisions), when funded on the Closing Date in accordance with the
Financing Commitment Letters, together with other financial resources of
Parent available on the Closing Date, will provide Parent with funds at the
First Effective Time sufficient to: (i) pay all cash amounts required to be
paid by Parent under or in connection with this Agreement; (ii) pay any and
all fees and expenses of or payable by Parent with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Mergers and the Debt Financing;
and (iii) satisfy all of the other payment obligations of Parent contemplated
hereunder.

 



       
 

 



 

(f) Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, it is
understood and agreed that a breach of the representations and warranties
contained in this _Section 5.10_ shall not result in the failure of a
condition precedent to the Companys obligations under this Agreement if,
notwithstanding such breach, Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 are willing
and able to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the
Closing Date in accordance with the terms hereof.

Effect.

operations prior to the First Effective Time, and nothing contained in this
Agreement is intended to give the Company, directly or indirectly,

Section 6.02 _Company Shareholder Meeting_. The Company shall duly call, give

proxies in favor of the approval of the First merger and adoption of the Plan
of Merger and take all other actions reasonably necessary or advisable to
secure the approval of the First Merger and adoption of the Plan of Merger by
the Companys shareholders. Subject to _Section 8.03_, the Company shall keep
Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 updated with respect to proxy
solicitation results as reasonably requested by Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger
Sub 2. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,

Company Shareholder Meeting (i) after consultation with Parent, to the extent
necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is provided to the shareholders of the Company within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Shareholder Meeting, (ii)
if as of the time for which the Company Shareholder Meeting is originally
scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there are
insufficient Company Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Shareholder Meeting or (iii) to solicit additional proxies if, as of the time
the Company Shareholder Meeting is scheduled to be held, insufficient Company
Shares have been voted in favor of the approval of the First Merger and
adoption of the Plan of Merger to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval;
_provided, however_ , that the Company shall not in any event adjourn, recess
or postpone the Company Shareholder Meeting for more than 30 days with respect
to any one adjournment, recess or postponement without Parents prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). The Company may propose that the shareholders of the Company
also act at the Company Shareholder Meeting on the matters set forth in the
Companys definitive proxy statement filed on March 22, 2016 and any other
matters required by applicable Law to be proposed at the next annual meeting
of shareholders of the Company. It is agreed that regardless of whether there
is a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company Shareholder Meeting
shall be held in accordance with the terms hereof unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Article 10_.

the First Surviving

 



      
 

 



 

Corporation and the Surviving Company to, (x) in the case of a Company
Indemnitee, as defined below, to the fullest extent that the Company may do so
(as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time) under applicable Law
with respect to its own directors and officers and (y) in the case of a
Subsidiary Indemnitee, as defined below, to the fullest extent that the
Subsidiary of which such Subsidiary Indemnitee is or was a director or officer
may do so (as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time) under
applicable Law with respect to its own directors and officers, (i) jointly and
severally indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the First
Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the First Effective Time was, a
director or officer of the Company (a " **Company Indemnitee** ") or of a
Subsidiary of the Company (a " **Subsidiary Indemnitee** " and, together with
the Company Indemnitees, collectively, the " **Indemnitees** ") with respect
to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties,
costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses
(including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with
any Proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative),
whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the
fact that an Indemnitee is or was a director or officer of the Company or such
Subsidiary, (B) the fact that an Indemnitee is or was a director, partner,
trustee, officer, employee or agent of any other corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise which such
person is or was serving at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary, (C)
acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitees capacity as a director

request of the Company or taken at the request of such corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise,
in each case under clauses (A), (B), (C) or (D), at, or at any time prior to,
the First Effective Time (including any Proceeding relating in whole or in
part to the Mergers or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any
other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnitee) and (ii) assume
(in the case of the First Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Company, in
the Mergers without any further action) all obligations of the Company and
such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the First Effective Time as provided in the articles
of incorporation or bylaws of the Company and the organizational documents of

agreement in existence as of the date of this Agreement providing for
indemnification between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any
Indemnitee, a complete copy of which has been provided by the Company to

Parent, from and after the First Effective Time, shall cause, unless otherwise
required by Law, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the First
Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company, as applicable, to contain
provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of
liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than are set forth
as of the date of this Agreement in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of
the Company, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the
Indemnitees. In addition, from the First Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the First Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company, as
applicable, to advance any expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of
legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this _Section_

obligations referred to in this _Section 7.04_) as incurred (x) in the case
of a Company Indemnitee, to the fullest extent that the Company may do so (as
of immediately prior to the First Effective Time) under applicable Law with
respect to its own directors and officers and (y) in the case of a Subsidiary
Indemnitee, to the fullest extent that the Subsidiary of which such Subsidiary
Indemnitee is or was a director or officer may do so (as of immediately prior
to the First Effective Time) under applicable Law with respect to its own
directors and officers; _provided_ that the individual to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it shall be
determined that such Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this
_Section 7.04(a)_ or applicable Law.

 



 

(b) None of Parent, the First Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company
shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
threatened or actual litigation, claim or proceeding relating to any acts or
omissions covered under this _Section 7.04_ (each, a " **Claim** ") for which
indemnification has been sought by an Indemnitee hereunder, unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes a complete release of such
Indemnitee from all liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnitee
otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. Each
of Parent, the First Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company and the
Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall provide

(c) Parent shall cause the First Surviving Corporation and the Surviving
Company, and the First Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company hereby
agree, to either (i) continue to maintain in effect for a period of no less
than six (6) years after the First Effective Time the Companys directors and
officers insurance policies (the " **D andO Insurance**") in place as of the
date of this Agreement or (ii) purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six
(6)-year period from a reputable insurer, in each case, with coverage for
Indemnitees, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at
least as favorable to the Indemnitees as the Companys existing DandO Insurance
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the First
Effective Time; _provided_ , that in no event shall Parent, the First
Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company be required to expend for such
policies pursuant to this sentence an aggregate annual premium amount in
excess of 250% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full
fiscal year, which amount is set forth in _Section 7.04(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter (the " **Premium Cap** "); and _provided_ , _further_ , that
if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
First Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters
occurring prior to the First Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding the
Premium Cap. At the Companys option, the Company may (in consultation with
Parent) purchase, prior to the First Effective Time, a prepaid "tail policy"
for a period of no more than six (6) years after the First Effective Time with
coverage for Indemnitees, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of
coverage substantially equivalent in terms of favorability to the insured
individuals as the Companys existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the First Effective Time at an aggregate
cost up to but not exceeding the aggregate maximum amount payable pursuant to
the proviso above for such six year period, in which event Parent shall cease
to have any obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this _Section
7.04(c)_. In the event the Company elects to purchase such a "tail policy,"
the First

 



      
 

 



 

Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company shall (and Parent shall cause
the First Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company to) use reasonable
best efforts to maintain such "tail policy" in full force and effect for its
full term and continue to honor its obligations thereunder.

 



 

(d) In the event that Parent or any of its successors and assigns dissolves
the First Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company, or either Parent,
the First Surviving Corporation, or the Surviving Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or, (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties, rights and other assets to any Person, then, and in each
such case, Parent shall cause the successors and assigns of Parent, the First
Surviving Corporation, or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, to
succeed to or assume the applicable obligations of such Party set forth in
this _Section 7.04_.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 7.04_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have
by the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, Contract, at Law
or otherwise. The obligations of Parent, the First Surviving Corporation, and
the Surviving Company under this _Section 7.04_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee
to whom this _Section 7.04_ applies unless (x) such termination or
modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee
shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section 7.04_ applies
shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.04_).

 



 

(f) Parents, the First Surviving Corporations, and the Surviving Companys
obligations under this _Section 7.04_ shall continue in full force and effect
for a period of six years from the First Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any Claim (whether arising before, at or after the First
Effective Time) is brought against an Indemnitee on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the First Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section
7.04_ shall continue in effect until the full and final resolution of such
Claim.

 



 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers, other employees, or other Indemnitees, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 7.04_ is not
prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 



 

Section 7.05 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Parent Shares to be issued as part of the Merger
Consideration to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official
notice of issuance, prior to the First Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.06 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the requirements of applicable Law and the terms of any
applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement, from the First Effective Time
until the later of December 31, 2017 or the first anniversary of the First
Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each
employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by
Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries) immediately following the First Effective Time (each, a "
**Continuing Employee** ") while such employee is so employed, with (i) base
salary or wages and (subject to the terms of _Section 7.06(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter) annual cash incentive compensation opportunity that, in
each case, are no less favorable than the base salary or wages and annual cash
incentive compensation opportunity available to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the First Effective Time, (ii) severance benefits to each
Continuing Employee that are no less favorable than those that would have been
provided to such Continuing Employee under the Company Plans that provide
severance benefits as in effect on the date of this Agreement and identified
in _Section 4.17(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (it being understood
that upon the expiration of the change-in-control protection period in effect
as of the date hereof under the Thoratec Corporation and Subsidiaries
Separation Benefits Plan (whether prior to or after the Closing Date), any
individuals who were eligible participants in such plan who become Continuing
Employees will cease to be covered by such plan and will instead be covered by
the broad-based Company severance plan applicable to similarly situated
Continuing Employees), and (iii) employee health and welfare and retirement
benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the
First Effective Time. In addition, unless the Company has granted the awards
contemplated by Item 4 of _Section 6.01(b)(xii)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, a long-term incentive
award opportunity in 2017 to each Continuing Employee employed by Parent or
its Subsidiaries at the time annual long-term incentive awards are made by
Parent generally, on a basis consistent with Parents practices (including
with respect to eligibility) for awarding long-term incentive awards to
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries generally.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 7.06(a)_, from and after the
First Effective Time, Parent shall honor, or shall cause to be honored, in
accordance with their terms all the Company Plans as in effect at the First
Effective Time, including the Companys Management Savings Plan, it being
understood that the foregoing shall not limit the right of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company, to amend or terminate any
Company Plan, including the Companys Management Savings Plan, in accordance
with its terms. Parent acknowledges and agrees that the consummation of the
First Merger shall be considered a "change in control" for all purposes under
all Company Plans (and related award agreements) that contain a definition
"change in control" or any similar term relating to the Company, and excluding
the Company Plans that are or were sponsored or maintained by Thoratec
Corporation and its Subsidiaries (including any severance or equity plans).

 



 

(c) To the extent that Continuing Employees become eligible to participate in
the "employee benefit plans," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA (whether or
not subject to ERISA), maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " **Parent Plans** "), then, for purposes of determining
(i) eligibility to participate, vesting, level of benefits and benefit

 



      
 

 



 

accrual, service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
First Effective Time shall be treated as service with Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to the extent recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries
prior to the First Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service
shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in
any duplication of benefits, and Parent shall not be required to provide
credit for any purpose under any Parent Plan that is (A) a cash or equity
incentive compensation plan, (B) a defined benefit pension plan, (C) a post-
retirement welfare plan or (D) any Parent Plan under which similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior
service or that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of
benefits or participation. In addition, subject to applicable Law, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, (x) waive all limitations as
to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to Continuing Employees
under any Parent Plan that is a welfare benefit plan in which such Continuing
Employees may be eligible to participate after the First Effective Time and
(y) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide each Continuing Employee
with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid during the plan year in
which the First Effective Time occurs (or, if later, the year in which the
applicable Continuing Employee is first eligible to participate in the
applicable Parent Plan) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements under any Parent Plans that are welfare plans in which
such Continuing Employee is eligible to participate after the First Effective
Time, in each case, to the extent such expenses would have been credited under
the Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately
prior to the First Effective Time.

 



 

(d) If requested by Parent not less than ten (10) Business Days before the
Closing Date, the Company shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate
action as is necessary to terminate the Company Plans that are Tax-qualified
defined contribution plans (collectively, the " **Company Qualified DC Plan**
"), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date. The form and substance
of such resolutions and any other actions taken in connection with the
foregoing termination shall be subject to the review and approval of Parent,
not to be unreasonably withheld. Upon the distribution of the assets in the
accounts under the Company Qualified DC Plan to the participants, Parent shall
permit such participants who are then actively employed by Parent or its
Subsidiaries to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code), in the
form of cash or in kind with respect to any plan loans, from the Company
Qualified DC Plan to the applicable Tax-qualified defined contribution plans
of Parent or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.06_, expressed or implied, shall (i)
be treated as the establishment, amendment or modification of any Company Plan
or Parent Plan or constitute a limitation on rights to amend, modify, merge or
terminate after the First Effective Time any Company Plan or Parent Plan, (ii)
give any current or former employee, director or independent contractor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any beneficiary or dependent
thereof), or any labor organization, union, works council, employee
association, trade union, other similar employee representative or employee
committee or plan, any third-party beneficiary or other rights under this
Agreement or (iii) obligate Parent or any of its Affiliates to (A) maintain
any particular Company Plan or Parent Plan or (B) retain the employment or
services of any current or former employee, director or independent
contractor.

conditions to the consummation of the Mergers pursuant to _Article 9_), and
(iii) executing and delivering any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall make, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any
event, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, within 45 calendar days after
the date of this Agreement with respect to subclause (i) below), (i) an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) an appropriate

Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to supply
as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the foregoing or
pursuant to any other applicable Competition Laws, and use its reasonable best
efforts to take all other actions necessary, or cooperate with the other Party
with respect to its actions, including taking the actions set forth in
_Section 8.01(e)_, to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods or obtain consents regarding the foregoing in order to satisfy
the condition set forth in _Section 9.01(e)(ii)_ as soon as practicable. All
filings made in connection with this _Section 8.01(b)_ shall be made in
substantial compliance with the requirements of applicable Law, including any

(c) Except as prohibited by applicable Law or Order, each of the Parties

in connection with any filing or submission with a Governmental Authority
(including if requested by Parent any applicable Competition Law not set forth
in _Section 9.01(e)(ii))_ in connection with the Mergers and in connection
with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority
relating to the Mergers, and consult with each other prior to taking any
material substantive

 



      
 

 



 

position with respect to the filings under the HSR Act or any other
Competition Law in discussions with or filings to be submitted to any
Governmental Authority (ii) keep the other Parties hereto informed in all
material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material
communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the FTC,
the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority and of any material communication
received or given in connection with any Proceeding, in each case regarding
the Mergers or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) to the
extent reasonably practicable, permit the other to review and discuss in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with,
any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals to be submitted to any Governmental Authority with respect to
filings under the HSR Act or any other Competition Law and consult with the

any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Mergers and (iv) coordinate with the other in
preparing and exchanging such information and promptly provide the other (and
its counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations or submissions (and a
summary of any oral presentations) made by such Party with any Governmental
Authority relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
under the HSR Act or any other Competition Law; provided that any such
information or materials referred to in clauses (i) \- (iv) may be redacted
(x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and (y) as
necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege concerns (
_provided_ , that the redacting Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
enter into such joint defense agreements or other arrangements, as
appropriate, so as to allow for such disclosure in a manner that does not
result in the loss of attorney-client or other privilege). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, Parent shall, on behalf of the Parties, have
control over and lead all communications and strategy relating to obtaining
all approvals, consents, waivers, registrations, permits, authorizations and
other confirmations from any Governmental Authority or other Third Party
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Mergers or to any litigation
arising therefrom; _provided, however_ , that Parent shall consult in advance
with the Company and in good faith take the Companys views into account
regarding the overall strategic direction of any such approval process, as
applicable, and consult with the Company prior to taking any material
substantive positions, making dispositive motions or other material
substantive filings or submissions or entering into any negotiations
concerning such approvals, as applicable. The Parties shall take reasonable
efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other
privilege pursuant to this _Section 8.01(c)_ in a manner so as to preserve
the applicable privilege.

 



 

(d) Unless prohibited by applicable Law or Order or by the applicable
Governmental Authority, each of the Company and Parent shall (i) to the extent
reasonably practicable, not participate in or attend any meeting, or engage in
any substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority in respect of the
Mergers (including with respect to any of the actions referred to in _Section
8.01(a)_) without the other, (ii) to the extent reasonably practicable, give
the other reasonable prior notice of any such meeting or conversation and
(iii) in the event one such Party is prohibited by applicable Law or Order or
by the applicable Governmental Authority from participating or attending any
such meeting or engaging in any such conversation, keep such non-participating
Party reasonably apprised with respect thereto; _provided_ , that Parent and
its Representatives may conduct such a meeting or conversation

 



      
 

 



 

without the Company or its Representatives present upon the prior written
consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties
hereto understand and agree that "reasonable best efforts" shall not require
Parent to (i) divest or otherwise hold separate (including by establishing a
trust or otherwise) any businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines,
properties or Contracts or other arrangements or terminate any Contracts or
other arrangements relating to any businesses, assets, equity interests,
product lines or properties of Parent or the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or (ii) accept any conditions or take any other
actions that would apply to, or affect, any businesses, assets, equity
interests, product lines, properties or Contracts or other arrangements of
Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall be obligated to
take the actions described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) if and only
if any such divestiture or divestitures (or agreement or agreements to hold
separate), conditions or other actions do not relate to a development program
or a development-stage product and would not, and would not reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in a one-year loss of
revenues (as measured by fiscal year 2015 revenue) of either the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, in excess of US$325 million. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x)
neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to agree to any material
modification or waiver of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (y)
neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to litigate or participate in
the litigation of any Proceeding involving the Federal Trade Commission or
Department of Justice or similar Governmental Authority, whether judicial or
administrative, in connection with the Mergers or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall not divest,
agree to hold separate, accept any condition or take any other action (whether
or not consistent in scope and magnitude with prior conditions and actions),
or agree or offer to do so, without Parents prior written consent. If so
requested by Parent in connection with Parents compliance with this _Section
8.01_, the Company agrees to, and to cause its Subsidiaries to, assist and
cooperate with Parent and its Affiliates in taking, or causing to be taken
(including by its Subsidiaries), any and all actions with respect to
proposing, negotiating, agreeing to and effecting the sale, divestiture, hold
separate or disposition of, or the accepting of any conditions or taking of
any other actions that would apply to or affect, any businesses, assets,
equity interests, product lines or properties or Contracts or other
arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as may be
required in order to obtain all approvals, consents, waivers, registrations,
permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental
Authority; _provided_ that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be
obligated to consummate any such sale, divestiture, hold separate or
disposition prior to the Closing.

 



 

Section 8.02 _Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Registration Statement_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, (i) the Company shall prepare (with Parents reasonable
cooperation) and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be sent
to the stockholders of the Company relating to the Company Shareholder Meeting
and (ii) Parent shall prepare (with the Companys reasonable cooperation) and
file with the SEC the Registration Statement, in which the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the
registration under the 1933 Act of the Parent Shares to be issued in the First
Merger. Each of the Company and

 



       
 

 



 

Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Registration
Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus comply as to form in all material
respects with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the 1933
Act and the 1934 Act, respectively. Subject to _Section 8.02(d)_ and unless
the Company Board has made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with _Section 8.03_, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include
(A) a statement to the effect that the Company Board has determined that this
Agreement and the First Merger are in the best interests of the Company and
its shareholders and (B) the recommendation of the Company Board in favor of
approval and adoption of this Agreement. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the 1933
Act as promptly as practicable after such filing (including by responding to
comments of the SEC). As promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement shall have become effective, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its
shareholders.

 



 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning
such Person and its Affiliates to the other, and provide such other
assistance, as may be reasonably requested by such other Party to be included
therein and shall otherwise reasonably assist and cooperate with the other in
the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
the Registration Statement, and the resolution of any comments to either
received from the SEC. If at any time prior to the receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or
any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to either the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that either such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, with respect to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated
to the shareholders of the Company.

 



 

(c) The Parties shall notify each other promptly of the receipt of any
comments, whether written or oral, from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of
any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements
to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement or for
additional information and shall (A) supply each other with copies of (i) all
correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, or the Registration Statement and (ii) all stop orders
of the SEC relating to the Registration Statement and (B) provide each other
with a reasonable opportunity to participate in the response to those comments
and requests.

 



 

(d) No amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement will be made by Parent or the Company without the
approval of the other Parties hereto, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned; _provided_ , that the Company, in connection
with a Company Adverse Recommendation Change made in compliance with the terms
hereof may amend or supplement the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including by
incorporation by reference) pursuant to an amendment or

 



      
 

 



 

supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the extent it contains
(i) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) a statement of the reason of
the board for making such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, and (iii)
additional information reasonably related to the foregoing. Notwithstanding a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall nonetheless submit
this Agreement to the Company Shareholders for approval and adoption, unless
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article 10_.

 



 

Section 8.03 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with
any Person that may be ongoing with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal
and, if applicable, shall use reasonable best efforts to have returned to the
Company any confidential information that has been provided to any Person in
any such discussions or negotiations. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the earlier to occur of the First Effective Time or the date
of termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article 10_, the Company
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective
officers, directors and employees not to (and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its Affiliates other Representatives not to),
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing information which has not been previously
publicly disseminated), any inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or offer
which constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) subject to _Section 8.03(b)_, approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, a Company Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) subject to _Section 8.03(b)_, approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any Alternative Acquisition
Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement), (iv) enter
into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding any Company Acquisition Proposal, or (v) agree to do any of the
foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, prior to obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval, the Company receives a bona fide written Company
Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement, which Company
Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this _Section 8.03(a)_,
if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Company Acquisition Proposal is or is reasonably expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and that a failure to take such action with respect to such
Company Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Companys directors under applicable Law, the Company
may, in response to such Company Acquisition Proposal, and subject to
compliance with _Section 8.03(c)_, furnish information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or Persons making such Company
Acquisition Proposal and engage in discussions or negotiations with such
Person or Persons regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,
that (A) the Company, prior to furnishing, or causing to be furnished, any
nonpublic information related to the Company and its Subsidiaries to such
Person or Persons, enters into a confidentiality agreement with the Person or
Persons making such Company Acquisition Proposal that (x) does not contain any
provision that would prevent the Company from complying with its obligation to
provide any disclosure to Parent required pursuant to this _Section 8.03_ and
(y) contains confidentiality provisions no less favorable in the aggregate to
the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement as in effect
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement, except that such
confidentiality agreement need not include explicit or implicit standstill
provisions or otherwise restrict the making of or amendment or modification to
Company Acquisition Proposals (an

 



      
 

 



 

" **Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement** ") and (B) promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) following furnishing any such nonpublic information to
such Person, the Company furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to
the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously so furnished to
Parent or its Representatives).

 



 

(b) Except as permitted pursuant to this _Section 8.03(b)_, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (x) effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or (y) cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
merger agreement or other similar agreement relating to any Company
Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement)
(each an " **Alternative Acquisition Agreement** "); _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not prohibit the disclosure that the Company Board or any
committee thereof has determined that a Company Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, that the Board of Directors of the Company or
any committee thereof intends to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
or that the Company intends to terminate this Agreement to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement and in each case any material facts and
circumstances relating thereto, in each case in compliance with the remaining
provisions of this _Section 8.03(b)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, prior to receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may (1) make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or (2) cause the Company to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal that did
not result from a breach of this _Section 8.03_ and terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)(ii)_, in either case if (and only if): the
Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (i) in the case of
clause (1) where the Company Adverse Recommendation Change is not made in
response to a Company Acquisition Proposal, failure to take such action is
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law and (ii) in the case of (A) clause (1) where such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change is made in response to a Company Acquisition
Proposal or (B) clause (2), such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and the failure to take such action is reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything set forth in this
_Section 8.03(b)_, neither the Company Board, nor any committee thereof, as
applicable, shall take any action set forth in clause (1) or clause (2),
unless (I) the Company Board provides Parent at least five (5) calendar days
prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall
specify the reasons therefor and, if relating to a Company Acquisition
Proposal, include the information with respect to the Superior Proposal that
is specified in _Section 8.03(c)_, as well as a copy of such Company
Acquisition Proposal; (II) during the five (5) calendar days following such
written notice, the Company Board and its Representatives have negotiated in
good faith with Parent, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, regarding
any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby proposed by
Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or other underlying relevant
facts and circumstances with respect to the Company Adverse Recommendation
Change; and (III) at the end of the five (5) calendar day period described in
the foregoing clause (II), the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors
(and taking into account any binding adjustment or modification of the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent), that (x) the Company Acquisition
Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal (or, if the action set forth in
clause (1) does not relate to a Company

 



      
 

 



 

Acquisition Proposal, that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law) and (y) the failure to make
such Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

In the event of any change in the financial terms of or any material amendment
or modification to any Superior Proposal (or, if the action set forth in
clause (1) does not relate to a Company Acquisition Proposal, any material
change to the underlying relevant facts and circumstances), the immediately
preceding proviso shall again apply (but the five (5) calendar day period
shall instead be the longer of (x) two (2) calendar days and (y) the amount of
time remaining in such five (5) calendar day period); _provided_ , _further_ ,
that (aa) whether or not there is a Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Article 10_,
the Company Board shall submit this Agreement for approval by the Company
shareholders at the Company Shareholder Meeting and (bb) in the event the

Section 8.04 _Parent Financing Covenant_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its and their
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to
timely arrange and obtain, on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Financing Commitment Letters, the proceeds of the Debt Financing in an amount
sufficient, together with other financial resources available to Parent, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and make the
payments referred to in _Section 5.10(e)_. In furtherance of the foregoing,
to the extent necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and make the payments referred to in _Section 5.10(e)_, Parent
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to:

 



 

(i) maintain in full force and effect the Financing Commitment Letters in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein,
except to the extent (A) there is a reduction of commitments in accordance
with the terms thereof, (B) any of the commitments under the Financing
Commitment Letters are replaced (dollar for dollar) with Definitive Financing
Agreements or (C) there is a reduction for any amendment or modification or
replacement thereof in accordance with _Section 8.04(c)_ or _Section
8.04(d)_;

 



 

(ii) negotiate, execute and deliver (and use reasonable best efforts to cause
any other parties to the Financing Commitment Letters to negotiate, execute
and deliver) definitive agreements in respect of the facilities contemplated
by the Financing Commitment Letters (the " **Definitive Financing Agreements**
") on the terms and conditions (including, as necessary, "market flex" terms
and conditions) contained in the Financing Commitment Letters; and

 



 

(iii) satisfy on a timely basis all the conditions applicable to Parent to the
funding of the Debt Financing set forth in the Financing Commitment Letter or
Definitive Financing Agreements, as applicable, within Parents control.

 



 

In the event that all conditions set forth in _Section 9.01_ and _Section
9.02_ have been satisfied or waived or, upon funding shall be satisfied or
waived, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing
Source Parties to fund on the Closing Date the Debt Financing, to the extent
the proceeds thereof are required to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and make the payments referred to in _Section 5.10(e)_.

 



 

(b) Upon request, Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed, on a
reasonably current basis, as to the status of the Debt Financing. Parent shall
promptly following execution deliver to the Company copies of any amendment,
modification or replacement of the Financing Commitment Letters (including any
Replacement Financing Commitment Letter) (which may be redacted in a customary
manner).

 



 

(c) Parent shall not, without the consent of the Company (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), amend or modify, or waive
any provision or remedy under, any Financing Commitment Letter or Definitive
Financing Agreement if such amendment, modification or waiver: (i) reduces the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing

 



      
 

 



 

(including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount) unless the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing following such
reduction, together with other financial resources available to Parent
(including amounts funded into an escrow account with release provisions no
less favorable in any material respect to Parent than the conditions precedent
set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters), is sufficient to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and make the payments referred
to in _Section 5.10(e)_ or (ii) expands the conditions or other contingencies
relating to the receipt or funding of the Debt Financing or imposes additional
conditions or other contingencies relating to the receipt or funding of the
Debt Financing, in a manner that in any such case would reasonably be expected
to (1) materially delay or make materially less likely the funding of the Debt
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt Financing) on the
Closing Date, (2) materially adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce
its rights against the Financing Source Parties or any other parties to any
Financing Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing Agreement or (3)
materially adversely affect the ability of Parent to timely consummate the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing Parent may amend the Financing Commitment
Letters to (x) add or replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities, and (y) implement or exercise any
"market flex" provisions contained in the Financing Commitment Letters.

 



 

(d) Replacement Financing.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Parent may
substitute the cash proceeds received by Parent or a wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent (to the extent segregated and limited in use to the consummation of
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated in this Agreement, or
funded into an escrow account with release provisions no less favorable to
Parent in any material respect than the conditions precedent set forth in the
Financing Commitment Letters) from consummated debt or equity offerings or
asset sales for all or any portion of the Debt Financing by reducing
commitments under the Financing Commitment Letters; _provided_ , that the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing following such reduction, together with
other financial resources available to Parent (including amounts funded into
an escrow account with release provisions no less favorable in any material
respect to Parent than the conditions precedent set forth in the Financing
Commitment Letters), is sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and make the payments referred to in _Section 5.10(e)_.

 



 

(ii) If funds in the amounts set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters or
the Definitive Financing Agreements, as applicable, or any portion thereof,
become unavailable, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event to use its or
their reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute financing sufficient,
together with other financial resources available to Parent, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and make the payments referred to
in _Section 5.10(e)_ (any such financing, a " **Substitute Financing** ").

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Parent may
substitute commitments in respect of other financing from the same and/or
alternative third-party financing sources for all or any portion of the Debt
Financing so long as (x) all conditions precedent to the availability of such
financing have been satisfied or are no less favorable in any material respect
to Parent than the conditions precedent set forth in the Financing Commitment
Letters and (y) the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing is not reduced as a
result of such substitution if, as a result of such reduction, such reduced
amount would not be sufficient, together with other financial resources
available to Parent, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and make the payments referred to in _Section 5.10(e)_ (such
financing, the " **Replacement Commitments** ", and together with any
Substitute Financing, the " **Replacement Financing** "; the definitive
documentation for any such Replacement Financing, the " **Replacement
Financing Documents** " and any commitment letter in respect of any such
Replacement Financing, the " **Replacement Financing Commitment Letter** ").

 



 

(iv) In the event any Replacement Financing is obtained, references in this
Agreement to the Debt Financing shall also be deemed to refer to such
Replacement Financing, and references in this Agreement to the Financing
Commitment Letters and the Definitive Financing Agreements shall also be
deemed to refer to the Replacement Financing Commitment Letter and Replacement
Financing Documents, respectively, relating to such Replacement Financing, and
all obligations of Parent pursuant to this _Section 8.04_ shall be applicable
thereto to the same extent as Parents obligations with respect to the Debt
Financing.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 expressly acknowledge and agree that
neither Parents nor Merger Sub 1s nor Merger Sub 2s obligations hereunder
are conditioned in any manner upon Parent or any of its Affiliates obtaining
the Debt Financing, any Replacement Financing or any other financing.

the Depository Trust Company in connection with any consent solicitation that

solicitation); _provided_ , that (1) such cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the operations of the Company

 



      
 

 



 

and its Subsidiaries, (2) the effectiveness of any such Debt Transaction with

be conducted in compliance with applicable Law, including applicable SEC rules
and regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Existing Note Purchase
Agreement, the Existing Term Loan or the Existing Senior Notes Indenture, as
applicable. It is understood and agreed that a failure to obtain the
amendments or consummate any offer or consent solicitation contemplated by the
Debt Transactions (as described above) shall not constitute a failure by the
Company to satisfy its obligations under this _Section 8.05(e)_.

 



 

(ii) Following the commencement of any Debt Transaction, the Company shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, make any change to the terms and
conditions of such Debt Transaction, unless such change is previously approved
by Parent in writing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
or required by applicable Law or the terms and conditions of the Existing Note
Purchase Agreement, Existing Term Loan or the Existing Senior Notes Indenture,
as applicable. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, waive
any of the conditions to such Debt Transaction (other than that the Closing
shall have occurred and that there shall be no Law, injunction or other legal
restraint prohibiting such waiver or consummation of such Debt Transaction) as
may be reasonably requested by Parent and shall not, without the written
consent of Parent, waive any condition to such Debt Transaction other than as
agreed in writing between Parent and the Company.

 



 

(iii) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed, on a reasonably
current basis, as to the status of communications with the holders of the 2017
Private Placement Notes, 2020 Private Placement Notes, Senior Notes or the
agent or lenders under the Existing Term Loan in connection with any Debt
Transaction.

case in form and substance customary for transactions of this type, from the
applicable agent on behalf of the Persons to whom such indebtedness is owed,
which Payoff Letters together with any related release documentation shall,
among other things, include the payoff amount and provide that Liens (and
guarantees), if any, granted in connection with the Company Credit Facilities
or any other indebtedness of the Company to be paid off, discharged and
terminated on the Closing Date relating to the assets, rights and properties
of the Company and its Subsidiaries securing or relating to such indebtedness,
shall, upon the payment of the amount set forth in the applicable Payoff
Letter at or prior to the Effective Time, be released and terminated. The
obligations of the Company pursuant to this _Section 8.05(e)(iv)_ shall be

to the Company at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
the Existing Term Loan shall be deemed one of the Company Credit Facilities.

Medicaid Services or any other third-party payor with respect to any Company
Product, the

 



      
 

 



 

effect of which would reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(c) The delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 8.07_ shall not (i)
affect or be deemed to modify any representation, warranty, covenant, right,
remedy, or condition to any obligation of any Party hereunder or (ii) update
any section of the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter.

 



 

Section 8.08 _Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) Upon reasonable notice, and subject to applicable Law, the Company shall
(and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to Parent and its Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior
notice to the Company during the period prior to the First Effective Time, to
all its and its Subsidiaries properties, books, Contracts, commitments,
records, officers and employees (other than any of the foregoing to the extent
related to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement, or, without
limiting _Section 8.03_, to any Company Acquisition Proposal or any other
transactions potentially competing with or alternative to the Mergers or
proposals from other parties relating to any competing or alternative
transactions) and, during such period as Parent may from time to time
reasonably request, and during such period the Company shall (and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent all other information
concerning it, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective businesses,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ that
Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to
provide such access or information to the extent the Company determines, in
its reasonable judgment, that (i) any Law applicable to the Company (including
any Competition Law) requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to restrict or
prohibit access to any such properties or information, (ii) such disclosure
would result in disclosure of any trade secrets of Third Parties, (iii)
disclosure of any such information or document could result in the loss of
attorney-client or other legal privilege ( _provided_ , that the Company
shall, and shall cause its counsel to, use their reasonable best efforts to
enter into such joint defense agreements or other arrangements, as
appropriate, so as to allow for such disclosure in a manner that does not
result in the loss of attorney client privilege) or (iv) disclosure of any
such information would expose the Company to material risk of liability for
disclosure of sensitive or personal information; _provided_ , _however_ , that
with respect to clauses (i) through (iv) of this _Section 8.08(a)_, the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to develop an
alternative to providing such information so as to address such matters that
is reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company. All requests for
information made pursuant to this _Section 8.08(a)_ shall be directed to a
Person designated by the Company. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement,
Parent will be permitted to disclose such information to any Financing Source
Parties or prospective financing sources that are or may become parties to the
Financing (and, in each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so
long as such information is furnished by Parent subject to customary
confidentiality undertakings in connection with the Financing.

 



 

(b) With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to this Agreement, each
of Parent and the Company shall comply with, and shall cause such Partys
Representatives to

 



      
 

 



 

comply with, all of its obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, which
agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 



 

Section 8.09 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent
and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take all such steps as
may be required to cause any dispositions of Company Shares (including
derivative securities with respect to Company Shares) or acquisitions of
Parent Shares (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Shares)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the 1934 Act with respect to the Company or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the 1934 Act, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Stock Exchange De-listing; 1934 Act Deregistration_. Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Shares to be de-
listed from the NYSE and de-registered under the 1934 Act as soon as
reasonably practicable following the First Effective Time. The Company shall
reasonably cooperate with Parent in connection with the actions contemplated
by this _Section 8.10_.

 



 

Section 8.11 _Shareholder Litigation_. Each Party hereto shall promptly notify
the other Parties hereto in writing of any litigation related to this
Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that is brought (or, to the knowledge of such Party, threatened in
writing) against such Party and/or its directors (any such litigation relating
to the Company and/or directors of the Company, a " **Company Transaction
Litigation** ") and shall keep such other Parties reasonably informed on a
current basis with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate, subject to a customary joint defense
agreement, in the defense or settlement of any Company Transaction Litigation
brought by or on behalf of shareholders against the Company and/or any of its
directors, and the Company shall not settle, agree to any undertakings or
approve or otherwise agree to any waiver that may be sought in connection with
such Company Transaction Litigation, without the prior written consent of
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).
Without limiting in any way the Parties obligations under _Section 8.01_,
each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, cooperate in the defense or settlement of any litigation
contemplated by this _Section 8.11_.

 



 

Section 8.12 _Tax Cooperation_. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the Mergers, taken together, to qualify
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, (ii)
obtain the Tax opinions described in _Section 9.02(e)_ and _Section
9.03(e)_, respectively, and (iii) execute and deliver to counsel for Parent
and the Company the certificates referred to in _Section 9.02(e)_ and
_Section 9.03(e)_, and to cause the statements therein to continue to be true
and correct at all relevant times.

right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 10.01(b)(i)_ shall not

vote taken thereon at the Company Shareholder Meeting (including any

(i) if a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred; or

 



 

(ii) if the Company shall have materially breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the

(d) by the Company:

covenants or agreements under this Agreement, which breach would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 9.02(a)_ or _9.02(b)_ ; or

 



 

(ii) prior to the Company Shareholder Approval, if (A) the Company Board
authorizes the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to a Company Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section 8.03_, (B)

this _Section 10.02_, _Section 10.03_, and _Article 11_ (and the
definitions used in each such section), all of which shall survive such
termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 10.02_
shall relieve any Party from liability for any fraud or knowing, material and
intentional breach of this Agreement, subject to _Section 10.03(c)_. No
termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the Parties
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.03 _Termination Fees_.

 



 

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 10.01(c)(i)_ (or, at the time that this Agreement is terminated,
Parent had the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
10.01(c)(i)_) or by the Company pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)(ii)_, then at
or prior to the termination of this Agreement in the case of a termination
pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)(ii)_, or within two Business Days following
such termination in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section
10.01(c)(i)_ (or if such termination occurred at a time

 



      
 

 



 

that Parent had the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
10.01(c)(i)_), the Company shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, to Parent a fee in the amount of $685,000,000 (the "
**Company Termination Fee** ").

 



 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent
pursuant to _Section 10.01(b)(i)_ or _Section 10.01(b)(iii)_, or by Parent
pursuant to _Section 10.01(c)(ii)_ due to a breach or failure to perform of
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, and (i) at any time after
the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination (in the case of a
termination pursuant to _Section 10.01(b)(i)_ or _Section 10.01(c)(ii)_) or
prior to the completion of the Company Shareholder Meeting (including any
adjournment or postponement thereof) (in the case of a termination pursuant to
_Section 10.01(b)(iii)_), a Company Acquisition Proposal shall either (x)
have been made or communicated to the Company Board (in the case of a
termination pursuant to _Section 10.01(c)(ii)_ due to a breach or failure to
perform of covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or a
termination pursuant to _Section 10.01(b)(i)_) and not withdrawn without
qualification prior to such termination (provided, that, in the case of a
breach or failure to perform a covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement, such withdrawal shall have taken place prior to such breach or
failure) or (y) have been publicly announced or publicly made known and not
publicly withdrawn without qualification (1) prior to such termination (in the
case of a termination pursuant to _Section 10.01(b)(i)_), (2) prior to the
Company Shareholder Meeting (including any adjournment or postponement
thereof) (in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 10.01(b)(iii)_)
or (3) prior to such breach or failure to perform (in the case of a
termination pursuant to _Section 10.01(c)(ii)_ due to a breach or failure to
perform of covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement) and (ii)
within twelve months after such termination, the Company shall have entered
into a definitive agreement with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal,
or any Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated (in each case,
whether or not such Company Acquisition Proposal is the same as the original
Company Acquisition Proposal made, communicated or publicly made known or
publicly announced), then, in any such event, the Company shall pay, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, to Parent the Company Termination Fee
on the earlier to occur of the Companys entry into an agreement with respect
to such Company Acquisition Proposal or the consummation of such Company
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of the
definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" in this _Section 10.03(b)_,
references to "15%" shall be replaced by "50%."

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
the Company Termination Fee is paid to Parent in circumstances for which such
fee is payable pursuant to _Section 10.03(a)_ or _Section 10.03(b)_, other
than with respect to claims for, or arising out of or in connection with fraud
or knowing, intentional and material breach of any covenant in this Agreement,
payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of Parent, its
stockholders and their respective Representatives against the Company and its
Representatives for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Mergers to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or
otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company or its
Representatives or Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Mergers or transactions
contemplated by this Agreement except as specified above. Any Termination Fee
paid by the Company to Parent pursuant to this Agreement shall be offset
against any award for damages awarded to Parent pursuant to any

 



      
 

 



 

claim based on fraud or knowing, intentional and material breach of this
Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 10.03(c)_ shall modify _Section 11.04._

 



 

(d) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
10.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due
pursuant to this _Section 10.03_, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for any
amount due pursuant to this _Section 10.03_, the Company shall pay Parent its
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount due pursuant
to this _Section 10.03_ from the date such payment was required to be made
until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in _The Wall
Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.
All payments under this _Section 10.03_ shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent. In
no event shall the Company Termination Fee be payable more than once.

certificate, instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement
shall survive the First Effective Time. This _Section 11.01_ shall not limit

Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after any vote of the shareholders of the Company or Parent
contemplated hereby, by written agreement of the Parties hereto at any time
prior to the Closing Date with respect to any of the terms contained herein;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after the Company Shareholder Approval has been
obtained there shall be no amendment or waiver that would require the further
approval of the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law without such

or waiver of any DFS Provision that is materially adverse to the Financing
Source Parties shall be effective without the written consent of the Financing
Source Parties.

by applicable Law, no waiver of this Agreement shall require the approval of
the shareholders of either Parent or the Company. Any agreement on the part of
a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any

constitute a waiver of such rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise
by any Party of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or
further exercise of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement.

Section 11.06 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, it
being understood that each Party need not sign the same counterpart. This
Agreement shall become effective when each Party hereto shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed by all of the other Parties hereto. Signatures to
this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in
"portable document format" (".pdf") form, or by any other electronic means
intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a
document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document
bearing the original signature.

 



 

Section 11.07 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and the documents and the
instruments referred to herein), the Confidentiality Agreement and any
agreements entered into contemporaneously herewith (a) constitute the entire
agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof ( _provided_ that any provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
conflicting with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be superseded by this Agreement) and (b) are not intended to confer any
rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities upon any Person other
than the Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns;
_provided_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing clause (b), following the
First Effective Time, (i) the provisions of _Section 7.04_ shall be
enforceable by each Party entitled to indemnification hereunder and his or her
heirs and his or her representatives, (ii) the right of the Companys
shareholders to receive the Merger Consideration shall be enforceable by such
holders, (iii) the rights of the holders of Company Options, Company RSU
Awards and Company Restricted Share Awards to receive such amounts as provided
for in _Section 2.12_ shall be enforceable by such holders and (iv) the
provisions of _Section 8.05(c)_ shall be enforceable by each Party entitled
to reimbursement and indemnification thereunder; _provided_ , further that the
Financing Source Parties shall be express third-party beneficiaries with
respect to the last proviso of _Section 11.02_, this proviso in this

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 11.07_, _Section 11.10(b)_, _Section 11.11(c)_, _Section 11.12_
and _Section 11.13 _(collectively, the " **DFS Provisions** ").

 



 

Section 11.08 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy,
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as the economic and legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby, taken as a whole, are not affected in
a manner materially adverse to any Party hereto. Upon such a determination,
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 11.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
hereto in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any such assignment
without such consent shall be null and void; _provided_ , that, with the prior
written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), Parent may designate, prior to the First Effective Time, another
wholly owned Subsidiary to be a Party to the Mergers in lieu of Merger Sub 1
and/or Merger Sub 2, in which event all references herein to Merger Sub 1
and/or Merger Sub 2, as applicable, shall be deemed references to such other
Subsidiary (except with respect to representations and warranties made herein
with respect to Merger Sub 1 and/or Merger Sub 2, as applicable, as of the
date of this Agreement) and all representations and warranties made herein
with respect to Merger Sub 1 and/or Merger Sub 2, as applicable, as of the
date of this Agreement shall also be made with respect to such other
Subsidiary as of the date of such designation (with such modifications as
necessary to reflect any different organizational form of such other
Subsidiary); _provided further_ , that such assignment shall not relieve
Parent of its obligations hereunder or otherwise enlarge, alter or change any
obligation of any other Party hereto or due to Parent or such other
Subsidiary. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

Section 11.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed
in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to
the principles of conflicts of law thereof or of any other jurisdiction that
would result in the application of the Laws of any other jurisdiction, except
that, notwithstanding the foregoing , (a) the interpretation of the duties of
directors of the Company and, to the extent required by the Laws of the State
of Minnesota, the Mergers shall be governed and construed in accordance with
the Laws of the State of Minnesota without giving effect to the principles of
conflicts of law thereof or of any other jurisdiction that would result in the
application of the Laws of any other jurisdiction and (b) subject in all
respects to the provisions of any other agreement (including any commitment
letter or definitive agreement relating to any Financing) between any
Financing Source Party and any Party hereto, all matters relating to any
action or claim against any Financing Source Party, and all matters relating
to the interpretation, construction, validity and enforcement (whether at law,
in equity, in contract, in tort, or otherwise) against any of the Financing
Source Parties in any way relating to the Financing Commitment Letters or the
performance thereof or the Financing,

 



      
 

 



 

shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
domestic Law of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule whether of the State of New York or any
other jurisdiction that would cause the application of Law of any jurisdiction
other than the State of New York.

 



 

Section 11.11 _Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the

Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement without proof of actual damages or otherwise

remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

(b) In addition, each of the Parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself, and
hereby submits itself, to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery

arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, and agrees not to plead or claim any objection to the laying of venue
in any such court or that any judicial Proceeding in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (or, solely if such court declines jurisdiction, any federal court
located in the State of Delaware), and (iv) consents to service of process
being made through the notice procedures set forth in _Section 11.05_.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party
agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing
Source Parties in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York, or, if under applicable law jurisdiction is vested in the Federal
courts, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (and of
the appropriate appellate courts therefrom).

 



 

Section 11.12 _Waiver of Claims Against Financing Source Parties_. The Company
agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that none of the Financing
Source Parties shall have any liability to the Company or its Affiliates
(other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
financing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and that neither the Company nor
any of its Affiliates (other than

 



      
 

 



 

Parent and its Subsidiaries) will have any rights or claims against any
Financing Source Parties under this Agreement and any other agreement
contemplated by, or entered into in connection with, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any commitments by the Financing
Source Parties in respect of financing the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
