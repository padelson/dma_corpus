(ii) to one or more accounts designated by Sellers in writing two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an

(b) Buyer shall retain, in accordance with Section 2.08, the Indemnity
Holdback Amount.

(c) Buyer shall retain, in accordance with Section 2.09, the NET Mexico

Section 2.07 Net Working Capital Adjustments.

(a) Estimated Closing Statement. Not later than three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing, Sellers shall deliver to Buyer a written closing statement
(the "Estimated Closing Statement") setting forth (i) the Closing Indebtedness
and (ii) their good faith estimate of the Net Working Capital as of the
Measurement Time (the "Estimated Net Working Capital"), together with a
reasonably detailed explanation and supporting detail of the calculation
thereof. The Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared consistently with
Schedule B and shall be prepared in good faith. If between the Signing Date
and the Closing Date, Sellers close any books of the Company Group, Seller
must promptly provide Buyer with updated calculations based on Schedule B
reflecting the updated Net Working Capital. Each such interim update must be
prepared consistently with Schedule B attached hereto. If the Estimated Net
Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working Capital, the Cash Payment
shall be reduced by the amount of such difference, and that if the Estimated
Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Net Working Capital, the Cash
Payment shall be increased by the amount of such difference.

(b) Final Net Working Capital. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall cause to be prepared consistently with Schedule B and in good
faith and delivered to the Sellers' Representative, a final proposed
calculation of the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date ("Final Net
Working Capital Proposal"). The Final Net Working Capital Proposal shall be
accompanied by any supporting documentation or other materials reasonably
requested by Sellers. If the Sellers' Representative does not object in
writing to the Final Net Working Capital Proposal within thirty (30) days
after receipt of same, then the Final Net Working Capital Proposal shall be
deemed to have been accepted by the Sellers' Representative and shall become
final and binding. If the Sellers' Representative timely objects in writing to
the Final Net Working Capital Proposal, then the Sellers' Representative and
Buyer shall use reasonable good faith efforts to resolve the dispute within
thirty (30) days. If the Sellers' Representative and Buyer are unable to reach
an agreement within such thirty (30)‑day period, then they shall submit the
dispute to Ernest and Young or such other nationally recognized accounting firm,
mutually agreeable to the Sellers' Representative and Buyer (the "Neutral
Arbitrator"), whose determination of the Net Working Capital as of the
Measurement Time shall be made in accordance with this Section 2.07(b) and
shall be final and binding. In submitting a dispute to the Neutral Arbitrator
under this Section 2.07(b), each party shall prepare a detailed statement in
support of their respective calculation of the Net Working Capital as of the
Measurement Time. The Neutral Arbitrator shall be required to accept any
determinations for which there is agreement between the Sellers' 

Representative and Buyer, and will only decide upon matters on which there is
a substantive dispute, which shall be decided based only upon the provisions
of this Section 2.07(b) and the presentations by the Sellers' Representative
and Buyer (and not upon an independent review). The Neutral Arbitrator will
not decide any amount in dispute to be less than the lesser of the amount
claimed by either the Sellers' Representative or Buyer, or to be greater than
the greater of the amount claimed by either the Sellers' Representative or
Buyer. The Sellers and the Buyer shall each pay one-half of the Neutral
Arbitrator's fees and expenses in connection with this Section 2.07(b);
provided, however, that (i) if the aggregate estimate by Buyer of the disputed
amount or amounts differs by ten percent (10%) or more from the determination
of the Neutral Arbitrator, then Buyer shall pay the entire amount of such
cost, and (ii) if the aggregate estimate by the Sellers' Representative of the
disputed amount or amounts differs by ten percent (10%) or more from the
determination of the Neutral Arbitrator, then Sellers shall pay the entire
amount of such cost; provided, further, however, if the aggregate estimates by
Buyer and the Sellers' Representative of the disputed amount or amounts
differs by ten percent (10%) or more from the determination of the Neutral
Arbitrator, then the party whose estimate differs most greatly from the
determination of the Neutral Arbitrator shall pay the entire amount of such
cost. The value of the Net Working Capital established pursuant to this
Section 2.07(b) shall be referred to as the "Final Net Working Capital."

(c) If the Final Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Net Working
Capital, the Sellers shall pay the amount of such difference to Buyer based on
their respective Pro Rata Shares. If the Final Net Working Capital is greater
than the Estimated Net Working Capital, Buyer shall pay the amount of such
difference to the Sellers' Representative. The parties shall make any
deliveries or payment required by this Section 2.07(c) within five (5)
Business Days after the earlier to occur of the date (i) the parties agree in
writing as to the Final Net Working Capital or (ii) the Neutral Arbitrator
notifies the parties in writing of its determination of the Final Net Working
Capital according to the provisions of this Section 2.07(c). Any payment made
pursuant to this Section 2.07(c) shall be treated for all purposes as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price.

Section 2.08 Release of Indemnity Holdback Amount.

(a) Subject to Section 6.05(f), Buyer shall hold the Indemnity Holdback Amount
in accordance with the terms and conditions contained herein until the date
that is eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date (such date, the
"Indemnity Holdback Release Date"), as security for the Sellers'
indemnification obligations under Article XI of this Agreement.

(b) Subject to Section 6.05(f), the Indemnity Holdback Amount shall be
applied, subject to the conditions and limitations provided for in Article XI,
(i) to satisfy any indemnification obligations of Sellers under Article XI
arising from or relating to Agreed Claims, and (ii) to secure indemnification
obligations of the Sellers arising from or relating to Claims as to which
Buyer shall have notified the Sellers' Representative in accordance with
Article XI and which are not Agreed Claims (such Claims, "Pending Claims"). 



(c) Subject to Section 6.05(f), on the Indemnity Holdback Release Date, Buyer
shall pay to the Sellers' Representative an amount (the "Net Indemnity
Holdback Amount") equal to (i) the Indemnity Holdback Amount, less (ii) the
aggregate amount of all Agreed Claims retained by Buyer pursuant to Section
11.07 ("Retained Indemnity Amounts"), less (iii) the amounts of any Pending
Claims. Notwithstanding the Indemnity Holdback Release Date, Buyer shall be
entitled to retain, and shall have no obligation to pay to the Sellers'
Representative or any other Person, the Retained Indemnity Amounts, and Buyer
shall retain possession of that portion of the Indemnity Holdback Amount that
equals the total amount of any Pending Claims until any such Pending Claims
are resolved pursuant to the terms hereof. Once all such Pending Claims have
been finally resolved pursuant to the terms hereof, Buyer shall deliver to the
Sellers' Representative the remainder of the Net Indemnity Holdback Amount (if
any) not retainable by a Buyer Indemnitee to satisfy Agreed Claims upon
resolution of such Pending Claims and shall be entitled to retain, as Retained
Indemnity Amounts, any portion of the Net Indemnification Holdback Amount
required to satisfy any amounts payable to any Buyer Indemnitee with respect
to any such Pending Claims that have been resolved as Agreed Claims.

Section 2.09 NET Mexico Expansion Holdback Amount. In order to secure the
value associated with the proposed NET Mexico Expansion Projects, Buyer has
retained the NET Mexico Expansion Holdback Amount at Closing, which such
amount shall be paid, in whole or in part, subject to and in accordance with
the terms and conditions set forth in Exhibit C. For the avoidance of doubt,
in no event shall Buyer be obligated to pay any amount under this Section 2.09
in excess of the NET Mexico Expansion Holdback Amount.

Company Interests may be transferred, except pursuant to an effective
registration statement or an applicable exemption from registration under the
1933 Act. Buyer is an "accredited investor" as defined under Rule 501
promulgated under the 1933 Act.

Section 5.06 Financial Resources; Solvency.

(a) On the Closing Date, Buyer will have sufficient cash, available lines of
credit or other sources of immediately available funds to enable it to pay the
Purchase Price and to otherwise perform its obligations under this Agreement.
Buyer has delivered to the Sellers a true and complete copy of the executed
Commitment Letter. The Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified in
any manner prior to the date of this Agreement. Neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates has entered into any agreement, side letter or other arrangement
relating to the financing of the Purchase Price or transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, other than as set forth in the Commitment Letter and the
fee letters related thereto, a copy of which fee letter has been provided to
the Sellers in a redacted form removing only those terms related to fees
payable on the Closing Date to a Financing Source. The commitment contained in
the Commitment Letter has not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. The
Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and represents a valid, binding
and enforceable obligation of Buyer's Affiliate that is party to the
Commitment Letter and, to Buyer's knowledge, each other party thereto, to
provide the financing contemplated thereby subject only to the satisfaction or
waiver of the Financing Conditions and, subject to the Remedies Exception.
Buyer or its Affiliate has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all
commitment fees and other amounts that are due and payable on or prior to the
date of this Agreement in connection with the Debt Financing. No event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach or default on the part of Buyer or, to Buyer's knowledge,
any other party thereto under the Commitment Letter. Buyer has no reason to
believe that it or any other party thereto will be unable to satisfy on a
timely basis any term of the Commitment Letter. There are no conditions
precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing,
other than the Financing Conditions. The only conditions precedent related to
the funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date that will be included in
the Debt Financing Documents shall be the Financing Conditions contained in
the Commitment Letter. Buyer has no reason to believe that (i) any of the
Financing Conditions will not be satisfied or (ii) the Financing will not be
made available to Buyer on the Closing Date.

(b) Immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Company Group) shall be
able to pay their respective debts as they become due, and own property having
a fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay its debts
(including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities).
Immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Company Group) shall have
adequate capital to carry on their respective businesses. No transfer of
property is being made 

and no obligation is being incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud
either present or future creditors of Buyer, the Company Group or any of their
respective Affiliates.

(c) Buyer understands and agrees that Buyer's obligations to effect and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not subject to
the availability to Buyer of financing.

Section 5.07 Broker's Commissions. Buyer has not, directly or indirectly,
entered into any Contract with any Person that would obligate Sellers, the
Company Group Members, or any of their respective Affiliates to pay any
commission, brokerage fee, or "finder's fee" in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.08 Buyer Filings. Buyer has filed all reports and other documents
required to be filed by Buyer under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"), since January 1, 2012 (the foregoing materials, including the
exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein being
collectively referred to herein as the "SEC Reports") on a timely basis. The
SEC Reports comply in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act.

Down, or as otherwise set forth in Section 6.01(a) of the Disclosure Schedule,
during the Interim Period, (x) Sellers shall cause each of the Company Group

any Company Group Member);

(vii) settle, cancel, or compromise any debt or claim or any Action against

nature of the claims involved or the scope of their applicability to the
Company Group's operations) to involve amounts in excess of $1,000,000 in
value, or where the amount paid in settlement does not exceed the amount
reserved against such matter in the Financial Statements (or the notes

Contract; or

(xiv) agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

(b) Notwithstanding the other provisions of Section 6.01, during the Interim
Period, the Company Group may take commercially reasonable actions with
respect to emergency situations; provided that Sellers must provide Buyer with
prompt written notice of such actions taken as soon as reasonably practicable.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.01(a) to the contrary, in the event
that Sellers or any Company Group Member requests the consent of Buyer (which
such request may be made in writing or by email) to (i) enter into any
Contract that if entered into prior to the date of this Agreement would be
required to be listed as a Material Contract, (ii) materially amend or change
the terms of any Material Contract or (iii) enter into, perform or settle any
Trading Contract, in each case, in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited
pursuant to Section 6.01(a) without Buyer's consent, Buyer shall have five (5)
Business Days from its receipt of notice thereof from the Sellers to inform
the Sellers of its decision to provide such consent. In the event Buyer fails
to inform Sellers of such decision within such period, Buyer shall be deemed
to have consented to, and Sellers shall have no Liability under this Section
6.01 with respect to, the taking of such action by Sellers or the Company
Group Members, as applicable.

(d) For purposes of clarification, nothing contained in this Section 6.01 is
intended to give Buyer, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct
the operations of the Company or any other Company Group Member prior to the
Closing. Subject to the other provisions of this Section 6.01, prior to the
Closing, Sellers, the Company, and the other Company Group Members shall
exercise complete control and supervision over the Company Group's operations.

Section 6.02 Access of Buyer.

(a) During the Interim Period, Sellers shall, and shall cause the Company
Group to, provide Buyer and its Representatives with reasonable access, upon
reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, to the Company
Group's assets, properties, Books and Records, and Representatives who have
significant responsibility for the Company Group's assets, but only to the
extent that such access (i) does not unreasonably interfere with the Company
Group's business or the safe commercial operations of the Company Group, and
(ii) is reasonably related to Buyer's obligations and rights hereunder;
provided, however, that (A) Sellers shall have the right to have a
Representative of Sellers present for any communication with the Company
Group's Representatives; (B) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Representatives
to, observe and comply with all material health, safety, and security
requirements of the Company Group; and (C) neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates or Representatives, shall conduct any environmental site
assessment, compliance evaluation or investigation with respect to any of the
Company Group Members without the prior written consent of Sellers (which may
be provided or withheld in Sellers' sole discretion) and without ongoing
consultation with Sellers with respect to any such activity (it being
understood and agreed that in no event shall any subsurface investigation or
testing of any environmental media be conducted). Buyer shall hold in
confidence all such information on the terms and subject to the conditions
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (and though such Confidentiality
Agreement was executed by an Affiliate of 

Buyer, then Buyer hereby agrees to be bound by and to comply with the terms
and conditions of such Confidentiality Agreement as if Buyer was party
thereto). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not have any right of
access to, and none of Sellers, any Company Group Member, or any of their
Affiliates shall have any obligation to provide any information, the
disclosure of which (1) would reasonably be expected to jeopardize any
privilege (including attorney-client privilege) available to Sellers, any
Company Group Member, or any of their respective Affiliates, (2) would cause
Sellers, any Company Group Member or their Affiliates to breach any fiduciary
duty or Contract to which they are a party, or (3) would result in a violation
of Law. No investigation by Buyer or other information received by Buyer shall
operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty, or
agreement given or made by any Seller in this Agreement.

(b) Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Sellers, the Company Group,
their Affiliates, and any of their respective Representatives for any and all
liabilities, Losses, costs, or expenses incurred by Sellers, the Company
Group, any of their Affiliates, or their respective Representatives arising
out of the access rights under this Section 6.02, including any Action by any
of Buyer's or its Affiliates' Representatives for any injuries or material
property damage while accessing any assets or properties of the Company Group,
except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
Sellers or any Company Group Member.

Section 6.03 Regulatory and Other Approvals.

(a) Each of Buyer and Sellers shall submit as soon as reasonably practicable,
but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Signing Date,
filings under the HSR Act to the extent required. The Persons making such
filings shall request early termination of any applicable HSR Act waiting
period, shall promptly furnish each other with copies of any notices,
correspondence, or other written communication (and a written memorandum
setting forth the substance of any material oral communication) received from
the relevant Governmental Authority, shall promptly make any necessary or
advisable subsequent or supplemental filings or submissions required or
requested by the relevant Governmental Authority and shall, to the extent
reasonably necessary and appropriate, cooperate with one another in the
preparation of such filings or submissions.

(b) In addition to HSR Approval, Sellers, the Company Group, and Buyer shall
(and shall each cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives to) use
its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain all material Consents and
material approvals of third parties and Governmental Authorities that any of
Sellers, the Company Group, and Buyer, or their respective Affiliates are
required to obtain in order to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. If any material Consent necessary to preserve any right or benefit
under any Material Contract to which the Company Group is a party is not
obtained prior to the Closing, Sellers shall, subsequent to the Closing,
cooperate with Buyer and the Company Group in attempting to obtain such
material Consent as promptly thereafter as practicable. If such material
Consent cannot be obtained, Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to
provide Buyer or the Company Group, as applicable, with the rights and
benefits of the affected Material Contract for the term thereof, and, if
Sellers provide such rights and benefits, Buyer or the Company Group, as
applicable, shall assume all obligations and burdens thereunder. 



(c) Subject to applicable confidentiality restrictions or restrictions
required by applicable Law and any matter protected by the attorney-client
privilege or work-product privilege, each Party shall notify the other Party
promptly upon the receipt by such Party or its Affiliates of any communication
from any Governmental Authority regarding (i) any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or by the other Transaction Documents in connection with
any filings made pursuant to this Section 6.03 and any request by any
officials of any Governmental Authority for amendments or supplements to any
filings made pursuant to any Laws of any Governmental Authority or answers to
any questions, or the production of any documents, relating to an
investigation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents by any Governmental Authority and (ii) any Action
pending, or to its knowledge, threatened, which challenges the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. Whenever any event occurs that is required to
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to this
Section 6.03, each Party shall inform the other Party of such occurrence as
soon as reasonably practicable and reasonably cooperate with the other Party
in filing promptly with the applicable Governmental Authority such amendment
or supplement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party
shall provide to the other Party (or its advisors), upon request, copies of
all communications (and a written memorandum setting forth the substance of
any oral communication) between such Party and any Governmental Authority
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any
disclosure which is not permitted by Law or any disclosure containing
confidential information and any matter protected by the attorney-client
privilege or work-product privilege). The Parties may, as they deem advisable
and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the
others under this Section 6.03 as subject to limited access by a Governmental
Authority and parties to a proceeding before a Governmental Authority (such as
"outside counsel only" with respect to such parties). Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the Government Authority
and outside counsel of the recipient or other outside advisors of the
recipient who are subject to a protective order or similar confidentiality
obligation, and shall not be disclosed by such outside counsel and other
permitted Persons to employees, officers, directors, agents, or other
Representatives of the recipient without the advance written consent of the
Party providing such materials. In addition, to the extent reasonably
practicable, each Party shall give notice to, and consult in advance with, the
other Party with respect to any meeting, discussion, appearance, or contact
with any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any Governmental
Authority, with such notice being sufficient to provide the other Party with
the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, discussion,
appearance, or contact, and no Party shall enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Authority without the express written approval of the other
Party. Subject to applicable Law, the Parties shall reasonably consult and
cooperate with each other prior to making or submitting, and permit the other
Party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views
of the other Party in connection with, any analyses, discussions, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, proposals, and other materials
made or submitted to any Governmental Authority regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents by or on
behalf of any Party. 



(d) Buyer acknowledges that for purposes of this Section 6.03 and Section 6.04
only, for purposes of using its "commercially reasonable efforts," the Parties
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to (i) consult and
fully cooperate with and provide reasonable assistance to the other Party
(including providing all documents and information necessary or required) in
obtaining all necessary Consents or other permission or action by, and giving
all necessary notices to and making all necessary filings with and
applications and submissions to, any Governmental Authority or other Person,
and (ii) promptly take, in order to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, all actions necessary
to (A) secure the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period
from a Governmental Authority, (B) resolve any objections asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents raised by any Governmental Authority (including by
defending against all Actions challenging this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby), and (C) prevent the entry of any Order or to have any such
Order vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned that would prevent, prohibit,
restrict, or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents. The Parties shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, respond to and seek to resolve as
promptly as reasonably practicable any objections asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the other Transaction Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be construed so as to require a Party, or
any of its respective Affiliates, without its written consent, to (y) sell,
license, dispose of, hold separate, or operate in any specified manner (or
alter its business or commercial practices respecting) any of its respective
assets or businesses (or to agree to any of the foregoing), or (z) enter into
any consent decree, Order, or agreement that in any way limits the right of
Buyer to own, operate, or retain all or any portion of Buyer's or the Company
Group's assets or businesses or Buyer's freedom of action with respect thereto
or to otherwise receive the full benefits of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of
this Agreement, Buyer shall have ultimate decision-making authority with
regard to any discussions, submissions, negotiations and other communications
with all Governmental Authorities in connection with any Action involving
antitrust or competition issues in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent practicable, Buyer shall provide
the Sellers' Representative with a reasonable opportunity to provide the
Sellers' point of view on such issues, and Buyer shall consider such point of
view in good faith in exercising its decision-making authority under this
Section 6.03.

(e) Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of all filing fees under the
HSR Act.

Section 6.04 Fulfillment of Conditions to Closing.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and applicable Law,
each Party agrees to, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable under 

applicable Law, or otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents as soon as
reasonably practicable (and in any event prior to the Outside Date), including
such actions or things as any other Party may reasonably request in order to
cause any of the conditions to such other Party's obligation to consummate
such transactions specified in Article VII and Article VIII to be fully
satisfied.

(b) The Parties shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to,
take any action inconsistent with their obligations under this Agreement or,
without prejudice to each Party's rights under this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents, which would reasonably be expected to materially hinder
or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the other Transaction Documents or receipt of any required approvals from
any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.

Section 6.05 Employees; Benefit Plans.

(a) As of the Closing, Sellers will cause the termination of employment of
each employee of the Company Group and NET Trading. No later than ten (10)
days prior to the Closing, subject to applicable employment policies of Buyer
and its Affiliates, including policies with respect to background checks and
drug screening, a Buyer Affiliate ("Employer Affiliate") shall offer
employment, effective as of the Closing, in its sole discretion, to any one or
more individuals who were employees of the Company Group or NET Trading
immediately prior to the Closing ("Transferred Employees"). During the period
commencing at the Closing and ending on the date that is the earlier of twelve
(12) months from the Closing and the date of the Transferred Employee's
separation from employment with the Employer Affiliate (or any other Affiliate
of Buyer) for any reason, Employer Affiliate shall provide each Transferred
Employee with: (i) base salary or hourly wages that are no less than the base
salary or hourly wages provided by the Company Group immediately prior to the
Closing; (ii) target bonus opportunities that are no less than the target
bonus opportunities, if any, provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer
or its Affiliates as of the Closing; and (iii) retirement and welfare benefits
that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the most favorable to such
Transferred Employee of those benefits that Buyer or its Affiliates provide to
its similarly situated employees as of the Closing.

(b) With respect to any Employee Benefit Plans, arrangements and
employment‑related entitlements (including under any applicable pension,
401(k), savings, medical, dental, life insurance, vacation, long-service leave
or other leave entitlements, post-retirement health and life insurance,
termination indemnity, severance or separation pay plans) provided, sponsored,
maintained or contributed to by Buyer or its Affiliates (collectively, "Buyer
Benefit Plans") in which any Transferred Employee will participate effective
as of the Closing, Buyer shall cause Employer Affiliate to recognize all
service of the Transferred Employees with the Company Group and any
predecessor employer as if such service were with Buyer and its Affiliates for
all purposes (including for purposes of eligibility to participate, level of
benefits, early retirement eligibility and early retirement subsidies,
vesting, and benefit accrual); provided, however, that (i) such service shall
not be recognized to the extent that (A) such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits for the same period of service, or (B) such service
was not recognized under the corresponding Employee Benefit Plan, and (ii)
Buyer and its Affiliates shall not be required to recognize such service for
benefit accrual purposes under any Buyer Benefit Plan that is a defined
benefit pension plan or service prior to April 1, 1997 for purposes of
eligibility for retiree benefits provided to certain grandfathered employees
of Affiliates of Buyer. 

(c) Sellers shall take all required actions to cause any Employee Benefit Plan
(including any applicable pension, 401(k), savings, medical, dental, life
insurance, long and short term disability, vacation, long service leave, or
other leave entitlements, post-retirement health and life insurance,
termination indemnity, severance, or separation pay plans) provided,
sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Sellers or Company Group to be
terminated effective prior to the Closing Date.

(d) With respect to any employee benefit welfare plan maintained by Buyer or
its Affiliates (collectively, "Buyer Welfare Benefit Plans") in which any
employee of the Company Group will participate effective as of the Closing,
Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company Group or applicable Affiliate to: (i)
waive all pre-existing condition limitations, waiting period provisions,
payments required to avoid a waiting period, actively-at-work requirements,
and any other restriction that would prevent immediately or full participation
by any such employee, and (ii) give effect to claims incurred, amounts paid by
and amounts reimbursed to employees of the Company Group prior to the Closing
when determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limits under the
Buyer Welfare Benefit Plans; provided that Sellers shall provide Buyer with a
list setting forth all such amounts applicable to each employee.

(e) This Section 6.05 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.05,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.05. Nothing
contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed to establish, amend,
or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement, or arrangement. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this Section 6.05 shall not
create any right of any employee or any other Person to any continued
employment with the Company Group, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates
or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

(f) As an incentive for Sellers to encourage the Key Management Members and a
certain number of other employees of the Company Group to remain employed by
the Employer Affiliate after the Closing Date, the Purchase Price shall be
subject to adjustment pursuant to this Section 6.05(f) depending on how many
employees and Key Management Members continue to provide services after the
Closing.

(i) Subject to the limitations set forth below, Buyer shall be entitled to
retain the Retention Holdback if (A) more than fifty percent (50%) of the
employees of the Company Group that are provided employment by the Employer
Affiliate immediately following the Closing Date, voluntarily resign their
employment without Good Reason or are terminated by the Employer Affiliate
with Cause on or before the first anniversary of the Closing Date, or (B) any
of the Key Management Members voluntarily resigns from their employment
without Good Reason or are terminated by the Employer Affiliate with Cause on
or before the earlier to occur of (x) the expiration of the NET Mexico
Expansion Period, (y) the NET Mexico Expansion Holdback Payment (as defined in
Exhibit C) pursuant to Section 2.09, or (z) the Indemnity Release Date. For
the avoidance of doubt, if neither of the conditions set forth in subsections
(A) and (B) are triggered, then the Retention Holdback shall remain a part of
the Indemnity Holdback. 



(ii) The Retention Holdback shall be payable as follows:

(A) If the Retention Holdback becomes payable to Buyer pursuant to this
Section 6.05(f), then Buyer shall retain possession of the Retention Holdback,
and the Indemnity Holdback Amount shall be reduced accordingly; provided, that
in the event that the Retention Holdback becomes payable to Buyer, but the
Indemnity Holdback Amount has otherwise been exhausted by Claims pursuant to
Article XI, then Buyer shall have no further recourse against Sellers.

(B) If the Retention Holdback becomes payable to Sellers pursuant to this
Section 6.05(f), it shall remain part of the Indemnity Holdback Amount, and
shall otherwise be subject to Claims pursuant to Article XI and distributable
in accordance with Article XI and Section 2.08.

(iii) Any payments pursuant to this Section 6.05(f) shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price.

Section 6.06 WARN Obligation. To the extent that any obligations under the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. Section 2101 et.
seq., the regulations and rules thereunder, or under any similar provision of
any federal, state, foreign or local law, rule or regulation (collectively, a
"WARN Obligation") arise with respect to any loss of employment by any
employee of the Company Group in connection with or as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether on or after the Closing,
Buyer shall be solely responsible for such WARN Obligation and any associated
obligations.

Section 6.07 Resignation and Removal. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, effective as of the Closing Date, Sellers shall
cause or accept the resignation or removal of all managers, directors or
officers (in their capacity as such), as applicable, of any Company Group
Member other than those who are identified in a written notice delivered by
Buyer to the Company at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing;
provided, however, that in no event shall this Section 6.07 obligate the
Sellers to cause or accept the resignation or removal of any managers,
directors or officers, as applicable, of NET Mexico nominated or appointed by
MGI Enterprises to such position.

Section 6.08 Replacement of Letters of Credit. At Buyer's sole risk, cost, and
expense, prior to the Closing: (a) Buyer shall take all steps reasonably
necessary and Sellers shall cooperate (it being understood that such
cooperation shall not include any requirement to pay any consideration or
offer or grant any financial accommodation) with Buyer, to ensure that,
effective as of the Closing, (i) Sellers and their Affiliates (other than any
Company Group Member) shall be released from one-hundred percent (100%) of the
obligations or Liabilities relating to or arising under or out of or in
connection with each Support Obligation and (ii) substitute arrangements, if
required by a beneficiary of any Support Obligation, of Buyer or its
Affiliates (other than Sellers and any Company Group Member) shall be in
effect; or (b) without limiting the foregoing, in the event that the
requirements set forth in subsection (a) of this Section 6.08 are not met as
of the Closing, and subject to acceptance by Sellers in their reasonable
discretion, Buyer or its Affiliates shall, in lieu of providing substitute
arrangements in respect of Support Obligations pursuant to subsection (a)(ii)
of this Section 6.08, enter into such reasonable indemnification and
reimbursement agreements with Sellers or any of their Affiliates as reasonably
necessary to provide Sellers and such Affiliates with an effective release or
full indemnification with respect to all obligations and Liabilities of
Sellers and such Affiliates to be released pursuant to subsection (a) of this
Section 6.08 and, after Closing, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
effect substitute arrangements to replace such Support Obligations; provided
that upon any such 

replacement Buyer or its Affiliates, as applicable, shall be automatically
released from all of its obligations and Liabilities in respect of the
underlying indemnification and reimbursement arrangement with respect to
events that occur or arise after the date of such replacement.

Section 6.09 Restrictive Covenants - Principals. Each of the Principals and
each of their respective Affiliates (excluding ArcLight and its Affiliates for
purposes of this Section 6.09) (each, a "Restricted Party") agrees that during
the Restricted Period, except in his capacity as an officer, employee or other
agent of the Company Group or any of its Affiliates, each Restricted Party
shall not (i) hire or solicit any Person who is, at that time, or was at any

or hiring such Person as an employee or independent contractor, except
pursuant to a general solicitation (including through the use of recruiting
agencies) which is not directed specifically to employees of the Company
Group.

Section 6.11 Public Announcements. The Parties shall consult with each other
prior to issuing any publication or press release of any nature with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not make
or issue, or cause to be made or issued, any such publication or press release
prior to such consultation and without the prior written consent of the other
Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) except to
the extent, but only to such extent, that, in the opinion of the Party issuing
such publication or press release, such announcement or statement may be
required by Law, any listing agreement with any securities exchange or any
securities exchange regulation, in which case the Party proposing to issue
such publication or press release shall use its reasonable best efforts to
consult in good faith with the other Party before issuing any such publication
or press release and shall reasonably cooperate with the other Party in good
faith with respect to the timing, manner, and content of disclosure. 



Section 6.12 Confidentiality.

(a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect, pursuant to the terms thereof, and, in
addition, covenants and agrees to keep confidential, in accordance with the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Law, this
Agreement, its terms and provisions, and any information provided to Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated
prior to or at the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions
of this Section 6.12(a) shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect
pursuant to the terms hereof and thereof (and if such Confidentiality
Agreement was executed by an Affiliate of Buyer, then Buyer hereby agrees to
be bound by and to comply with the terms and conditions of such
Confidentiality Agreement and Buyer shall be a beneficiary of the rights under
such Confidentiality Agreement that are for the benefit of such Affiliate, and
Sellers shall be beneficiaries of the rights under such Confidentiality
Agreement that are for the benefit of any Company Group Member).

(b) From and after the Closing for a period of two (2) years thereafter,
Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, hold, and shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to hold, in confidence any and all information concerning the
Company Group, whether written or oral, except to the extent that such
information (i) is generally available to the public (through no fault of
Sellers or their respective Affiliates), or (ii) is lawfully acquired by
Sellers, any of their Affiliates or their respective Representatives from and
after the Closing from sources that are not known to Sellers to be prohibited
from disclosing such information by a legal or contractual obligation. If any
Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives is
compelled to disclose any such confidential information by judicial or
administrative process or by other requirements of Law, then such Seller shall
promptly notify Buyer in writing, to the extent practicable and legally
permitted, and shall disclose only that portion of such information which, in
the advice of legal counsel, such Seller is legally required to disclose;
provided, however, that such Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with Buyer to obtain an appropriate protective order upon Buyer's
request and at Buyer's sole expense or other reasonable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded such information.

Section 6.13 Insurance; DandO Coverage. At the Closing, Buyer will, or will
cause the Company to, purchase and, following the Closing, maintain a "tail"
policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance covering acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing with respect to those
individuals who are currently covered by the Company Group's directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy on the same terms and scope with respect
to such coverage, and amount, for such individuals for six (6) years after the
Closing ("Tail Insurance"). For a period of six (6) years following Closing,
Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Company Group not to, make any alteration
or amendment to any directors' or officers' liability insurance or to the
rights of any directors or officers or other Persons to exculpation,
indemnification, and advancement of expenses afforded to such rights under any
Company Group Member's Organizational Documents that, in either case, would
negatively affect such insurance or such rights as in effect immediately prior
to Closing. Such rights to exculpation, indemnification, and advancement of
expenses shall be the primary source of indemnification of such Persons and
any other indemnification or similar rights shall be secondary. The Persons
entitled to the Tail Insurance and rights to exculpation, indemnification, and
advancement of expenses set forth in this Section 6.13 are intended to be
third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.13. This Section 6.13 shall
survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer. Buyer shall, and
shall cause the Company Group to, require any successor to the Company Group
or any Company Group Member (whether by merger, purchase, or otherwise) to be
bound by the provisions of this Section 6.13. 

Section 6.14 Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at any time and from time to time after the Closing, at any Party's
request and without further consideration, the other Parties shall (and in the
case of Buyer, shall and shall cause the Company Group, as applicable, to)
execute and deliver to such Party such other instruments of sale, transfer,
conveyance, assignment, and confirmation, including all Permits issued under
Environmental Law, provide such materials and information and take such other
actions as such Party may reasonably request in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents.

Section 6.15 Intercompany Agreements. Except as otherwise set forth in Section
6.15 of the Disclosure Schedule or in connection with any transactions to be
entered into in connection with the Wind-Down, (a) Sellers and their
Affiliates (other than the Company Group Members), on the one hand, and the
Company Group Members, on the other hand, shall have paid, settled, cancelled,
waived, forgiven, or released any Liabilities under all intercompany accounts,
balances, payables, receivables, or indebtedness between such parties
("Intercompany Accounts"), such that the Company Group Members, on the one
hand, and Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Company Group), on the
other hand, do not have any further Liability to one another in respect of
such Intercompany Accounts following Closing and (b) the Affiliate Contracts
listed in Section 6.15 of the Disclosure Schedule shall be terminated and be
of no further force or effect from and after the Closing.

Section 6.16 Waiver, Release and Discharge.

(a) Effective as of the Closing, each Seller does hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably release, on behalf of itself, and its successors, assigns,
administrators and executors, waive and forever discharge the Company Group
(the "Released Parties"), from any and all liabilities, duties, and
obligations to such Seller, of any kind or nature whatsoever, to the extent
arising from any act, omission, event, or transaction occurring (or any
circumstances existing) on or prior to the date hereof (with the exception of
any obligations of the Released Parties pursuant to, otherwise contemplated
by, or arising under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents,
including relating to the Wind-Down). Each Seller understands that this is a
full and final general release of all liabilities, duties, and obligations of
any nature whatsoever, whether or not known, suspected or claimed, that could
have been asserted in any legal or equitable proceeding against the Released
Parties, other than those reserved pursuant to the preceding sentence. 



(b) Effective as of the Closing, each of Buyer and each Company Group Member,
on behalf of itself and its successors, assigns, administrators and executors,
waives and forever discharges any individual who served as a director or
officer of any Company Group Member at any time prior to the Closing (each, a
"DandO Released Party") from and against any and all liabilities, duties and
obligations to Buyer or any Company Group Member of any kind or nature
whatsoever, to the extent arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Closing and arising out of or pertaining to any
DandO Released Party's capacity as a director or officer of any Company Group
Member, or status as such, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Closing Date to the fullest extent permitted by Law.

Section 6.17 Exclusivity. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement, none of Sellers,
the Company Group, or any of their respective Affiliates shall, directly or
indirectly, and shall cause each of their respective Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly: (a) make, discuss or inquire regarding any Competing
Proposal or join with, or invite, any Person or group of Persons to be
involved in the making of, discussion or inquiry concerning any Competing
Proposal; (b) provide any information regarding the Company Group or afford
access to the assets, business, properties, or Books and Records of the
Company Group, to any Person or groups of Persons, in each case, for purpose
of assisting with, facilitating or encouraging a Competing Proposal; (c)
solicit, knowingly encourage, knowingly facilitate, knowingly induce, or enter
into any negotiation or discussion with any Person or group of Persons
regarding a Competing Proposal; (d) enter into any letter of intent, agreement
in principle, acquisition agreement, or any other Contract or arrangement,
whether written or oral, relating to any Competing Proposal; (e) provide,
arrange, offer to provide, or otherwise knowingly assist in the provision of
equity or debt financing in respect of any Competing Transaction or Competing
Proposal; or (f) consummate any Competing Transaction; provided, however, that
Buyer hereby acknowledges that prior to the date of the Exclusivity Agreement,
the Company provided information relating to the Company Group and afforded
access to, and engaged in discussions with, other Persons in connection with a
proposed Competing Transaction and that such information, access and
discussions could reasonably enable another Person to form a basis for a
Competing Transaction without any breach by the Company of this Section 6.17.
Each of Sellers, the Company Group, and their respective Affiliates shall, and
shall cause each of their respective Representatives, to immediately cease and
suspend any existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to any Competing Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company may respond to any unsolicited proposal regarding a
Competing Transaction by indicating that the Company is subject to an
exclusivity agreement and is unable to provide any information related to the
Company Group or entertain any proposals or offers or engage in any
negotiations or discussions concerning a Competing Transaction for as long as
that exclusivity agreement remains in effect; provided, however, that as soon
as reasonably practicable, the Company must promptly provide Buyer with
written notice and a copy of such unsolicited proposal and a copy of the
Company's response.

Section 6.18 Casualty Loss.

(a) If, prior to the Closing, all or any portion of the assets or properties
of the Company Group, are damaged or destroyed by fire, hurricane, or other
casualty, are taken in condemnation or under the right of eminent domain, or
are about to be taken in proceedings for such purposes that are pending or
threatened, 

in each such case, the repair or replacement cost of which would be equal to
or exceed one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000), Buyer shall have the
option to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 10.01(b).

(b) Subject to subsection (a) above, if, prior to the Closing, all or any
portion of the assets or properties of the Company Group, are damaged or
destroyed by fire, hurricane, or other casualty, are taken in condemnation or
under the right of eminent domain, or are about to be taken in proceedings for
such purposes which are pending or threatened, in each such case, the repair
or replacement cost of which would be equal to or exceed fifty million dollars
($50,000,000), but less than one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000), Buyer
and Sellers shall enter into good faith negotiations either (i) to adjust the
Purchase Price to take into consideration such destruction, taking, or pending
or threatened taking of such assets and properties of the Company Group, or
(ii) to repair the assets or properties that have been damaged or destroyed,
the cost of which will be fully paid by Sellers. If Buyer and Sellers are
unable to agree on an adjusted Purchase Price or repair plan within ten (10)
days of such destruction, taking or pending or threatened taking of such
assets or properties, then Sellers may, within ten (10) days after such ten
(10) day period, elect to repair the assets or properties prior to Closing, or
within a defined time period as reasonably mutually acceptable to the Parties,
to their condition prior to any such damage or destruction regardless of cost,
in accordance with the Company Group's customary practices, or in the event
Sellers do not agree to such repair, Buyer may terminate this Agreement upon
written notice to Sellers in accordance with Section 10.01(b). In the event
the Sellers elect to repair such assets or properties, the Closing Date shall
be postponed for the amount of time reasonably necessary to complete such
repair as reasonably mutually acceptable to the Parties and the Sellers shall
be entitled to the proceeds of any insurance received in connection with such
damage or destruction (and, if paid to Buyer or the Company Group, such
proceeds shall be promptly remitted to the Sellers); provided, however, that
in no event shall the Closing Date be extended beyond the Outside Date
pursuant to this Section 6.18(b) unless otherwise agreed to in writing by
Buyer.

(c) Sellers shall not voluntarily compromise, settle, or adjust any amounts
payable exceeding one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) by reason of any
destruction, taking, or pending or threatened taking as to the assets or
properties of the Company Group without first obtaining the written consent of
Buyer.

Section 6.19 Post-Closing Access to Information.

(a) After the Closing Date, Buyer and its Affiliates shall, and shall cause
the Company Group to, grant to Sellers and their Representatives, reasonable
access, upon reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, to the
Books and Records of the Company Group (and the reasonable assistance of
employees responsible for maintaining such Books and Records), and shall
afford Sellers or their Representatives the right, at Sellers' expense, to
take extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, for such purposes as
determined by Sellers to be reasonably necessary, including investigating,
settling, preparing for, prosecuting, or defending any Action, preparing
reports to equityholders and Governmental Authorities, preparing and
delivering accounting or other statements provided for under this Agreement or
otherwise, preparing Tax Returns, pursuing Tax refunds, or responding to or
disputing any Tax audit or the determination of any matter relating to the
rights and obligations of Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates under
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document. Buyer shall maintain, and
shall cause the Company Group to maintain, such Books and Records until the
later of the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date and any applicable
statutory or regulatory retention period, as the same may be extended, or if
any of the Books and Records pertain to any claim or dispute pending on the
seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall maintain any of the
Books and Records designated by Sellers or their Representatives until such
claim or dispute is finally resolved and the time for all appeals has been
exhausted. 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Closing, neither Buyer nor the
Company Group shall be obligated to provide Sellers with access to any Books
and Records (including personnel files) pursuant to this Section 6.19 where
such access would violate any Law.

Section 6.20 Sellers' Financing Cooperation.

(a) During the Interim Period, Sellers will cause each of the Company Group
Members to use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Buyer, at Buyer's
sole cost and expense, in connection with any debt or equity financing,
including the offering or private placement of debt or equity securities (a
"Financing"), pursued by Buyer or its Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein, solely to the extent contemplated by the
following clauses (i)‑(iv): (i) the reasonable cooperation with Buyer's
marketing efforts related to a Financing; (ii) (A) the reasonable
participation by senior management of the Company Group in rating agency
presentations and meetings with rating agencies and (B) a reasonable number of
roadshows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and meetings with
prospective lenders and investors; (iii) delivery to Buyer and its Financing
Sources (A) on the Signing Date, the information contemplated by subparts (a)
and (b) of the definition of Financing Information, (B) on or prior to August
31, 2015, the information contemplated by subpart (c) of the definition of
Financing Information and (C) within ten (10) Business Days after the date
requested by Buyer, the Financing Deliverables; and (iv) authorizing the
independent auditors of the Company Group to cooperate with a Financing,
including by providing customary "comfort letters" (including customary
"negative assurances") and customary consents to the inclusion of audit
reports in any relevant marketing materials. Sellers hereby consent to the use
of all of the Company Group's logos in connection with a Financing; provided,
that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage Sellers or the Company Group or the
reputation or goodwill of Sellers or any Company Group Member. Notwithstanding
any other provision set forth herein or in any other agreement between Sellers
and Buyer (or its Affiliates), Sellers agree that Buyer and its Affiliates may
share customary and reasonable projections with respect to the Company Group
to the extent such projections have been prepared by the Company Group and
shared with Buyer as of the date hereof with its Financing Sources and that
Buyer, its Affiliates and such Financing Sources may share such information
with other potential Financing Sources in connection with any marketing
efforts in connection with a Financing. Sellers will use reasonable best
efforts to reasonably promptly update Buyer with respect to any material
developments relating to the Company Group (excluding the Wind-Down) during
the Interim Period. For the avoidance of doubt, the efforts of the Sellers and
the Company Group pursuant to this Section 6.20 shall not be deemed to require
the Sellers or the Company Group to prepare any additional financial
information other than the Financing Information. 



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of
Sellers or any of the Company Group Members shall be required by this Section
6.20 to (i) take any action or provide any assistance that unreasonably
interferes with the ongoing operations of Sellers or the Company Group, (ii)
pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of any
documents related to a Financing, (iii) execute or deliver any certificate,
document, instrument or agreement that is effective prior to the Closing, or
agree to any change or modification of any existing certificate, document,
instrument or agreement that is effective prior thereto (other than a payoff
letter with respect to any Closing Indebtedness), (iv) incur any Liability in
connection with the Financing prior to the Closing, (v) cooperate to the
extent that such cooperation would (A) cause any condition to Closing set
forth in Article VII to not be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this
Agreement or (B) require any action that would reasonably be expected to
conflict with or violate the Company's Organizational Documents or any Law, or
result in the material contravention of, or result in a material violation or
breach of, or default under, any material Contract, or (vi) execute, prior to
the Signing Date, any definitive financing documents, including any credit or
other agreements, pledge or security documents, or other certificates, legal
opinions or documents in connection with the Financing (provided, that
notwithstanding the above to the contrary, the Company Group Members may be
required to reasonably assist Buyer in the preparation thereof). Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sellers, the Company Group Members and
their respective Affiliates, and their respective pre-Closing directors,
officers, employees and Representatives, from and against any Liability or
obligation to any Financing Source or other Person in connection with any
Financing, in each case other than to the extent any such Liability arises
from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Sellers or
the Company Group Members, as applicable. Except for the representations and
warranties of the Company Group set forth in Article III and the Sellers set
forth in Article IV, the Sellers, the Company Group and their respective
Affiliates shall not have any Liability to Buyer in respect of any financial
information or data or other information provided pursuant to this Section
6.20. Buyer shall promptly reimburse, to the extent paid, or pay, to the
extent unpaid, the Sellers and the Company Group for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs incurred by the Sellers and the Company Group and their
respective Affiliates after the date hereof in connection with this Section
6.20, including the cost of preparation (by accounting firms or otherwise) of
any Financing Information and the provision of any comfort letters.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the
condition set forth in Section 7.02, as it applies to the Company's
obligations under Section 6.20(a), shall be deemed satisfied unless the
Company has knowingly and willfully materially breached its obligations under
Section 6.20(a) and (ii) the covenants and obligations of the Sellers, the
Sellers' Representative in Section 6.20(a) shall not survive the Closing,
including for purposes of Article XI.

Section 6.21 Data Room. Within five (5) Business Days following the Closing
Date, Sellers shall deliver to Buyer two DVD copies of all of the documents
made available in the Data Room.

Section 6.22 Wind Down. NET Trading and Buyer agree to take the actions set
forth on Exhibit E.

TAX MATTERS

(i) Sellers shall, severally (and not jointly), indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless Buyer from and against all Losses incurred or suffered in respect of
(a) any Taxes for which Sellers are responsible pursuant to Section 9.01(c),
(b) all Seller Taxes, and (c) all Taxes of any other Person imposed on any
Company Group Member as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise,
which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring prior to or on the
Closing Date; provided, however, that each Seller shall have no obligation to
indemnify Buyer with respect to any Taxes to the extent such Taxes were taken
into account in the calculation of Net Working Capital.

(ii) The Parties acknowledge and agree that, in accordance with Section
9.01(l), for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Parties will treat the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, with respect to the Buyer, as a
purchase of the assets of the Company, and, with respect to the Sellers, as a
sale of their member interests in the Company. Sellers shall be responsible
for the preparation and timely filing of all Tax Returns required to be filed
by or with respect to the Company Group with respect to any Tax period that
ends prior to or on the Closing Date (including, in accordance with the
preceding sentence, the final Form 1065 U.S. Return of Partnership Income for
the Company for the taxable year ending on the Closing Date and for any prior
taxable years). Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation and timely
filing of any Tax Return that is not required to be prepared by Sellers
pursuant to the preceding sentence and that relates to a Straddle Period, and
shall pay all Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns; provided, that not
later than five (5) Business Days prior to the due date for the payment of
Taxes with respect to such Tax Return, each Seller shall pay to Buyer the
amount of Seller Taxes owed by such Seller with respect to such Tax Return;
provided, further, that no Seller shall be obligated to make a payment
pursuant to this Section 9.01(a)(ii) to the extent such Seller Taxes were
taken into account in the calculation of Net Working Capital. All such Tax
Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice except to
the extent otherwise provided in this Agreement or otherwise required by
applicable Law. Not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date
(including any extensions) for each Tax Return described herein (other than
the final Form 1065 U.S. Return of Partnership Income for the Company for the
taxable year ending on the Closing Date and for any prior taxable years), the
party responsible for preparing such Tax Return shall deliver a copy of such
Tax Return to the other party for its review and reasonable comment. The party
responsible for preparing such Tax Return shall consider in good faith any
such comments received from the other party not less than eight (8) days prior
to the due date (including any extensions) for filing such Tax Return and
shall deliver a final copy of such Tax Return to such other party not less
than three (3) days prior to such due date. 



(iii) The Parties acknowledge and agree that any payments made pursuant to
Section 3.29 shall be in respect of services performed prior to the Closing
Date, and Sellers may further document such obligations prior to the Closing.
Accordingly, the Parties agree that such payments are properly reportable on
the final Form 1065 U.S. Return of Partnership Income for the Company for the
taxable year ending on the Closing Date.

(b) In the case of Taxes that are payable by any Company Group Member with
respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that is
attributable to the portion of the period ending on the close of business on
the Closing Date shall be:

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income
or receipts or (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the applicable taxable period
ended with (and included) the close of business on the Closing Date; provided,
that exemptions, allowances, or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated
between the period ending on and including the close of business on the
Closing Date and the period beginning after the close of business on the
Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each period; and

(ii) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets of any Company Group Member, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes
for the entire Straddle Period, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the close of business on the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period;

provided, however, that Taxes shall be treated as due for the period during
which the base of such Taxes are determined without regard to whether the
payment of such Taxes provides the right to business or other benefits for
another period.

(c) All sales Tax, use Tax, stamp Tax, transfer Tax, conveyance, registration
or other similar Tax, if any, imposed on the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Sellers and fifty percent
(50%) by Buyer. Each of the Parties hereto shall prepare and file, and shall
fully cooperate with the other party with respect to the preparation and
filing of, any Tax Returns and other filings relating to any such Taxes or
charges as may be required.

(d) After Closing, Sellers and Buyer shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to):

(i) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party
is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with Section 9.01(a),
and in connection therewith, provide the other party with any necessary powers
of attorney; 



(ii) cooperate fully in preparing for and defending any audits of, or disputes
with Taxing Authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the Company Group
Members;

(iii) make available to the other and to any Taxing Authority as reasonably
requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of the
Company Group Members; and

(iv) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any
Taxing Authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with
respect to a Company Group Member.

(e) After the Closing, no amended Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing
Period or Straddle Period shall be filed by or on behalf of any Company Group
Member without the prior written consent of Sellers.

(f) Within one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall prepare or cause to be prepared an allocation schedule (the "Allocation
Schedule"), allocating the Purchase Price (plus any other amounts that are
required to be taken into account as consideration for the purchase and sale
contemplated under this Agreement for federal income Tax purposes) among the
Company Group's assets in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code
and Treasury Regulations thereunder. Buyer shall deliver the Allocation
Schedule to Sellers as soon as practicable after the Closing Date for Sellers'
review and reasonable comments. Within thirty (30) days after receiving such
Allocation Schedule, Sellers shall notify Buyer in writing if Sellers have any
objections to the allocations on the Allocation Schedule and shall specify the
basis for any such objections. If Sellers do not notify Buyer of any objection
to the Allocation Schedule, then it shall be deemed agreed to by Sellers and
Buyer and the Allocation Schedule shall be final and binding. If Sellers
object to any allocations on the Allocation Schedule, then Sellers and Buyer
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disagreement regarding the
Allocation Schedule as soon as practicable (taking into account the due date
of any Tax Returns on which the allocation set forth in the Allocation
Schedule is required to be reflected) and shall memorialize the agreed
allocation in a final Allocation Schedule, which shall be final and binding.
The final Allocation Schedule shall be revised to take into account subsequent
adjustments to the Purchase Price, including any adjustments made pursuant to
Section 2.07, Section 2.08 or Section 2.09 (which shall be treated for Tax
purposes, to the extent possible under applicable Law, as adjustments to the
Purchase Price), in accordance with the provisions of Section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

(g) Buyer and Sellers shall report and file Tax Returns for Tax purposes in
all respects consistent with the Allocation Schedule. None of Buyer, Sellers,
the Company Group or their respective Affiliates shall take any position for
Tax purposes (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule unless required to do so by
applicable Law. If any Taxing Authority disputes the allocation set forth in
the Allocation Schedule, the party receiving notice of the dispute shall
promptly notify the other Party of such dispute and the parties shall
cooperate in good faith in responding to such dispute in order to preserve the
effectiveness of the allocation set forth in the Allocation Schedule. 



(h) With respect to the Code Section 754 election in place for NET Mexico,
Buyer and Sellers agree that, for purposes of computing special basis
adjustments under Section 743 of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section
1.743‑1, for purposes of allocating such special basis adjustments among the
assets of the NET Mexico under Section 755 of the Code and Treasury Regulation
Section 1.755‑1, for purposes of applying Section 751 of the Code and Treasury
Regulation Section 1.751‑1, and for all other purposes, the respective fair
market values of the assets of NET Mexico will be determined in accordance
with the methods and procedures described in Section 9.01(f). Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to Sellers a determination of the respective fair market
values of the assets of NET Mexico in a manner consistent with the preceding
sentence. To the extent a Code Section 754 election is not currently in place
for NET Mexico, Sellers agree to cooperate with Buyer to cause NET Mexico to
make such election as required under Section 8.2(c) of the NET Mexico LLC
Agreement on the partnership return for NET Mexico for the taxable year during
which the Closing Date occurs.

(i) The amount of any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Company for any
taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and for the portion of
any Straddle Period through the end of the date of the Closing Date shall be
for the account of the Sellers except to the extent such refund or credit of
Taxes was taken into account in the calculation of Net Working Capital. The
amount of any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Company for any taxable
period or the portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the date of the
Closing Date shall be for the account of the Buyer. The amount of any refunds
or credits of Taxes of the Company for any Straddle Period shall be equitably
apportioned between the Buyer and the Sellers in accordance with the
principles set forth in Section 9.01(b). Each Party shall forward, and shall
cause its Affiliates to forward, to the Party entitled to receive a refund or
credit of Tax pursuant to this Section 9.01(i) the amount of such refund or
credit within thirty (30) days after such refund is received, or such credit
is recognized, in each case net of any costs or expenses incurred by such
Party or its Affiliates in procuring such refund or credit. Buyer shall take
all necessary actions, or cause the Company to take all necessary actions, as
commercially reasonable (i) to obtain any refunds of Taxes of the Company for
the account of the Sellers pursuant to this Section 9.01(i), or (ii) to obtain
credits or offsets to Taxes of the Company attributable to taxable periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date or the portion of any Straddle Period
through the end of the date of the Closing Date.

(j) The following shall apply to any Tax Claim for which Sellers could have
liability pursuant to this Agreement (an "Indemnified Tax Claim"): Buyer shall
inform Sellers of the commencement of any audit, examination or proceeding
relating in whole or in part to Taxes for which Sellers is responsible to
indemnify Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. With respect to any Indemnified
Tax Claim relating to a Tax period that ends prior to the Closing Date,
Sellers shall have the right, at their sole costs and expense, to control all
proceedings and may make all decisions taken in connection with such Tax Claim
(including selection of counsel). With respect to any Indemnified Tax Claim
relating to a Straddle Period, Buyer shall control, at its own cost and
expense, all proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim; provided,
however, that the Buyer shall give written notice thereof to Sellers, and
Sellers shall be entitled, at their sole cost and expense, to participate in
the proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim. Sellers shall
promptly, but not later than ten (10) Business Days after receipt of notice of
the commencement of any audit, examination or proceeding, notify Buyer if
Sellers decide not to control the defense or settlement of any Indemnified Tax
Claim which they are entitled to control, or if Sellers decide not to
participate in proceedings in which they are entitled to participate, and the
Buyer shall thereupon be permitted to defend and settle such proceeding
without prejudice. Buyer will (and will cause the Company Group Members to)
inform Sellers promptly, and send Sellers copies promptly upon receipt, of any
notice of an audit, examination, claim or assessment for any Tax for which
Sellers are responsible and keep Sellers informed of progress in the 

proceedings and allow Sellers to attend any meetings and scheduled calls with
the Governmental Authorities to the extent Sellers are not controlling the
proceedings. Buyer shall not settle, consent to the entry of a judgment of or
compromise any audit, examination or proceeding relating to Taxes for which it
is entitled to indemnification hereunder without the prior written consent of
Sellers.

(k) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Parties agree to report
each indemnification payment made in respect of a Loss and each payment made
pursuant to Section 2.07, Section 2.08 or Section 2.09 as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for federal income Tax purposes.

(l) The Parties recognize that Buyer's purchase of the Company Interests will
be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as (i) a sale by Sellers of
the Company Interests, and (ii) a purchase by Buyer of the assets of the
Company, subject to the liabilities of the Company, pursuant to Revenue Ruling
99‑6, 1999‑1 C.B. 432\. None of Sellers or Buyer shall take any position for
income Tax purposes that is inconsistent with such treatment.

(m) If a "Make-Whole Amount" is required to be paid to the members of NET
Mexico pursuant to Section 9.4(d)(iii) of the NET Mexico LLC Agreement as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer shall make
such payment and shall indemnify Sellers and hold Sellers harmless from any
Loss related to such payment.



ARTICLE X.

TERMINATION

Section 10.01 Right of Termination. Prior to Closing, this Agreement may be
terminated at any time:

(a) by mutual written consent of Sellers and Buyer;

(b) by Buyer upon notice to Sellers in accordance with the provisions provided
in Section 6.18(a) and Section 6.18(b);

(c) by the Sellers' Representative or Buyer, if any court or other
Governmental Authority shall have issued, enacted, entered, promulgated, or
enforced any Law or issued any Order (in either case, that is final and non-
appealable and that has not been vacated, withdrawn, or overturned)
restraining, enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the material
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.01(c) shall not be available to
a Party if the issuance or promulgation of such Law or Order was primarily due
to the failure of such Party to perform or comply with any of the covenants,
agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by it prior
to the Closing; 



(d) by the Sellers' Representative, if:

(i) Sellers are not then in material breach of any provision of this Agreement
and there has been a material breach, inaccuracy in, or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement made by Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of satisfaction of any of
the conditions in Section 8.01 or Section 8.02 on or prior to the Outside Date
(other than through failure of Sellers to comply with their obligations under
this Agreement), and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after
receipt of notice thereof from the Sellers' Representative (or any shorter
period of time that remains between the date the Sellers' Representative
provides written notice of such violation or breach and the Outside Date); or

(ii) the Closing has not occurred on or prior to the Outside Date, unless such
failure shall be due to the failure of Sellers to perform or comply, in all
material respects, with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions hereof
to be performed or complied with by it prior to the Closing; or

(e) by Buyer, if:

(i) Buyer is not then in material breach of any provision of this Agreement
and there has been a material breach, inaccuracy in, or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement made by Sellers pursuant to
this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of satisfaction of any of
the conditions in Section 7.01 or Section 7.02 on or prior to the Outside Date
(other than through failure of Buyer to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement), and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after receipt
of notice thereof from the Buyer (or any shorter period of time that remains
between the date Buyer provides written notice of such violation or breach and
the Outside Date); or

(ii) the Closing has not occurred on or prior to the Outside Date, unless such
failure shall be due to the failure of Buyer to perform or comply, in all
material respects, with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions hereof
to be performed or complied with by it prior to the Closing.

Section 10.02 Effect of Termination. If any Party terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.01, all obligations and Liabilities of the Parties
under this Agreement shall terminate and become void; provided, however, that
(a) nothing herein shall relieve any Party from Liability for any material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement in this
Agreement prior to the date of termination and (b) the terms of Section
6.03(e), Section 6.12, this Section 10.02, and Article XII (other than Section
12.12), and the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and survive any termination of this Agreement; provided, that if this
Agreement is terminated (other than a termination by Buyer pursuant to Section
10.01(e)), Buyer shall remain obligated to reimburse the Sellers, the Sellers'
Representative or the Company Group pursuant to Section 6.20(b) and Exhibit E. 





ARTICLE XI.

and limitations in this Article XI, from and after the Closing, each Seller
will, severally, and not jointly, up to their respective Pro Rata Share of the
related Losses, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer, the Company Group,
the respective Affiliates of the foregoing, and the partners, members,
managers, directors, officers, shareholders, employees, successors, and
assigns of the foregoing (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees") from and
against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by any of the Buyer
Indemnitees arising out of or resulting from: (a) a breach of any of the
representations or warranties contained in Article III or Article IV; (b) the
failure of any Seller or any Company Group Member to perform any of the
covenants or obligations under this Agreement to the extent required to be
performed by such Seller or such Company Group Member on or prior to the
Closing (other than in connection with Section 6.20(a)); and (c) the matters
set forth in Section 11.01(c) of the Disclosure Schedule.

Section 11.02 Indemnification by Each Seller. Subject to the other terms and
limitations in this Article XI, from and after the Closing, each Seller will
individually indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees from
and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by any of the Buyer
Indemnitees arising out of or resulting from the failure of such Seller to
perform any of the covenants or obligations under this Agreement to the extent
required to be performed by such Seller after the Closing.

Section 11.03 Indemnification by Buyer. Subject to the other terms and
limitations of this Article XI, from and after the Closing, Buyer will
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Sellers, their respective Affiliates, and
the partners, members, managers, directors, officers, shareholders, employees,
successors, and assigns of the foregoing (collectively, the "Seller
Indemnitees") from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by any
of the Seller Indemnitees arising out of or resulting from: (a) a breach of
any of Buyer's representations or warranties contained in this Agreement; (b)
the failure of Buyer to perform any of the covenants or obligations under this
Agreement to the extent to be performed by Buyer prior to or on the Closing;
(c) the failure of Buyer or any Company Group Member to perform any of the
covenants or obligations under this Agreement to the extent required to be
performed by Buyer or any Company Group Member after the Closing; and (d) the
Assigned NET Trading Contracts and the Transferred Assets and any Liabilities
relating thereto that arise from and after the Closing.

Section 11.04 Claim Procedures.

(a) Each Person entitled to be indemnified under this Article XI (each, an
"Indemnitee") agrees that after it becomes aware of facts that would
reasonably be likely to give rise to a claim by it for indemnification
pursuant to this Article XI, such Indemnitee must assert its claim for
indemnification under this Article XI (each, a "Claim") prior to the
applicable Cutoff Date by providing a written notice (a "Claim Notice") to the
Person allegedly required to provide indemnification protection under this
Article XI (each, an "Indemnitor") specifying, in reasonable detail, the
nature and basis for such Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an
Indemnitee's failure to send or delay in sending a Claim Notice will not
relieve the Indemnitor from Liability hereunder with respect to such Claim,
except in the event and only to the extent that the Indemnitor is materially
prejudiced by such failure or delay. 



(b) The Buyer Indemnitees will be entitled to bring a Claim, without
duplication of any Losses, under any clause of Section 11.01 or Section 11.02
as applicable, and the Seller Indemnitees will be entitled to bring a Claim,
without duplication of any Losses, under any clause of Section 11.03, in each
case, even if such Claim could be brought under more than one of such clauses.

(c) At the reasonable request of the Indemnitor, the Indemnitee shall grant
the Indemnitor and its Representatives all reasonable access to the books,
records, employees (including for conferences, discovery and proceedings as
may be reasonably requested) and properties of the Indemnitee, its Affiliates
and the Company Group to the extent reasonably related to the Claim set forth
in a Claim Notice

Section 11.05 Third Party Claims.

(a) In the event of the assertion of any third party Claim by an Indemnitee,
the Indemnitor will have the right, at such Indemnitor's expense, to assume
the defense of same including the appointment and selection of counsel on
behalf of the Indemnitee so long as such counsel is reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnitee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitor will continue to
be entitled to assert any limitation on any Claims contained in this Article
XI. Subject to Section 11.05(c), the Indemnitor will have the right to settle
or compromise or take any corrective or remediation action with respect to any
such Claim by all appropriate proceedings, and the Indemnitor shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to diligently prosecute such proceedings to a
final conclusion or settle such proceedings at the discretion of the
Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor assumes the defense of any such third party
Claim, the Indemnitee will be entitled, at its own cost and expense, to
participate with the Indemnitor in the defense of any such Claim; provided,
that, for the avoidance of doubt, such Claim and the prosecution and
negotiation thereof shall be controlled by the Indemnitor. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnitee will have the right to defend any such Claim until
such time as the Indemnitor agrees to assume the defense of such Claim, and
any costs or expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection therewith will
be Losses hereunder and indemnifiable to the extent it is finally determined
that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XI
with respect to such Claim.

(b) If the Indemnitor fails to use commercially reasonable efforts to
diligently prosecute such Claim, the Indemnitee may assume control of such
defense and in the event it is finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction that the Claim was a matter for which the Indemnitor is
responsible under the terms of this Agreement, the Indemnitor will bear the
reasonable costs and expenses of such defense (including fees and expenses of
counsel). If the Indemnitee assumes the control of such defense, then the
Indemnitor shall be entitled, at its sole option and expense, to participate
in any prosecution of such Claim or any settlement negotiations with respect
to such Claim.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Indemnitor
will not be permitted to settle, compromise, take any corrective or remedial
action, or enter into an agreed judgment or 

consent decree, in each case, that subjects the Indemnitee to any criminal
liability, requires an admission of guilt or wrongdoing on the part of the
Indemnitee or imposes any continuing obligation on, or requires any payment
from the Indemnitee without the Indemnitee's prior written consent, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, whether or not the Indemnitor will have
assumed the defense of a third-party Claim, the Indemnitee will not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any third-party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor.

Section 11.06 Limitations and Other Indemnity Claim Matters. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Article XI or elsewhere in this Agreement,
the following terms shall apply to any Claim for indemnification arising out
of this Agreement or related to the transactions contemplated hereby:

(a) No claim for indemnification under Section 11.01 and 11.03(a) and (b) may
be asserted by any Indemnitee following the Indemnity Holdback Release Date
(such survival period, the "Cutoff Date"); provided, however, that this
survival period shall not affect or limit any Claim (A) pending as of the
Cutoff Date, (B) arising out of any breach of any Seller Fundamental
Representation, Buyer Fundamental Representation or fraud, which may be
asserted indefinitely, or (C) arising out of a Claim based on Section
11.01(c), which may be asserted indefinitely.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Buyer
Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 11.01 or
11.02, unless and until (i) the Losses to which the Buyer Indemnitees are
entitled to indemnification from the Sellers with respect to such particular
Claim or series of related Claims exceed $250,000 (the "Indemnity Threshold")
and (ii) the Buyer Indemnitees have suffered Losses arising from Claims under
Section 11.01 or 11.02 in excess of $15,000,000 in the aggregate (the
"Indemnity Deductible") (it being understood that any Claim (including any
related Claims) for amounts less than the Indemnity Threshold shall be ignored
in determining whether the Indemnity Deductible has been exceeded) and,
subject to the terms of this Article XI, once such Losses exceed the Indemnity
Deductible, the Buyer Indemnitees shall only be entitled to seek recovery for
all such Losses in excess of the Indemnity Deductible; provided, however, that
the Indemnity Threshold and the Indemnity Deductible shall not apply to (i)
any breach of a Seller Fundamental Representation, (ii) any fraud; or (iii)
any Losses arising under Section 11.01(c). Furthermore, no Seller shall have
any Liability in the aggregate under Section 11.01 or Section 11.02 in excess
of such Seller's Pro Rata Share of the Indemnity Holdback Amount and the Buyer
Indemnitees shall have no recourse against such Seller with respect to any
Losses in excess of such amount (the "Cap"); provided, however, that the Cap
shall not apply to (i) any breach of a Seller Fundamental Representation, (ii)
any fraud; or (iii) any Losses arising under Section 11.01(c). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall any Seller have
any Liability under this Article XI in excess of the amount of the Purchase
Price actually received by it. Except with respect to any Losses arising under
Section 11.01(c) that exceed $10,000,000, and except with respect to any
breach of a Seller Fundamental Representation or any fraud, any liability of
the Sellers shall first be satisfied out of any remaining funds in the
Indemnity Holdback Amount. 



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein: (i) any Losses
hereunder shall be reduced in amount by any insurance proceeds,
indemnification payments, contribution payments or reimbursements realized by
any Buyer Indemnitee in connection with such Losses or any of the
circumstances giving rise thereto, and Buyer and all other Buyer Indemnitees
shall use reasonable efforts to realize such proceeds, payments or
reimbursements, as the case may be; provided, that for the purposes of this
subsection (i) if an Indemnitee actually receives an amount under insurance
coverage or otherwise from any other Person with respect to Losses sustained
at any time subsequent to any indemnification payment pursuant to this Article
XI, then such Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitor for any
payment made to the Indemnitee by such Indemnitor up to such amount so
realized or received by the Indemnitee; (ii) the amount of any Losses subject
to recovery under this Article XI by any Buyer Indemnitee shall be calculated
net of any amounts specifically accrued or reserved for in the Financial
Statements, (iii) no Losses shall be recoverable hereunder that, once
discovered and known by Buyer, the Company (in each case after the Closing) or
the Buyer Indemnitees, could have been avoided through reasonable efforts to
mitigate such Losses which were not taken by Buyer, the Company (in each case
after the Closing) or the Buyer Indemnitees (provided, that with respect to a
Claim) to the extent and for the period of time that it is actually assumed by
the Sellers or the Sellers' Representative pursuant to Section 11.05, from and
after the date on which the Buyer Indemnitee provided the Claim Notice to the
Sellers' Representative, this subsection (iii) shall only obligate the Buyer,
the Company Group and the Buyer Indemnitees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate, and cause their Representatives to cooperate, with the
Sellers' Representative's defense thereof; and (v) no Losses shall be
recoverable hereunder to extent such matter was taken into account (on a
dollar-for-dollar basis) in determining any adjustment to the Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 2.07, Section 2.08, or Section 2.09. The calculation of
Losses shall not include Losses arising from a change in any applicable Law or
accounting principle following the Closing Date.

(d) In no event shall any Seller have any Liability for indemnification under
this Article XI for any Losses to the extent such Losses are caused or
initiated by any action or omission by any Buyer Indemnitee or any Company
Group Member at the request or direction of any Buyer Indemnitee, including to
the extent any Losses resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Buyer Indemnitee. For the avoidance of doubt, no Buyer
Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover the amount of any Losses more than
once. In the event a Buyer Indemnitee or a Seller Indemnitee, as the case may
be, recovers Losses in respect of a claim for indemnification, no other Buyer
Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as applicable, may recover the same Losses in
respect of a claim for indemnification under this Agreement. Without limiting
the generality of the prior sentence, if a set of facts, conditions or events
constitutes a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement that is subject to the indemnification obligations under Section
11.01, Section 11.02 or Section 11.03, only one recovery of Losses shall be
allowed, and in no event shall there be any indemnification or duplication of
payments or recovery under different provisions of this Agreement arising out
of the same facts, conditions or events.

Section 11.07 Indemnity Holdback Amount. From and after the Closing, subject
to Section 11.06(b), the sole source of recovery that shall be available to
any Buyer Indemnitees with respect to Losses as to which the Sellers'
indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 11.01 or Section 11.02 apply
shall be through recovery against the Indemnity Holdback Amount, and no Buyer
Indemnitee shall have any recourse 

against the Sellers, their respective Affiliates or any other Person with
respect to any indemnifiable Losses pursuant to Section 11.01 or Section 11.02
other than Buyer's right to retain all or a portion of the Indemnity Holdback
Amount in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the conditions and
limitations set forth in, this Article XI. With respect to any Agreed Claim
indemnifiable by Sellers pursuant to this Article XI, Buyer shall have the
right (exercisable upon written notice to the Sellers' Representative) to
retain from the Indemnity Holdback Amount an amount equal to such Agreed Claim
(and in the amount of the exercise of such right and retention by Buyer of the
amount of such Agreed Claim from the Indemnity Holdback Amount, such amount
shall be deemed to have been paid by Sellers to the applicable Buyer
Indemnitees in satisfaction of the Sellers' obligations to pay such Agreed
Claim).

Section 11.08 Payments. Subject to Section 11.07, an Indemnitor will pay an
indemnification payment due under this Article XI to the Indemnitee within
five (5) Business Days after it is established (by final non-appealable court
order or agreement of the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee (each, an "Agreed
Claim")) that the Indemnitee is entitled to such payment under this Article
XI. Any indemnification payment payable (or, with respect to a Buyer
Indemnitee, retained by Buyer) pursuant to this Article XI shall be treated as
an adjustment to the aggregate consideration paid by Buyer.

Section 11.09 Exclusive Remedy. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, from
and after the Closing, the remedies available under this Article XI, Article
IX and under Section 12.12 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the
Parties for any and all claims relating (directly or indirectly) to the
subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
regardless of the legal theory under which such liability or obligation may be
sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law
or in equity or otherwise, and the Buyer Indemnitees will have no other remedy
or recourse with respect to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that this
exclusivity shall not limit or apply to any rights or remedies available at
law or in equity arising from fraud.

Section 11.10 Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties and
covenants of the Indemnitor, and the Indemnitee's right to indemnification
with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnitee (including by any of its
Representatives) or by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee or any of its
Representatives knew or should have known that any such representation or
warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by reason of the Indemnitee's
waiver of any condition set forth in Article VII or Article VIII, as the case
may be.

Section 11.11 Waiver of Other Representations.

(a) BUYER SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN ARTICLE III AND ARTICLE IV (AS
MODIFIED BY THE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE), NONE OF SELLERS OR ANY COMPANY GROUP
MEMBER NOR ANY OTHER PERSON MAKES, OR HAS MADE, ANY OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY IN RESPECT OF THE COMPANY GROUP, ITS BUSINESS OR
ANY OF ITS ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR OPERATIONS, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY
FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS OR FORECASTS RELATING TO THE COMPANY GROUP, AND ANY SUCH
OTHER REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED. 



(b) BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS CONDUCTED TO ITS SATISFACTION ITS OWN
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OF THE CONDITION, OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS OF EACH
COMPANY GROUP MEMBER AND, IN MAKING ITS DETERMINATION TO PROCEED WITH THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS BUYER HAS RELIED ON THE
RESULTS OF ITS OWN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION.

(c) EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, SELLERS' INTERESTS IN THE
COMPANY GROUP AND ITS ASSETS ARE BEING TRANSFERRED THROUGH THE SALE OF THE
COMPANY INTERESTS "AS IS, WHERE IS, WITH ALL FAULTS," AND SELLERS EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, AS TO THE CONDITION, VALUE OR QUALITY OF THE COMPANY AND ITS ASSETS
OR THE PROSPECTS (FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE), RISKS AND OTHER INCIDENTS OF THE
COMPANY AND ITS ASSETS.

Section 11.12 Materiality Qualifiers. For purposes of determining the amount
of Losses resulting from a breach of any Party's representations and
warranties herein for which the other Party hereto or any other Indemnitee is
entitled to indemnification hereunder, but in no event for the purposes of
determining whether there has been any such breach, any materiality qualifiers
(including any Material Adverse Effect qualifiers) contained in such Party's
representations or warranties (other than in the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 3.07(b), 3.09, 3.10, 3.16 and 3.17(a)) shall
be disregarded.



ARTICLE XII.

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 12.01 Notices.

Section 12.02 Entire Agreement. Except for the Confidentiality Agreement, this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents supersede all prior discussions
and agreements between the Parties and their respective Affiliates with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents contain the sole and entire agreement between the
Parties and their respective Affiliates with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof.

Section 12.03 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, each Party shall pay all costs and expenses it has incurred or
will incur in anticipation of, relating to or in connection with the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.

Section 12.04 Disclosure. Sellers may, at their option, include in the
Disclosure Schedule items that are not material, and any such inclusion, or
any references to dollar amounts, shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgment
or representation that such items are material, to establish any standard of
materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of
this Agreement. The disclosure of any fact or item in any section of the
Disclosure Schedule shall, should the existence of such facto or item be
relevant to any other section of the Disclosure Schedule, be deemed to be
disclosed with respect to that other section so long as the relevance of such
disclosure to such other section is reasonably apparent from the nature of
such disclosure. 

Section 12.05 Waiver. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at
any time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such
waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly
executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. No
waiver by either Party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one
or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same
or any other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion.

Section 12.06 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented, or
modified only by a written instrument duly executed by Buyer and Sellers'
Representative; provided that (i) Section 6.09 may not be amended,
supplemented, or modified without the written consent of the Buyer, Sellers'
Representative and Principals and (ii) Section 6.10 may not be amended,
supplemented, or modified without the written consent of the Buyer, Sellers'
Representative and ArcLight; provided, further, that any amendments,
supplements or modifications related to the Financing Sources in their
capacity as such, in Section 6.20, 12.07, 12.11 and 12.16 and this Section
12.06, shall receive the written consent of such Financing Sources.

Section 12.07 No Third Party Beneficiary. Except as expressly provided in
Section 6.13(a) and Section 6.14 the terms and provisions of this Agreement
are intended solely for the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of the Parties
to confer third party beneficiary rights upon any other Person; provided, that
the Financing Sources in their capacity as such shall be express third party
beneficiaries of Section 6.20, 12.06, 12.11 and 12.16 and this Section 12.07.

Section 12.08 Assignment; Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. No Party may assign this Agreement or any of its rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder without the express prior written consent
of the other Parties, and any attempted assignment, without such consent,
shall be null and void ab initio; provided, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer shall be entitled to assign all of its rights, interests and
obligations hereunder (other than its payment obligations) to its Affiliates
without the prior written consent of the other Parties, which such assignment
shall not relieve Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder.

Section 12.09 Invalid Provisions. If any provision of this Agreement is held
to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and
if the rights or obligations of any Party under this Agreement will not be
materially and adversely affected thereby, such provision shall be fully
severable, this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal,
invalid, or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, the
remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision
or by its severance herefrom, and in lieu of such illegal, invalid, or
unenforceable provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of this
Agreement a legal, valid, and enforceable provision as similar in terms to
such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision as may be possible. 



Section 12.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall be
deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement
delivered by e-mail or other means of electronic transmission shall be deemed
to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy of this
Agreement.

Section 12.11 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; JURY TRIAL WAIVER.

(a) This Agreement and all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Financing), including
any claims arising out of the Financing, shall be governed by the Laws of the
State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law principles that
would result in the application of any Law other than the Law of the State of
New York.

(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF
(I) STATE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK LOCATED IN NEW YORK COUNTY AND (II)
THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK FOR THE PURPOSES OF ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY (AND AGREES NOT TO COMMENCE ANY ACTION RELATING HERETO
(INCLUDING ANY ACTION AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE IN ITS CAPACITY AS SUCH)
EXCEPT IN SUCH COURTS). EACH OF THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREES THAT SERVICE OF ANY
PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICE OR DOCUMENT HAND DELIVERED OR SENT BY U.S. REGISTERED
MAIL TO SUCH PARTY'S RESPECTIVE ADDRESS SET FORTH IN SECTION 12.01 SHALL BE
EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF PROCESS FOR ANY ACTION IN NEW YORK WITH RESPECT TO ANY
MATTERS TO WHICH IT HAS SUBMITTED TO JURISDICTION AS SET FORTH IN THE
IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING SENTENCE. EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY ACTION
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO
THE FINANCING, IN (I) STATE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK LOCATED IN NEW
YORK COUNTY OR (II) THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, AND HEREBY FURTHER IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES AND AGREES NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH ACTION
BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, EACH PARTY AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY
ACTION OR PROCEEDING SO BROUGHT SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED BY
SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT IN ANY JURISDICTION OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED AT
LAW OR IN EQUITY.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES
AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY 

WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO
THE FINANCING. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE
EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (II) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (III) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) SUCH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 12.11(C).

Section 12.12 Specific Performance. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, (a) each Party recognizes and acknowledges that a breach by
it of any covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement shall cause the
other Parties to sustain irreparable harm for which they would not have an
adequate remedy at law, and therefore in the event of any such breach the
aggrieved Party shall, without the posting of bond or other security (any
requirement for which the Parties hereby waive), be entitled to the remedy of
specific performance of such covenants and agreements, including injunctive
and other equitable relief, in addition to any other remedy to which it might
be entitled, (b) a Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of any covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement,
and (c) in the event that any Action is brought in equity to enforce such
covenants or agreements, no Party shall allege, and each Party hereby waives
the defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law.

Section 12.13 Sellers' Representative. Each Seller designates the Sellers'
Representative as their true and lawful representative, agent and attorney-in-
fact of such Seller with full power and authority, including power of
substitution, acting in the name of and on behalf of such Seller, for all
purposes under this Agreement, including receipt of disclosures, granting or
executing consents or waivers, receiving notices, defending, compromising or
settling disputes with respect to indemnification claims and the calculation
of the Purchase Price and any adjustments thereto and agreeing to and
executing amendments or modifications to this Agreement.

(a) By executing this Agreement under the heading of "Sellers'
Representative," Midstream Partners Sellers' Representative LLC (i) accepts
its appointment and authorization to act as the Sellers' Representative as
attorney-in-fact and agent on behalf of Sellers in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and (ii) agrees to perform its obligations under, and
otherwise comply with, this Section 12.13.

(b) If Midstream Partners Sellers' Representative LLC ceases to function in
its capacity as the Sellers' Representative for any reason whatsoever, then
Sellers who held a majority of the Company Interests as of immediately prior
to the Closing shall have the right to appoint a successor Sellers'
Representative.

(c) In the performance of its duties hereunder, the Sellers' Representative
shall be entitled to rely upon any document or instrument reasonably believed
by it to be genuine and accurate. The Sellers' 

Representative may assume that any Person purporting to give any notice in
accordance with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so. In
the absence of proven willful misconduct, (i) the Sellers' Representative
shall not be liable to Sellers with respect to its performance of the
functions specified in this Agreement, and (ii) no Seller shall commence,
prosecute or maintain any actions or proceedings against the Sellers'
Representative with respect to its performance of the functions specified in
this Agreement. In determining the occurrence of any fact, event or
contingency, the Sellers' Representative may request from any of Sellers or
any other Person such reasonable additional evidence as Sellers'
Representative in its sole discretion may deem necessary, and may at any time
inquire of and consult with others, including any of Sellers, and shall not be
liable to any Seller for any damages resulting from any delay in acting
hereunder pending receipt and examination of additional evidence requested.

(d) Each Seller hereby authorizes Buyer and its Affiliates to rely on any
action taken by the Sellers' Representative as having been fully and properly
authorized by the Sellers, and such relying parties shall have no obligation
to investigate whether the Sellers' Representative's actions fall within the
power of attorney granted in this Agreement.

Section 12.14 Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claim or cause of Action based upon, arising under, out of, or in
connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought against, the entities
that are expressly named as Parties in the preamble of this Agreement (the
"Contracting Parties") and then only with respect to the specific obligations
set forth herein with respect to such Contracting Party. No Person that is not
a Contracting Party, including any past, present or future Representative or
Affiliate of any Contracting Party or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing
(each, a "Nonparty Affiliate"), shall have any Liability (whether in contract,
tort, at law or in equity, or granted by statute or otherwise) for any claims,
causes or action or other obligations or Liabilities arising under, out of, or
in connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Financing), or based on, in
respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution,
performance or breach. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, (a)
each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases all such Liabilities,
claims, causes of action and other obligations and Liabilities against any
such Nonparty Affiliates (and the Financing Sources in their capacity as
such), (b) each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases any and all
rights, claims, demands, or causes of action that may otherwise be available
to avoid or disregard the entity form of a Contracting Party or otherwise
impose Liability of a Contracting Party on any Nonparty Affiliate, whether
granted by statute or based on theories of equity, agency, control,
instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise,
piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise, and (c) each
Contracting Party disclaims any reliance upon any Nonparty Affiliates (or the
Financing Sources in their capacity as such) with respect to the performance
of this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in connection
with, or as an inducement to this Agreement.

Section 12.15 Legal Representation. Buyer, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company Group Members)
acknowledges and agrees that Latham and Watkins LLP ("Sellers' Counsel") has
acted as counsel for the Sellers, the Company Group and their respective
Affiliates for several years and that Sellers' Counsel may continue to
represent them in future matters. Accordingly, Buyer, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company Group Members)
expressly 

consents to: (a) Sellers' Counsel' representation of the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates in any post-Closing matter in which the interests of
Buyer and the Company Group, on the one hand, and the Sellers or their
respective Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse, including any matter
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
disagreement or dispute relating thereto, and whether or not such matter is
one in which Sellers' Counsel may have previously advised the Sellers, the
Company Group or their respective Affiliates and (b) the disclosure by
Sellers' Counsel to the Sellers or their respective Affiliates of any
information learned by Sellers' Counsel in the course of its representation of
the Sellers, the Company Group or their respective Affiliates, whether or not
such information is subject to attorney-client privilege or Sellers' Counsel'
duty of confidentiality. Furthermore, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company Group Members)
irrevocably waives any right it may have to discover or obtain information or
documentation relating to the representation of the Sellers or their
respective Affiliates by Sellers' Counsel in the transactions contemplated
hereby, to the extent that such information or documentation was privileged as
to the Sellers or their respective Affiliates. Buyer, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company Group Members)
further covenants and agrees that each shall not assert any claim against
Sellers' Counsel in respect of legal services provided to the Company Group by
Sellers' Counsel in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Upon and after the Closing, each of the Company Group
Members shall cease to have any attorney-client relationship with Sellers'
Counsel, unless and to the extent Sellers' Counsel is specifically engaged in
writing by the Company Group Members to represent the Company Group Members
after the Closing and either such engagement involves no conflict of interest
with respect to the Sellers or their respective Affiliates or the Sellers or
their Affiliates, as applicable, consent in writing at the time to such
engagement. Any such representation of the Company Group Members by Sellers'
Counsel after the Closing shall not affect the foregoing provisions hereof. If
and to the extent that, at any time subsequent to the Closing, Buyer or any of
its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company Group Members) shall
have the right to assert or waive any attorney-client privilege with respect
to any communication between the Company Group Members and any Person
representing them that occurred at any time prior to the Closing, Buyer, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company
Group Members) shall be entitled to waive such privilege only with the prior
written consent of the Sellers.

Section 12.16 Liability of Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, Sellers agree that they shall not have any rights
or claims against any Financing Source (in their capacity as such) in
connection with this Agreement, the Financings or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, and no Financing Source shall have any rights
or claims against any Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives in
connection with this Agreement, the Financings or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise. In addition, in no event will any Financing Source be liable for
consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or indirect damages (including any
loss of profits, business or anticipated savings) or damages of a tortious
nature, except to the extent paid in connection with a claim by a third party.
