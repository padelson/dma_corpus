THE MERGER

 (b) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with Minnesota Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Surviving Corporation"); provided, however, that subsequent to the date hereof Parent may revise the structure of the Merger so long as such restructuring shall have no detrimental effect to the shareholders of the Company. 

   

 (c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file articles of merger with the Secretary of State of Minnesota and make all other filings or recordings required by Minnesota Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as such articles of merger are duly filed with the Secretary of State of Minnesota (or at such later time as may be specified in such articles of merger). 

  

 (d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Minnesota Law. 

  

 _Section 2.02. Conversion of Shares._ 

  

 At the Effective Time, 

  

 (a) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive 1.3 shares of Parent Stock (the "Exchange Ratio") (together with cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock as specified below, the "Merger Consideration"); 

        

 (b) each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; 

  

 (c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation; and 

  

 (d) subject to Section 6.07, the outstanding Company Convertible Notes shall become convertible into that number of shares of Parent Stock that would have been issued if the Company Convertible Notes had been converted into Company Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 _Section 2.03. Surrender and Payment._ 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates"). Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. 

  

 (b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Stock represented by that Certificate. The shares of Parent Stock constituting part of such Merger Consideration, at Parent\'s option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is requested by a holder of shares of Company Stock or is otherwise required under applicable law. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. 

  

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2\. 

  

 (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Stock six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with respect thereto, in respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock one year after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise 

        
  

escheat to or become property of any governmental authority) shall become, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, the property of Parent free and clear
of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

 (f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to securities of Parent constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 2.06, shall be paid to the holder of any Certificates until such Certificates are surrendered as provided in this Section. Following such surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name the securities of Parent have been registered, at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section 2.06 and the amount of all dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously paid or payable on the date of such surrender with respect to such securities. 

  

 _Section 2.04. Stock Options; Stock-Based Awards._ 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, Parent will assume the Company Equity Plans (as defined below) in accordance with the terms thereof. Except as provided in Section 2.04(b), at the Effective Time each of the then outstanding options to purchase shares of Company Stock under any Company Equity Plan (a "Company Stock Option"), whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into, and be deemed to constitute an option (an "Adjusted Option") to acquire, that number of shares of Parent Stock equal to (x) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio and (ii) the per share exercise price for shares of Parent Stock issuable upon exercise of each such Adjusted Option shall be equal to (1) the exercise price per share of Company Stock at which such Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (2) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding up to the nearest whole cent; _provided_ that any fractional share of Parent Stock resulting from an aggregation of all the shares of a holder subject to Company Stock Options shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share; _provided further_ that, for any Company Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under any of Sections 422 through 424 of the Code, the option price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in order to comply with Section 424 of the Code. The Adjusted Stock Option shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including expiration date, vesting and exercise provisions) as were applicable to the corresponding Company Stock Options immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the Parent Board of Directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof. 

  

 (b) Except as provided in Section 2.04(d), at the Effective Time each of the then outstanding Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") and Deferred Stock Units ("DSUs") issued under any Company Equity Plan (a "Company Stock Unit"), whether or not vested, shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into, and be deemed to constitute a right to be issued that number of shares of Parent Stock equal to (x) the number of shares of Company Stock covered by the Company Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio (an "Adjusted Stock Unit"). An Adjusted Stock Unit shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including restrictions, vesting and deferral provisions) as were applicable to the corresponding Company Stock Units immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the Parent Board of Directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof. 

       

    

  (c) Except as provided in Section 2.04(d), at the Effective Time
each then outstanding share of Restricted Stock under any Company Equity
Plan ("Company Restricted Stock"), whether or not vested, shall be converted
into that number of shares of Parent Stock equal to (x) the number of shares
of Company Restricted Stock multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio ("Adjusted
Restricted Stock"). The Adjusted Restricted Stock shall be subject to the
same terms and conditions (including vesting and other restrictions) as were
applicable to the corresponding Company Restricted Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time; _provided_  that the Parent Board of Directors or a
committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the
Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof.

  

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall make any amendments to the terms of such stock option or compensation plans or arrangements that are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.04. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company (or, if appropriate, the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee of the Board of Directors of the Company administering the Company Equity Plans) shall take such action as may be required or desirable to effect the provisions of this Section 2.04, including taking such action as is necessary to avoid the acceleration of the vesting of options or any other grant under the Company Equity Plans, except with respect to any grants, awards or agreements set forth on Section 4.17(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter (as defined below). Except for Non-Qualified Replacement Options granted pursuant to Section 7.11 of the Amended and Restated Inrange Technologies Corporation 2000 Stock Compensation Plan ("Reload Options"), prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary or appropriate action (including amending any of the Company Equity Plans and related award agreements or making adjustments as permitted thereby) to preclude the grant of any additional options or other awards of any type under any of the Company Equity Plans or otherwise from and after the Effective Time. 

  

 (e) Parent shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary for the assumption of the Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.04, including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Stock as is reasonably necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.04.

 _Section 2.06. Fractional Shares._ 

  

 No fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Parent Stock that a holder of shares of Company Stock or Company Restricted Stock or of Company Stock Units would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated and if a fractional share results from such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash without interest determined by multiplying the closing sale price of a share of Parent Stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time by the fraction of a share of Parent Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled. 

  

 _Section 2.07. Withholding Rights._ 

  

 Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, 

        
  

state, local or foreign tax law. If the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Company Stock in respect of which the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the
case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

  

 _Section 2.08. Lost Certificates._ 

   

 If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2\.

with respect to the terms of the Merger for a period of five (5) Business
Days from the date Parent receives written notice of all material terms and
conditions of such original Superior Proposal, as amended or changed
(including any documents related thereto) as set forth in Section 6.03(c) and
such written notice shall specify if the Company and its Board of Directors
intend to take any actions referred to under Section 6.03(b).
