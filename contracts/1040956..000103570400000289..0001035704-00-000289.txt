"Agreement"), among NTT Communications Corporation, a limited liability joint
stock company incorporated under the laws of Japan ("Parent"), Chaser

Company have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein;

         WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, Parent proposes to cause
Sub to make a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time to the extent
permitted under this Agreement, the "Offer") to purchase (i) any and all of the
shares (the "Common Shares") of Common Stock, par value $.001 per share, of the
Company (the "Company Common Stock"), at a purchase price of not less than

date the Offer is commenced; provided, that Sub may, without the consent of the
Company, (i) extend the Offer, if at the scheduled or extended expiration date

have been irrevocably deemed to have been satisfied or waived if Sub elects to
extend the Offer pursuant to clause (iii) of this sentence), subject in the case
of each of clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence to the right of Parent, Sub or
the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof.

         (c) Parent and Sub agree that if at any scheduled expiration date of

                                      -2-
<PAGE>   7

either of the conditions set forth in paragraphs (e) or (f) of Exhibit A shall
not have been satisfied, but at such scheduled expiration date all the
conditions set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (g) and (h) of Exhibit A
shall then be satisfied, or if not then satisfied, are reasonably capable of
being satisfied prior to November 10, 2000, at the request of the Company
(confirmed in writing), Sub shall extend the Offer from time to time (each such
individual extension not to exceed ten business days after the previously
scheduled expiration date, unless the parties otherwise agree), subject to any
right of Parent, Sub or the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the
terms hereof.

         (d) Subject only to the Offer Conditions and so long as this Agreement
has not been terminated in accordance with its terms, Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares validly tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the
expiration of the Offer, and in any event in compliance with the obligations
respecting prompt payment pursuant to Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act.

         (e) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Sub shall file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (the "Schedule TO") with
respect to the Offer, which shall contain as an exhibit or incorporate by
reference an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary
advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to
which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto, the "Offer Documents"), and Parent and Sub shall cause to be
disseminated the Offer Documents to holders of Shares as and to the extent
required by applicable Federal securities laws. Parent, Sub and the Company each
agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Sub further agree to take all
steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO as so corrected to be filed with the
SEC and the other Offer Documents as so corrected to be disseminated to holders
of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Federal
securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents prior to their filing
with the SEC or dissemination to the stockholders of the Company. Parent and Sub
agree to provide the Company and its counsel any comments Parent, Sub or their
counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments. The Company shall
cooperate with Parent and its counsel in responding to any such comments.

         (f) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Sub on a timely
basis the funds necessary to accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares that
Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for, pursuant to the Offer.

         (g) Parent or Sub shall engage an information agent in connection with
the Offer.

         Section 1.2. Company Actions. (a) The Company hereby approves of and
consents to the Offer and represents and warrants that the Board of Directors of
the Company, at a meeting duly called and held, duly adopted, by unanimous vote
of all directors (with the exception of one director who did not participate in
such meeting), resolutions (i) approving this


                                      -3-
<PAGE>   8

Agreement, (ii) approving the Offer and the Merger, (iii) taking all action
necessary to render the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL (as defined below)
inapplicable to the Offer and the Merger, (iv) determining that the terms of the
Offer and the Merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company's
stockholders and (v) recommending that holders of Shares accept the Offer and
that the holders of Common Shares, if applicable, adopt this Agreement. The
Company represents and warrants that its Board of Directors has received the
opinion of Salomon Smith Barney Inc. that the proposed consideration to be
received by holders of Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Merger is fair to
such holders from a financial point of view, and a complete and correct signed
copy of such opinion has been delivered by the Company to Parent. The Company
has been advised by each of its directors and executive officers that each such
person intends to tender all Shares owned by such person pursuant to the Offer.

         (b) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company
shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, as amended from time to
time, the "Schedule 14D-9") containing (unless the Board of Directors of the
Company, after consultation with its independent legal counsel, determines in
good faith that such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
Company stockholders under applicable law) the recommendation described in
Section 1.2(a), and the Company shall cause to be disseminated the Schedule
14D-9 to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable Federal
securities laws. Each of the Company, Parent and Sub agrees promptly to correct
any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to
amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Federal
securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 prior to its filing with the SEC or
dissemination to stockholders of the Company. The Company agrees to provide
Parent and its counsel any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the
receipt of such comments. Parent and Sub shall cooperate with the Company and
its counsel in responding to any such comments.

         (c) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall
cause its transfer agent or agents to furnish Sub promptly with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Shares as of a
recent date and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to such
date, together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position
listings and computer files and all other information in the Company's
possession or control, as Parent may reasonably request and to the extent
reasonably available to the Company, regarding the beneficial owners of Shares
and any securities convertible into Shares, and shall furnish to Sub such
information and assistance (including updated lists of stockholders, security
position listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in
communicating the Offer to the Company's stockholders. Subject to the
requirements of applicable law, and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate
the Merger, Parent and Sub and their agents shall hold in confidence the
information contained in any such labels, listings and files, will use such
information only in


                                      -4-
<PAGE>   9

connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated, will, upon request, deliver, and will use their best efforts to
cause their agents to deliver, to the Company all copies of such information
then in their possession or control.

                                   ARTICLE II

                                   THE MERGER

         Section 2.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
hereof, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, as amended (the "DGCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company
at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined). Following the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall succeed to
and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub in accordance with the DGCL.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at the election of Parent made
prior to the commencement of the Offer or after Sub purchases Shares pursuant to
the Offer, any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary (as hereinafter
defined) of Parent may be substituted for Sub as a constituent corporation in
the Merger, provided that such substitution will not delay or impede
consummation of the Merger. In such event, the parties agree to execute an
appropriate amendment to this Agreement, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and the Company, in order to reflect such substitution.

         Section 2.2. Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective when the
certificate of merger or, if applicable, the certificate of ownership and merger
(each, the "Certificate of Merger"), executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL, is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware; provided, however, that, upon mutual consent of the Constituent
Corporations, the Certificate of Merger may provide for a later date of
effectiveness of the Merger (not to exceed ten days following such filing). When
used in this Agreement, the term "Effective Time" shall mean the date and time
at which the Certificate of Merger is so filed or such later time established by
the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the preceding sentence. The filing
of the Certificate of Merger shall be made on the date of the Closing (as
defined in Section 2.9).

         Section 2.3. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in the DGCL.

         Section 2.4. Charter and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. (a) At the
Effective Time, the Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, of
the Company (the "Company Charter") shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by applicable law. At the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated
Bylaws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by the Company Charter.

                                      -5-
<PAGE>   10

         (b) The directors of Sub at the Effective Time shall be the directors
of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal
or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers
of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal
or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be.

         Section 2.5. Conversion of Securities. (a) As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Sub, the Company or
the holders of any securities of the Constituent Corporations:

         (i) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $.01
     per share, of Sub shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid
     and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

         (ii) All Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company or by any
     wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company and any Shares owned by Parent or by
     any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and no capital
     stock of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
     therefor.

         (iii) Each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
     Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section
     2.5(a)(ii) and other than Dissenting Common Shares (as defined in Section
     2.5(a)(v)) shall be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving
     Corporation in cash, without interest, the per share price paid for Common
     Shares in the Offer (the "Common Share Merger Consideration"). All such
     Common Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
     automatically be canceled and retired and each holder of a certificate
     which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such Common
     Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
     right to receive the Common Share Merger Consideration.

         (iv) Each Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
     the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
     Section 2.5(a)(ii) and other than Dissenting Preferred Shares (as defined
     in Section 2.5(a)(vi)) shall be converted into the right to receive from
     the Surviving Corporation in cash, without interest, the price paid per
     Preferred Share in the Offer (without taking into account the amount paid
     with respect to accumulated and unpaid dividends), plus, if the Effective
     Time is after July 31, 2000, all accumulated and unpaid dividends on such
     Preferred Share from August 1, 2000 to and including the Effective Time
     (the "Preferred Share Merger Consideration"). All such Preferred Shares,
     when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
     be canceled and retired and each holder of a certificate which immediately
     prior to the Effective Time represented any such Preferred Shares shall
     cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
     the Preferred Share Merger Consideration.

                                      -6-
<PAGE>   11

         (v) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if
     required by the DGCL but only to the extent required thereby, Common Shares
     which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
     and which are held by holders who properly exercise appraisal rights with
     respect thereto in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting
     Common Shares") will not be convertible into the right to receive the
     Common Share Merger Consideration, and holders of such Common Shares will
     be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Common Shares
     in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless and until such
     holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or lose their rights to
     appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any
     such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right,
     such Common Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted
     at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Common Share Merger
     Consideration, without any interest thereon. The Company will give Parent
     prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of
     Common Shares. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
     of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
     offer to settle or settle any such demands.

         (vi) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
     if required by the DGCL but only to the extent required thereby, Preferred
     Shares which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
     Time and which are held by holders who properly exercise appraisal rights
     with respect thereto in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the
     "Dissenting Preferred Shares") will not be convertible into the right to
     receive the Preferred Share Merger Consideration, and holders of such
     Preferred Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value
     of such Preferred Shares in accordance with the provisions of such Section
     262 unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw
     or lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the
     Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws
     or loses such right, such Preferred Shares will thereupon be treated as if
     they had been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the
     Preferred Share Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. The
     Company will give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the
     Company for appraisals of Preferred Shares. The Company shall not, except
     with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to
     any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

         (b) Each Company Stock Option (as hereinafter defined) shall be treated
in accordance with Section 6.5.

         Section 2.6. Exchange of Certificates. (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company (or such other
person or persons as shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company)
to act as paying agent in the Merger (the "Paying Agent"), and, from time to
time on, prior to or after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available, or
cause the Surviving Corporation to make available, to the Paying Agent cash in
amounts and at the times necessary for the payment of the Common Share Merger


                                      -7-
<PAGE>   12

Consideration and Preferred Share Merger Consideration (collectively, the
"Merger Consideration") upon surrender of certificates which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented Shares as part of the Merger pursuant to
Section 2.5. Any and all interest earned on funds made available to the Paying
Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid over to Parent.

         (b) Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented Shares (the "Certificates"), (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent and the
Company may reasonably agree prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the
Offer) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration. Upon surrender
of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the Shares theretofore
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section
2.5, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a person other than the
person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 2.6, each Certificate (other than Certificates
representing Dissenting Common Shares or Dissenting Preferred Shares) shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which the
Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted
pursuant to Section 2.5. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash
payable upon the surrender of any Certificate. Parent or the Paying Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as Parent or the
Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code (as hereinafter defined) or under any provisions of
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which
such deduction or withholding was made by the Parent or the Paying Agent.

         (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. All cash paid upon the
surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of


                                      -8-
<PAGE>   13

the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

         (d) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the funds made
available to the Paying Agent to pay the Merger Consideration which remains
undistributed to the holders of Certificates for six months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates
who have not theretofore complied with this Article II and the instructions set
forth in the letter of transmittal mailed to such holders after the Effective
Time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration to which they are entitled.

         (e) No Liability. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.
If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years after
the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any
payment pursuant to this Article II would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity (as hereinafter defined)), the cash payment
in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interests of any person previously entitled thereto.

         (f) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against them with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the amount of cash to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section
2.5.

         Section 2.7. Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if Parent and one or more Subsidiaries of Parent shall own at
least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding Common Shares, Parent and Sub
shall take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become
effective as soon as practicable after expiration of the Offer without a meeting
of stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

         Section 2.8. Further Assurances. If at any time after the Effective
Time the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are
necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or
otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or
under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of
either of the Constituent Corporations, or (b) otherwise to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its proper officers
and directors or their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of either of the Constituent Corporations, all such


                                      -9-
<PAGE>   14

deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to do, in the name and on
behalf of either Constituent Corporation, all such other acts and things as may
be necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm the Surviving
Corporation's right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of such Constituent
Corporation and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

         Section 2.9. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") and all
actions specified in this Agreement to occur at the Closing shall take place at
the offices of Sidley & Austin, Bank One Plaza, 10 South Dearborn Street,
Chicago, Illinois 60603, at 10:00 a.m., local time, no later than the second
business day following the day on which the last of the conditions set forth in
Article VII shall have been fulfilled or waived (if permissible) or at such
other time and place as Parent and the Company shall agree.

                                  ARTICLE III

                REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND SUB

         Parent and Sub represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

         Section 3.1. Organization. Parent is a limited liability joint stock
company incorporated under the laws of Japan. Sub is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its
business as now being conducted. Each of Parent and Sub is duly qualified to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of
its properties owned or held under lease or the nature of its activities makes
such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

         Section 3.2. Authority. On or prior to the date of this Agreement, the
Boards of Directors of Parent and Sub have declared the Merger advisable and the
Board of Directors of Sub has approved this Agreement in accordance with the
DGCL. Each of Parent and Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Sub
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action (including Board
action) on the part of Parent and Sub subject, in the case of this Agreement, to
the filing of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Sub and (assuming the valid
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
validity and binding effect hereof on the Company), it constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of each of Parent and Sub, enforceable against them in
accordance with its terms.

         Section 3.3. Consents and Approvals; No Violations. Assuming that all
consents, approvals, authorizations and other actions described in this Section
3.3 have been obtained and all filings and obligations described in this Section
3.3 have been made, the execution and


                                      -10-
<PAGE>   15

delivery of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions hereof will not, result
in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) under, or give to others a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or result in the loss of a material benefit
under, or result in the creation of any lien, security interest, charge or
encumbrance upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any provision of (i) the Articles of Incorporation or the
Share Handling Regulations of Parent or the Certificate of Incorporation or the
By-Laws of Sub, each as amended to date, (ii) any provision of the comparable
charter or organization documents of any of Parent's Subsidiaries, (iii) any
loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other
agreement, instrument, permit, concession, franchise or license applicable to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (iv) any judgment, order, decree, statute,
law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, other than, in the
case of clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv), any such violations, defaults, rights,
losses, liens, security interests, charges or encumbrances that, individually or
in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, materially
impair the ability of Parent or Sub to perform their respective obligations
hereunder or prevent the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby. No filing or registration with, or authorization, consent or approval
of, any United States (federal and state), foreign or supranational court,
commission, governmental body, regulatory agency, authority or tribunal (a
"Governmental Entity") is required by or with respect to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent or Sub or is necessary for the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except (i) in connection,
or in compliance, with the provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), and the Exchange Act, (ii)
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other
states in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is qualified to do
business, (iii) such filings, authorizations, orders and approvals as may be
required by state takeover laws (the "State Takeover Approvals"), (iv) such
filings as may be required in connection with the taxes described in Section
6.12, (v) applicable requirements, if any, of state securities or "blue sky"
laws ("Blue Sky Laws"), (vi) the voluntary filing of a joint notification
pursuant to Section 721(a) of the Exon-Florio Act, (vii) as may be required
under foreign laws (other than the laws of Japan) and (viii) such other
consents, orders, authorizations, registrations, approvals, declarations and
filings the failure of which to be obtained or made would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, materially impair
the ability of Parent or Sub to perform its obligations hereunder or prevent the

Letter contains a list of (i) all severance and all employment agreements with
employees of the Company and each Subsidiary (other than standard offer letters
providing for at will employment); (ii) all severance agreements, programs and
policies of the Company with or relating to its employees; and (iii) all plans,
programs, agreements and other arrangements of the Company with or relating to
its employees that contain change of control provisions, in each case, other
than those involving amounts that are not material to the Company when
considered in the aggregate. Except as set forth in Section 4.11 of the Company
Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any such
oral or written plan, program, agreement, policy or other arrangement, any stock
option plan, stock appreciation rights plan, restricted stock plan or stock
purchase plan, any of the benefits of which will be increased, or the vesting or
exercisability of the benefits of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence
of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the value of any of
the benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, other than the agreement with the Company's
financial advisor identified in Section 4.19. Except as set forth in Section
4.11 of the Company Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to any agreement, contract or arrangement that could result, separately or

meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

         (b) The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies

Option agreements and the terms of each outstanding compensation protection
agreement are the same in all material respects as the terms of such form
compensation protection agreement. Except as set forth in Section 4.11 of the

         Section 4.12. ERISA. (a) With respect to each employee benefit, bonus,
profit sharing, deferral or incentive compensation, holiday or vacation pay,
personnel policy fringe benefit plan, program, arrangement and contract
(including any "employee benefit plan", as defined in section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")), whether
payable in cash, stock or other property maintained or contributed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries could incur liability under section 4069,
4212(c) or 4204 of ERISA (the "Company Benefit Plans"), the Company has made
available to Parent true and correct copies of (i) the most recent annual report
(Form 5500) filed with the IRS, if any is required by law to be filed, (ii) a
complete copy of such Company Benefit Plan, (iii) each trust agreement relating
to such Company Benefit Plan, if any, (iv) the most recent summary plan
description for each Company Benefit Plan for which a summary plan description
is required, (v) the most recent actuarial report or valuation relating to a
Company Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA and (vi) the most recent
determination letter, if any, issued by the IRS with respect to any Company
Benefit Plan qualified under section 401(a) of the Code.

         (b) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Title
IV of ERISA, if any, (i) the present value of accrued benefits under such
Company Benefit Plan, based upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding
purposes in the most recent actuarial report prepared by such Company Benefit
Plan's actuary with respect to such Company Benefit Plan, did not, as of its
latest valuation date, exceed the then current value of the assets of such
Company Benefit Plan allocable to such accrued benefits, (ii) no "reportable
event" (within the meaning of 4043 of ERISA) has occurred with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan for which the thirty-day notice requirement has not been
waived, except where such reportable event has not had a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company, and (iii) no condition exists that would subject the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to any fine under Section 4071 of ERISA, except where
such conditions will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan"
(as such term is defined in section 3(37) of ERISA).

         (c) With respect to the Company Benefit Plans, no event has occurred
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there exists no condition or set of
circumstances in connection with which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
could be subject to any liability under the terms of such Company Benefit Plan,
ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law, statute, ordinance, rule or
regulation ("Law") that would have, individually in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. Each of the Company Benefit Plans has been
operated and administered in accordance with applicable Laws and governmental
rules and regulations, including ERISA and the Code, except where a violation of
any such Laws, rules or regulations would not have, individually in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each of the Company Benefit
Plans intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of section 401(a) of the
Code has received a favorable determination letter as to such qualification from
the IRS or was established using a prototype plan of a sponsor that has received
a favorable determination letter for the prototype, and no event has occurred,
either by reason of any action or failure to act, which would cause the loss of
any such qualification, except where the loss of such qualification would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. All contributions or other
amounts payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to each
Company Benefit Plan in respect


                                      -21-
<PAGE>   26

of current or prior plan years have been paid or accrued to the extent required
by United States generally accepted accounting principles and Section 412 of the
Code.

         (d) None of the benefits under any Company Benefit Plan will be
increased, nor will the vesting or timing of the payment of any such benefits be
accelerated, as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

         (e) No Company Benefit Plan provides benefits, including death or
medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to current or former
employees of the Company or any Subsidiary beyond their retirement or other
termination of service, other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable Law, (ii)
death benefits or retirement benefits under any "employee pension benefit plan"
(as such term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), (iii) deferred compensation
benefits accrued as liabilities on the books of the Company or Subsidiary or
(iv) benefits the full cost of which is borne by the current or former employee
(or his beneficiary).

         (f) Except as set forth in Section 4.12(f) of the Company Letter, no
Company Benefit Plan is subject to laws outside of the United States.

         Section 4.13. Liabilities. Except as fully reflected or reserved
against in the financial statements included in the Company SEC Documents filed
prior to the date hereof or in the Draft Form 10-Q, or disclosed in the
footnotes thereto, since January 1, 1999 the Company and its Subsidiaries have
incurred no liabilities (including Tax liabilities) or obligations of any
nature, absolute or contingent, other than liabilities or obligations that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company or that would be required by GAAP to be reflected
or reserved in the financial statements of the Company or in the footnotes
thereto, prepared in accordance with GAAP consistent with past practices, other
than in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices.

         Section 4.14. Labor Matters. Except as set forth in Section 4.14 of the
Company Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any material collective bargaining agreement or collective labor contract. To
the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has engaged in any unfair labor practice with respect to any persons employed by
or otherwise performing services primarily for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the "Company Business Personnel"), and there is no unfair labor
practice complaint or grievance against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
by any person pursuant to the National Labor Relations Act or any comparable
state or foreign law pending or threatened in writing with respect to the
Company Business Personnel, except where such unfair labor practice, complaint
or grievance would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. There is no labor strike, dispute, slowdown or stoppage pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that may interfere with the respective business
activities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except where such dispute,
strike or work stoppage would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

suppliers or others as needed), all of the material Company Intellectual
Property that is necessary for the conduct of the Company's or Subsidiaries'
businesses. There are no pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened interferences, re-examinations, oppositions or cancellation
proceedings involving any patents or patent rights, trademarks or trademark
rights, or applications therefor, of the Company or any Subsidiary, except such
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the Knowledge of the Company, there
has been no unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information, trade
secret rights, processes and formulas, research and development results and

use of such information would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the Knowledge

service mark right, copyright or trade secret of any third party that,
individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect on the

forth in Section 4.15 of the Company Letter, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has licensed or otherwise permitted the use by any third party of any
proprietary information or Company Intellectual Property on terms or in a manner
that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.

         Section 4.16. Title to Assets. (a) As of the date hereof, the Company
and the Subsidiaries own, and as of the Effective Time the Company and the
Subsidiaries will own, good and marketable title to all of their assets material
to their business (excluding, for purposes of this sentence, assets held under
leases or assets covered under Section 4.15 hereof), free and clear of any and
all mortgages, liens, encumbrances, charges, claims, restrictions, pledges,
security interests or impositions, except as set forth in Section 4.16 of the
Company Letter and except for such failures or imperfections of title and such
mortgages, liens, encumbrance, charges, claims, restrictions, pledges, security
interests or impositions as would not, independently or in the aggregate,

         (b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any Real
Estate. The leases to all Real Estate occupied by the Company and the
Subsidiaries that are material to the operation of the businesses of the Company
and the Subsidiaries are in full force and effect and to the Knowledge of the
Company, no event has occurred that with the passage of time, the giving of
notice, or both, would constitute a default or event of default by the Company
or any Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other person who is a
party signatory thereto, other than such defaults or events of default which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

         Section 4.17. State Takeover Statutes. The Board of Directors of the
Company has, to the extent such statutes are applicable, taken all action so as
to render the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL inapplicable to the Offer,
the Merger and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof, no other
state takeover statute or similar charter or bylaw provisions are applicable to

(except, in each case, to the extent that the Board of Directors of the Company,

that such action or inaction would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
the Company's stockholders under applicable law): (i) not terminate, amend,
modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to

Takeover Proposal) and (ii) enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, the provisions of any such agreements, including obtaining

         Section 6.1. Stockholder Meeting. (a) Except as otherwise provided in
Section 2.7, following the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Company
will duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of stockholders (the

Agreement and at such meeting call for a vote and cause proxies to be voted in

<PAGE>   34


independent legal counsel, determines in good faith that such action is
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under
applicable law) the Company will, through its Board of Directors, recommend to
its stockholders the adoption of this Agreement, and shall not withdraw or
modify such recommendation. The record date for the Stockholder Meeting shall be
a date subsequent to the date Parent or Sub becomes a record holder of Company
Common Stock purchased pursuant to the Offer.

         (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.7, the Company shall, at
Parent's request, as soon as practicable following the purchase of Shares
pursuant to the Offer, prepare and file a preliminary Proxy Statement with the
SEC and shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments of the
SEC or its staff and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's
stockholders as promptly as practicable after responding to all such comments to
the satisfaction of the staff. Parent shall furnish to the Company such
information concerning itself and Sub as may reasonably be requested by the
Company in connection with the Proxy Statement. The Company shall notify Parent
promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any
request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or for additional information and will supply Parent with copies of
all correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy

shall occur any event that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its
stockholders such an amendment or supplement. The Company shall not mail any
Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, to which Parent
reasonably objects. Parent shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation
of the Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, including the
supply of any information required to be included in the Proxy Statement
regarding Parent or Sub.

         (c) Parent agrees to cause all Common Shares purchased pursuant to the
Offer and all other Common Shares owned by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to
be voted in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement.

         Section 6.2. Access to Information. Subject to currently existing
contractual and legal restrictions applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
afford to the accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives
of Parent reasonable access to, and permit them to make such inspections as they
may reasonably require of, during the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Effective Time, all of their respective properties, books,

and the work papers of independent accountants, if available and subject to the
consent of such independent accountants) and, during such period, the Company

or state securities laws, (ii) furnish promptly to Parent all other information

                                      -30-
<PAGE>   35

to such inspections. No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall affect
any representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto. All information obtained by
Parent pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall be kept confidential in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement dated April 7, 2000 between Parent and the
Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

         Section 6.3. Directors. Promptly after such time as Sub purchases
Shares pursuant to the Offer, Sub shall be entitled, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, to designate at its option up to that number of directors,
rounded to the nearest whole number, of the Company's Board of Directors,
subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act, as will make the
percentage of the Company's directors designated by Sub equal to the percentage
of the aggregate voting power of the shares of Company Common Stock held by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that if Sub's designees
are elected to the Board of Directors of the Company, until the Effective Time
such Board of Directors shall have at least three directors who are directors of
the Company on the date of this Agreement (the "Continuing Directors"); and
provided further that, in such event, (i) if the number of Continuing Directors
shall be reduced below three for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Continuing
Directors or Director shall designate a person or persons to fill such vacancy
or vacancies, each of whom shall be deemed to be an Continuing Director for
purposes of this Agreement or (ii) if no Continuing Directors then remain, the
other directors shall designate three persons to fill such vacancies who shall
not be officers or affiliates of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or
officers or affiliates of Parent or any of its subsidiaries, and such persons
shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for purposes of this Agreement, and
in the case of either clause (i) or (ii) Sub shall cause such person or persons
to be elected to fill such vacancy or vacancies. Following the election or
appointment of Sub's designees pursuant to this Section 6.3 and prior to the
Effective Time, any amendment, or waiver of any term or condition, of this
Agreement or the Company Charter or the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the
Company, any termination of this Agreement by the Company, any extension by the
Company of the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of Sub or Parent or waiver or assertion of any of the Company's rights
hereunder, and any other consent or action by the Board of Directors of the
Company with respect to this Agreement, will require the concurrence of a
majority of the Continuing Directors and, except as required by applicable law,
no other action by the Company, including any action by any other director of
the Company, shall be required for purposes of this Agreement. To the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall take all action requested
by Parent that is reasonably necessary to effect any such election, including
mailing to its stockholders the Information Statement containing the information
required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder, and the Company agrees to make such mailing with the mailing of the
Schedule 14D-9 (provided that Sub shall have provided to the Company on a timely
basis all information required to be included in the Information Statement with
respect to Sub's designees). In connection with the foregoing, the Company will
promptly, at the option of Parent, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
Company Charter and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company, either
increase the size of the Company's Board of Directors and/or obtain the
resignation of such number of its current directors as is necessary to enable
Sub's designees to be elected or appointed to the Company's Board of Directors
as provided above.

         (b) The Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, in same day funds to
Parent the following amounts, if applicable, under the circumstances and at the
times set forth as follows:

         (i) if Parent or Sub terminates this Agreement under Section 8.1(d),
     the Company shall pay the Expenses of Parent and the Termination Fee upon
     demand;

         (ii) if the Company terminates this Agreement under Section 8.1(e), the
     Company shall pay the Termination Fee within one business day following
     such termination and the Expenses of Parent upon demand; or

         (iii) if Parent or Sub terminates this Agreement under Section 8.1(c)
     as a result of the breach by the Company of any covenant or agreement
     contained in this Agreement resulting in a failure of the condition set
     forth in paragraph (f) of Exhibit A and at the time of any such termination
     a Takeover Proposal shall have been made (other than a Takeover Proposal
     made prior to the date hereof), (x) the Company shall pay the Expenses of
     Parent upon demand, and (y) if concurrently therewith or within 12 months
     thereafter, (A) the Company enters into a merger agreement, acquisition
     agreement or similar agreement (including a letter of intent) with respect
     to a Takeover Proposal, or a Takeover Proposal is consummated, involving
     any party (1) with whom the Company had any discussions with respect to a
     Takeover Proposal, (2) to whom the Company furnished information with
     respect to or with a view to a Takeover Proposal or (3) who had submitted a
     proposal or expressed any interest publicly in a Takeover Proposal, in the
     case of each of clauses (1), (2) and (3), prior to such termination, or (B)
     the Company enters into a merger agreement, acquisition agreement or
     similar agreement (including a letter of intent) with respect to a Superior
     Proposal, or a Superior Proposal is consummated, then, in the case of
     either (A) or (B) above, the Company shall pay the Termination Fee upon the
     earlier of the execution of such agreement or upon consummation of such
     Takeover Proposal or Superior Proposal.

         (c) If Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement under Section
8.1(b)(i)(y) and at the time of such termination all Offer Conditions except the
Exon-Florio Condition have been satisfied or waived, then Parent shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to the Company, in same day funds, an amount equal to the
Expenses of the Company upon demand.

         Section 6.5. Company Stock Options. (a) Prior to the consummation of
the Offer, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, a
committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions and take any and all other
action necessary or appropriate to cause each Company Stock Option that is
outstanding as of the consummation of the Offer to be canceled as of the
consummation of the Offer, in consideration for which the holder thereof (an
"Option


                                      -32-
<PAGE>   37

Holder") shall receive the right to receive from the Company cash in an amount
(the "Option Consideration") equal to (A) the product of (1) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such option and (2) the excess, if
any, of the Offer Price over the exercise price per share for the purchase of
Company Common Stock subject to such option, minus (B) all applicable federal,
state and local Taxes required to be withheld in respect of such payment,
subject to the requirements set forth below.

         (i) In the case of a Company Stock Option or portion thereof that is
     exercisable at, on account of or before consummation of the Offer, the
     Option Consideration shall be paid as soon as reasonably practicable
     following the acceptance for payment of shares by Sub pursuant to the Offer
     and the surrender of such Company Stock Option or portion thereof to the
     Company; and

         (ii) In the case of a Company Stock Option or portion thereof that is
     not exercisable at the time the Offer is consummated, the Option
     Consideration shall be paid to such Option Holder after (A) the end of the
     calendar month which includes the date on which such option or portion
     thereof would have become exercisable pursuant to the terms of the
     applicable Company Stock Option agreement had such option or portion
     thereof not been canceled and been assumed by a successor and (B) the
     surrender of such Company Stock Option or portion thereof with respect to
     such option to the Company; and in the case of any such Company Stock
     Option that by its terms could not under any circumstances, if it were
     assumed, be exercised or become exercisable after consummation of the
     Offer, excluding any such option that pursuant to its terms becomes fully
     exercisable if not assumed or replaced prior to the consummation of the
     Offer, if the employment of an Option Holder is terminated by the Company
     (or any of its related entities) within 12 months after the Offer is
     consummated for any reason other than Cause (as defined below) as
     determined by the Company, the next installment of Option Consideration
     with respect to such Option shall be payable. An Option Holder's rights to
     Option Consideration under this clause (ii) shall be evidenced by an
     agreement in such form as the Board of Directors of the Company (or if
     appropriate, a committee thereof) shall approve with terms substantially
     similar to those of the Company Stock Option to which the such right to
     Option Consideration relates and are not inconsistent with the terms
     hereof. As used herein, "Cause" means the Option Holder: (1) acts in bad
     faith and to the detriment of the Company; (2) refuses or fails to act in
     accordance with any specific direction or order of the Company; (3)
     exhibits in regard to his employment unfitness or unavailability for
     service, unsatisfactory performance, misconduct, or incompetence, but not
     on account of disability; (4) exhibits dishonesty or habitual neglect; or
     (5) is convicted of a crime involving dishonesty, breach of trust, or
     physical or emotional harm to any person.

         The surrender of a Company Stock Option in exchange for an agreement to
receive the Option Consideration as contemplated by this Section 6.5(a) shall be
deemed a release of any and all rights the Option Holder had or may have had in
respect thereof.


                                      -33-
<PAGE>   38

         (b) The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that (i) the
Purchase Period (as defined in the Company Stock Purchase Plan) applicable to
the options outstanding under the Company Stock Purchase Plan (each, a "Purchase
Plan Option") is shortened so as to have an Exercise Date (as defined in the
Company Stock Purchase Plan) that occurs before the acceptance for payment by
Sub of Shares pursuant to the Offer; and (ii) no current holder of a Purchase
Plan Option is permitted to increase his or her rate of payroll deduction under
the Company Stock Purchase Plan from and after the date hereof, except for any
such increases a participant is entitled to elect in accordance with the terms
of the Company Stock Purchase Plan as in effect on the date hereof.

         (c) The Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that,
effective as of acceptance for payment by Sub of Shares pursuant to the Offer,
(i) the Company Stock Option Plans, the Company Stock Purchase Plan and any
similar plan or agreement of the Company shall be terminated, (ii) any rights
under any other plan, program, agreement or arrangement relating to the issuance
or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall be terminated, and (iii) no Option Holder or
holder of any Purchase Plan Option will have any right to receive any shares of
capital stock of the Company or, if applicable, the Surviving Corporation, upon
exercise of any Company Stock Option or Purchase Plan Option.

         (d) The Company represents and warrants that it has the power and
authority under the terms of the Company Stock Purchase Plan and each of the
Company Stock Option Plans to comply with this Section 6.5 without the consent
of any Option Holder or holder of any Purchase Plan Option.

         Section 6.6. Hiway Warrants. Prior to the acceptance for payment of any
Shares by Sub pursuant to the Offer, the Company will use reasonable best
efforts to obtain written confirmation, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, from the holders of the Hiway Warrants that after the
Effective Time of the Merger each such Hiway Warrant will represent the right to
receive an amount equal to (A) the product of (1) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Hiway Warrant and (2) the excess, if any,
of the Common Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share for
the purchase of the Company Common Stock subject to such Hiway Warrant, minus
(B) all applicable federal, state and local Taxes required to be withheld in
respect of such payment.

         Section 6.7. Reasonable Best Efforts. (a) Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including: (i) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents and
approvals from all Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities) and the

waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity
(including those in connection


                                      -34-
<PAGE>   39

with the HSR Act, Exon-Florio, any other pre-merger filings and State Takeover
Approvals), (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers
from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to
have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (iv) the execution and delivery of
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. No party to this Agreement shall consent to any voluntary
delay of the consummation of the Offer or the Merger at the behest of any
Governmental Entity without the consent of the other parties to this Agreement,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

         (b) Each party shall use all reasonable best efforts to not take any
action, or enter into any transaction, which would cause any of its
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement to be untrue or result
in a breach of any covenant made by it in this Agreement.

         (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, in connection with any filing or submission required or action to be
taken by either Parent or the Company to effect the Offer, the Merger and to
consummate the other transactions contemplated hereby, the Company shall not,
without Parent's prior written consent, commit to any divestiture transaction,
and neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to divest or hold
separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom
of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, the Company or any of the
businesses, product lines or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or that
otherwise would have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

         Section 6.8. Public Announcements. Parent and the Company will not
issue any press release with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise issue any written public statements with respect to such
transactions without prior consultation with the other party, except as may be
required by applicable law or by obligations to the Nasdaq National Market or
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange.

         Section 6.9. State Takeover Laws. If any "fair price," "business
combination" or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or
regulation shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby,
Parent and the Company and their respective Boards of Directors shall use their
reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on the transactions
contemplated hereby.

         Section 6.10. Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance. (a)
From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to indemnify, defend and hold harmless (and make advances as incurred to) all
past and present officers and directors of the Company and of its Subsidiaries
to the same extent and in the same manner such persons are entitled to
indemnification and advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by
the Company pursuant to the DGCL, the Company Charter or the Company's Amended
and Restated Bylaws for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time.

<PAGE>   40

         (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving

policy or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the
best available coverage; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall
not be required to pay an annual premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of 200%
of the last annual premiums paid prior to the date hereof (which premiums are
set forth in Section 6.10(c) of the Company Letter), but in such case shall
purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount.

         (d) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and may be enforced by, each person entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Section 6.10.

         Section 6.11. Notification of Certain Matters. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to give prompt notice to Parent, of: (i)
the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or

it to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (y) any covenant,
condition or agreement contained in this Agreement and made by it not to be
complied with or satisfied in all material respects, (ii) any failure of Parent
or the Company, as the case may be, to comply in a timely manner with or satisfy
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder or (iii) any change or event which would be reasonably likely to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; provided, however, that the delivery

any penalties or interest with respect thereto, payable in connection with the
consummation of the Offer and the Merger. The Company shall cooperate with
Parent in the filing of any returns with respect to the Gains Taxes, including
supplying in a timely manner a complete list of all real property interests held
by the Company and its Subsidiaries and any information with respect to such
properties that is reasonably necessary to complete such returns. The portion of
the consideration allocable to the real properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall be determined by Parent in its reasonable discretion. The
stockholders of the


                                      -36-

the Company Senior Notes to such amendments of the related indentures as Parent
shall determine or (ii) make a tender offer to purchase any or all of the series
of the Company Senior Notes (which tender offer may also include solicitation of
consents to the amendment of the related indentures) at such price or prices and
such terms as shall be determined by Parent. Parent and the Company shall
cooperate in the preparation of any documentation to be sent to the holders of
Company Senior Notes in connection with any such consent solicitation or tender
offer. It shall be a condition to the obligation of the Company to complete any
such consent solicitation or tender offer that Sub purchase Shares pursuant to

its Subsidiaries, or maintained for the benefit of any employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, and honor all annual bonus awards made by the

the Surviving Corporation to provide employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with benefits (including welfare benefits) that are no less
favorable taken as a whole, than the benefits provided under the Company's and
such Subsidiary's benefits plans (other than equity-based plans) as in effect on
the date hereof. To the extent that service is relevant for eligibility, vesting
or benefit calculations or allowances (including entitlements to vacation and
sick days) under any plan or arrangement of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
Parent shall ensure that such plan or arrangement shall credit employees for
service on or prior to the Effective Time with the Company or any of its

<PAGE>   43

         (i) if (x) as a result of the failure of any of the Offer Conditions
     the Offer shall have terminated or expired in accordance with its terms
     without Sub having accepted for payment any Shares pursuant to the Offer or
     (y) Sub shall not have accepted for payment any Shares pursuant to the

     this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(i) shall not be available to
     any party whose failure to perform any of its obligations under this
     Agreement results in the failure of any such condition or if the failure of
     such condition results from facts or circumstances that constitute a breach
     of any representation or warranty under this Agreement by such party; or

         (ii) if any Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or
     ruling or taken any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or

     shall have become final and nonappealable;

         (c) by Parent or Sub prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the
Offer in the event of a breach by the Company of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement which (i) would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in paragraph (e) or (f) of Exhibit
A and (ii) cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after the giving of
written notice to the Company;

         (d) by Parent or Sub if either Parent or Sub is entitled to terminate
the Offer as a result of the occurrence of any event set forth in paragraph (d)
of Exhibit A;

         (e) by the Company if the Board of Directors of the Company determines
that a Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Board of
Directors determines, in its good faith judgment, after consultation with
independent counsel, that failing to terminate this Agreement would be
inconsistent with such Board's fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided
that the Company has complied in all material respects with all provisions of
Section 5.2, including the notice provisions therein, and that it has complied
to the extent applicable with the requirements of Section 6.4(b) relating to the
payment (including the timing of any payment) of the Expenses and the
Termination Fee to the extent required by Section 6.4(b); and provided further
that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(e) unless and until 72 hours have elapsed following delivery to Parent of a
written notice of such determination by the Board of Directors of the Company
(such notice may be given by the Company contingent on termination of this
Agreement becoming effective immediately prior to the Company entering into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal);

         (f) by the Company, if (i) any of the representations or warranties of
Parent or Sub set forth in this Agreement that are qualified as to materiality
shall not be true and correct in any respect or any such representations or
warranties that are not so qualified shall not be true and correct in any
material respect, or (ii) Parent or Sub shall have failed to perform in any


                                      -39-

material respect any material obligation or to comply in any material respect
with any material agreement or covenant of Parent or Sub to be performed or
complied with by it under this Agreement and such untruth, incorrectness or
failure cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after the giving of
written notice to Parent or Sub, as applicable; or

         (g) by the Company, if the Offer has not been timely commenced in
accordance with Section 1.1.

         The right of any party hereto to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.1 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless
of any investigation made by or on behalf of any party hereto, any person
controlling any such party or any of their respective officers or directors,
whether prior to or after the execution of this Agreement.

         Section 8.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Parent or the Company, as provided in Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability hereunder
on the part of the Company, Parent, Sub or their respective officers or
directors (except for the last sentence of Section 6.2 and the entirety of
Section 6.4, which shall survive the termination); provided, however, that
nothing contained in this Section 8.2 shall relieve any party hereto from any
liability for any breach of a representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement, the breach of any covenant contained in this Agreement or for fraud.

         Section 8.3. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto, subject to Section 6.3, by or pursuant to action taken by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of the
Company, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law
requires further approval by such stockholders without such further approval.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.

         Section 8.4. Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject
to Section 6.3, the parties hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein which may legally be waived. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party.

other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the

manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

     assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and
     its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to compel the Company or Parent to
     dispose of or hold separate any material portion of the business or assets
     of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and its
     subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each case, as a result of the Offer or

               VERIO AND NTT COMMUNICATIONS SIGN MERGER AGREEMENT

TOKYO, MAY 8, 2000 - NTT Communications Corporation ("NTT Communications") and
Verio Inc. (NASDAQ: VRIO) announced today that the companies have entered into a
definitive merger agreement in which NTT Communications will acquire all of the
shares of Verio at a price of $60 per share of common stock. The boards of
directors of both companies have approved the transaction. The transaction
values Verio at approximately $5.5 billion, excluding approximately $500 million
attributable to NTT Communications' current shareholdings in Verio.

The agreement provides for a U.S. subsidiary of NTT Communications to commence a
tender offer no later than May 17, 2000, for all of the outstanding shares of
Verio's common and preferred stock. The tender offer is subject to customary
terms and conditions, including the tender of that number of shares of common
stock that, together with the shares of Verio common stock currently owned by
NTT Communications, constitute at least a majority of Verio's outstanding shares
of common stock on a fully diluted basis. NTT Communications currently holds
approximately 10 percent of the outstanding shares of Verio common stock, which
it acquired from Verio in May 1998. The transaction is expected to be completed
in the third quarter of 2000.

NTT Communications, a subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT)
Corporation (NYSE: NTT), has been expanding its global network services and
IP-based services, primarily focusing on Asia, to meet the growing demand for
corporate data communications services over the Internet. Verio is a provider of
comprehensive Web-hosting and Internet services, currently hosting more than
400,000 sites, with an emphasis on serving the fast-growing market of small- and
medium-sized businesses. Verio also operates a Tier One Internet backbone
network in the U.S.

The proposed combination will enable NTT Communications and Verio to provide
their existing and potential customers with both high-quality IP network
services and advanced Web-based business solutions. This will be realized by
combining the established IP network of NTT Communications in Asia and Verio's
Web-based business solution capabilities in the U.S. Together, NTT
Communications and Verio would have the ability to meet the needs of customers
of all sizes, from the largest multinational corporations to the newest
Web-centric start-ups, throughout the Pan Pacific region and the U.S.

"The proposed acquisition of Verio is an important step for NTT Communications,"
said Masanobu Suzuki, President and Chief Executive Officer of NTT
Communications. "In the arena of global business, we have been focusing on
expanding network services globally and providing them through IP networks.
Another pivotal point is to have business footholds in Asia. The proposed
acquisition of Verio gives an important leverage for expanding our global
business in the U.S.

"By combining the IP networks and services of the two companies, we will be
able to offer 'one-network' IP solutions under a single-policy operating
structure," Mr. Suzuki said. "These include having the ability to transmit
mission-critical data across the two networks and to furnish a uniform level of
quality and services.

"When completed, the combination of our two companies will facilitate
competition in the Internet sector in the U.S., by delivering resources,
capabilities and experience to meet the large, diverse and growing
telecommunications needs of all businesses, including large global enterprises,
multi-national corporations, and Web-centric firms," said Mr. Suzuki.

"Since completing our original investment in Verio in 1998, our companies have
established a mutually successful strategic relationship. We expect a successful
acquisition to provide a basis for the global expansion of our services in a
full-fledged manner. In the long-run, I believe this acquisition will have a
positive impact not only on our customers worldwide, but on our financial
foundation," Mr. Suzuki said.

"We believe that this agreement represents an excellent value for our
shareholders and an exciting future for our customers, employees and sales
channel partners," said Justin L. Jaschke, Founder, Chief Executive Officer and
Director of Verio. "This transaction brings together two of the world's leading
Internet companies to form an even stronger global IP competitor. The explosive
growth of the online economy is forcing businesses of all sizes to compete in a
global market. This combination further enhances our ability to meet the
expanding needs of these companies and to accelerate the growth of our business
in the U.S. and around the world."

"With our world-leading hosting platforms, Tier One network and strong global
distribution, we expect to play a key role in the development of NTT
Communications' international business," Mr. Jaschke said.

Verio's comprehensive services include:

     o   Customer Web site hosting on shared or dedicated servers, or
         co-location of customers' own hardware at Verio data centers;

     o   Application hosting services that make business-focused software and
         database applications available to customers via the Internet;

     o   E-commerce platforms and services in a variety of configurations, from
         entry-level storefronts to sophisticated solutions for online merchants
         requiring highly secure, real-time payment settlement;

     o   Internet connectivity services including dedicated access, DSL access,
         and dial-up access;

     o   Domain name registration for customers seeking to establish a Web
         address;

     o   Virtual private networks, and managed security services to enable
         dedicated, secure transmission of private traffic.

NTT Communications expects its proposed combination with Verio to generate
several specific benefits to customers, shareholders of NTT, and the new
Internet economy generally:

     o   The combined company will integrate NTT Communications' Asia IP network
         and Verio's Web hosting and e-business solution capabilities in the
         U.S., giving the company the ability to offer a "one network" solution
         to its customers in both Asia and the U.S.

     o   NTT Communications will be able to provide more value-added services
         and strengthen its sales and service offerings by utilizing Verio's
         know-how in IP network operations, e-business services and highly
         capable sales force.

     o   The acquisition will facilitate investments and development for new
         global IP services such as IP-VPN and global Web content caching.

Verio also expects a range of benefits to result from synergies of the proposed
merger:

     o   Through the proposed combination, the high-quality Web hosting services
         and e-commerce platforms of Verio will be made available to Asian
         countries, giving Pan-Pacific customers, including ASPs, content
         providers, and other e-businesses, access to e-business support.

     o   Verio will be able to quickly expand its client base in the U.S. and
         Asia markets.

     o   Having a strong business position in Pan-Pacific areas will enable
         Verio, together with NTT Communications, to expand into Europe more
         effectively.

NTT Communications believes that Verio's management and its dedicated team of
2,000 employees are important assets. No change in Verio's management personnel
is anticipated, and the Verio brand name will be retained.

The purchase of shares pursuant to the offer would be followed by a merger that
would result in non-tendering holders of Verio common stock and preferred stock
receiving the same prices per share as tendering holders.
