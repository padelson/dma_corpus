THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made December 5,
2011, by and among United Pet Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_
"); Fido Newco Corp., an Indiana corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent (" _Newco_ "); FURminator, Inc., an Indiana corporation (the "
_Company_ "); and Hammond, Kennedy, Whitney and Company, Inc., a New York
corporation, as the Stockholder Representative. The foregoing parties to this
Agreement are each a " _Party_ " and collectively the " _Parties_."
Capitalized terms used in this Agreement without definition shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in this Agreement.

BACKGROUND STATEMENT

The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Newco and the Company have each
approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, and deemed it advisable and in the best interests of
their respective corporations and stockholders that the Parties consummate
the Merger and the other transactions provided for herein and, in the case of
Newco and the Company, have recommended them to their stockholders. As a
condition and inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this
Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company, who collectively beneficially
own at least 85% of the outstanding voting shares of Company Common Stock,
prior to or simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
have executed and delivered a written consent of stockholders dated as of the
date hereof in the form of _Exhibit A_ attached hereto approving this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger.
Certain stockholders of the Company, who collectively beneficially own at
least 85% of the outstanding voting shares of Company Common Stock, have
entered into a Transaction Support Agreement for the benefit of Parent (the "
_Transaction Support Agreement_ "), pursuant to which such stockholders have
agreed, among other things, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Transaction Support Agreement, to the indemnification obligations
of the Company Stockholders set forth in this Agreement and the restrictive
covenants set forth therein.

STATEMENT OF AGREEMENT

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained herein, and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows: ARTICLE I.

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 The Merger. 

At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of the Laws of the State of Indiana
(" _Indiana Law_ "), Newco shall be merged with and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ "), the separate corporate existence of Newco shall cease, and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation. The Company, as the
surviving corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to
as the " _Surviving Corporation_."

 

Section 1.2 Effective Time; Closing.

 

Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing Articles of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Indiana (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") (the time of such
filing being the " _Effective Time_ ") as soon as practicable on or after the
Closing Date. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
(a) at the offices of Sutherland Asbill and Brennan LLP, 999 Peachtree Street,
N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30309, at 10:00 a.m., local time on December 27, 2011,
or, if earlier or later, the fourth (4th) Business Day after the conditions
set forth in  _Article VII_ are satisfied or waived by the Party or Parties
entitled to waive them, or (b) at such other place and time as the Parties may
agree (the " _Closing Date_ ").

 

Section 1.3 Effect of the Merger.

At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of Indiana Law.

 

Section 1.4 Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.

 

At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of the Company in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended by virtue of the
Merger in the form of _Exhibit B_ attached hereto and, as so amended, shall be
the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by Indiana Law. At the
Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and
restated in their entirety by virtue of the Merger to be identical to the
Bylaws of Newco as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (with the
name of the corporation appropriately changed to that of the Surviving
Corporation), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by Indiana Law.

 

Section 1.5 Directors and Officers.

 

(a) The directors of Newco immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and the officers of Newco
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the

(b) Parent shall deliver the Escrow Fund to U.S. Bank National Association, as

Expenses. Parent shall cause such funds to be used as follows:

(i) With respect to that portion of the Closing Transaction Expenses

consideration and exchange for the right to receive an amount of cash equal
to the Per Share Merger Consideration _multiplied_ _by_ the number of Warrant
Shares issuable upon exercise of such Warrant, to be paid in accordance with
the procedures set forth in _Section 2.8_. Upon the Closing, each Warrant
will be deemed canceled, terminated, retired and extinguished, and the Company
Stockholder previously holding such Warrant shall have no further rights with
respect thereto other than the right to the consideration for his or
its Warrant Shares described herein. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Company shall take any and all actions that are necessary to cause the
Warrants to be terminated as set forth in this _Section 2.3_. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Warrant Shares_ " shall mean the number of shares of
Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of a Warrant outstanding

-5-  Section 2.4 Dissenting Shares.

 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the shares
of Company Common Stock which are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and with respect to which dissenters rights shall have been
properly demanded in accordance with Indiana Law (" _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into the right to receive, or be exchangeable for, the
Per Share Merger Consideration but, instead, the holders thereof shall be
entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Indiana Law; _provided,_ _however_ , that (i) if any
holder of Dissenting Shares (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") shall
subsequently deliver a written withdrawal of his demand for appraisal of such
shares, or (ii) if any Dissenting Stockholder fails to establish his
entitlement to dissenters rights, such Dissenting Stockholder shall forfeit
the right to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock, such shares
shall cease to be Dissenting Shares, such holder shall cease to be
a Dissenting Stockholder and each of such shares shall thereupon be converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon, in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_.

 

Section 2.5 Pre-Closing Adjustments Based on Estimated Working Capital.

 

(a) On or before the second (2nd) Business Day prior to the anticipated
Closing Date, a Parent employee designated by Parent and a Company employee
designated by the Company shall jointly prepare and mutually agree upon a
certificate duly executed by each of them setting forth in reasonable detail
the computation of the estimated Working Capital of the Company as of the
close of business on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Working
Capital_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Working Capital_ " means, as
of a particular date, (i) the current assets of the Company as of the close
of business on such date, excluding customer accounts receivable in excess of
ninety (90) days past due, _minus_ (ii) the current liabilities of the Company
as of the close of business on such date, which current liabilities will
include the costs and expenses incurred and to be incurred by the Company in
connection with the tooling and molds for the supplier arrangement with
Hankscraft and the costs and expenses of reworking the inventory, in each case
as described in _Exhibit D_ , that have not been paid prior to the Closing
Date, each prepared in accordance with the accounting principles, methods and
practices utilized in preparing the Companys Audited Financial Statements and
in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis ( _provided_ that
where there is an inconsistency between such accounting principles, methods,
and practices and GAAP, GAAP shall control), except (w) for variances from
such accounting principles, methods and practices and GAAP otherwise provided
for in this definition of Working Capital, (x) in the event the calculation of
Estimated Working Capital and/or Closing Working Capital utilizes a category
of current assets or current liabilities that was not utilized in the
preparation of the Target Amount as set forth in _Exhibit D_ , other than with
respect to the specific assets and liabilities that are expressly described as
excluded from the calculation of the Target Amount in Note 1 to _Exhibit D_ ,
appropriate adjustments to the Target Amount shall be made to reflect the
inclusion of such category of current assets and/or current liabilities in the
calculation of the Target Amount using the same methodology as used in the
calculation of the Target Amount set forth in _Exhibit D_ ; (y) any liability
constituting

 



-6-   Indebtedness or Company Transaction Expenses and taken into account in the
calculation of the Aggregate Merger Consideration in _Section 2.1(c)(i)_ as
of the Closing Date or paid under  _Section 2.2(d)_ shall not be included as
a current liability for purposes of the Working Capital calculation, and (z)
any assets infused by Parent or any of its Affiliates on the Closing Date and
any liabilities of the Surviving Corporation arising on the Closing Date as a
result of Parents acquisition of the Company pursuant to the Merger will not
be included in the calculation of Working Capital. In the event the designees
cannot agree on a particular item or items, the determination of the designee
of Parent with respect thereto shall control for purposes of the computation
of the Estimated Closing Working Capital.

(b) At the Closing, based solely on the Estimated Working Capital set forth in
the certificate contemplated by _Section 2.5(a)_: (i) if the Estimated
Working Capital is less than six million sixty-nine thousand dollars
($6,069,000) (the " _Target Amount_ "), then the Gross Amount shall be
decreased by the amount of such difference; and (ii) if the Estimated Working
Capital is greater than the Target Amount, then the Gross Amount shall be
increased by the amount of such difference.

 

Section 2.6 Post-Closing Adjustments Based on Closing Working Capital.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable and in any event no later than ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to have
prepared and delivered to the Stockholder Representative a balance sheet of
the Company, prepared as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the "
_Closing Balance Sheet_ "), together with a statement certified by the Chief
Financial Officer of Parent (the " _Parent Working Capital Statement_ ")
setting forth in reasonable detail the Working Capital of the Company as of
the close of business on the Closing Date, based upon the amounts set forth
on the Closing Balance Sheet; and in addition, taking into account as current
liabilities on the Closing Balance Sheet and the Parent Working Capital
Statement any Indebtedness that should have been deducted from the Gross
Amount pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)(i)(A)(x)_ but was not (the " _Closing
Working Capital_ "). The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance
with the accounting principles, methods and practices utilized in preparing
the Companys Audited Financial Statements and in accordance with GAAP,
applied on a consistent basis ( _provided_ that where there is an
inconsistency between such accounting principles, methods, and practices
and GAAP, GAAP shall control), and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Working
Capital shall be calculated in accordance with the definition of "Working
Capital" under _Section 2.5(a)_.

 

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to give the Stockholder
Representative and its Representatives reasonable access to all of its books,
records, personnel, accountants, offices and other facilities and properties
as the Stockholder Representative may require to review the Closing Balance
Sheet and the Parent Working Capital Statement. If the Stockholder
Representative believes that the calculation of the Closing Working Capital
was not determined in the manner required by _Section 2.6(a)_, then the
Stockholder Representative may, within 45 days after delivery of the Closing
Balance Sheet and Parent Working Capital Statement, deliver a notice (the "
_Dispute Notice_ ") to Parent, setting forth the Stockholder Representatives
calculation of the Closing Working Capital and 

 



-7-   specifying in reasonable detail those items or amounts affecting the
calculation as to which it disagrees and the reasons for such disagreement. If
prior to the conclusion of such 45-day period the Stockholder Representative
notifies Parent in writing that it will not provide a Dispute Notice or if a
Dispute Notice is not delivered within such 45-day period, the Closing Working
Capital as set forth in the Parent Working Capital Statement shall become
final, conclusive and binding on the Parties for all purposes of this _Section
2.6_.

(c) If the Stockholder Representative delivers a Dispute Notice as provided
in _Section 2.6(b)_, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts in order to finally determine the Closing Working Capital. If Parent
and the Stockholder Representative do not resolve all disputed items or
amounts set forth in the Dispute Notice within thirty (30) days after delivery
of such Dispute Notice, or as such 30-day period may be extended by mutual
agreement of Parent and the Stockholder Representative, the remaining disputed
items and amounts will be submitted by Parent and the Stockholder
Representative to McGladrey and Pullen, LLP (the " _Dispute Accountants_ ") for
resolution of such disputed items and amounts. Parent and the Stockholder
Representative will have the opportunity to present their positions with
respect to such disputed items and amounts to the Dispute Accountants, and
such disputed items and amounts shall be resolved by the Dispute Accountants
in accordance with the requirements of _Section 2.6(a)_ and this _Section
2.6(c)_. The Dispute Accountants shall prepare a written report setting forth
the resolution of such disputed items and amounts and calculating the revised
amount of such Closing Working Capital, which shall be delivered to each of
Parent and the Stockholder Representative promptly, but in no event later
than sixty (60) days after such disputed items and amounts are submitted to
the Dispute Accountants. Such revised amount of such Closing Working Capital
shall not reflect any difference from the amount of such Closing
Working Capital set forth on the Parent Working Capital Statement other than
differences required to reflect the resolution of such disputed items and
amounts by the Dispute Accountants. The revised amount of the Closing Working
Capital set forth on the Dispute Accountants written report and the written
report shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the Parties, absent
arithmetical error, and shall be deemed a final arbitration award that is
enforceable against each of the Parties in any court of competent
jurisdiction. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent the Dispute
Accountants written report purports to make any determination with respect to
anything other than the disputed items and amounts submitted to the
Dispute Accountants, it shall be disregarded by the Parties. Each of Parent
and the Stockholder Representative shall execute a reasonably acceptable
engagement letter if requested to do so by the Dispute Accountants, and shall
provide reasonable access to their respective employees and Representatives
who are responsible for financial matters. The fees and expenses of the
Dispute Accountants incurred in the resolution of the items in dispute shall
be allocated by the Dispute Accountants to each particular item in dispute
and such fees with respect to each such item in dispute shall be allocated and
paid by Parent and the Stockholder Representative, in inverse proportion to
the extent they prevailed on each such item in dispute, which allocations
shall be determined by the Dispute Accountants and reflected in its final
report. For example, if the Parties submit a dispute to the Dispute
Accountants in which the Stockholder Representative claims that a component of
Closing Working Capital is $50,000.00 greater than the amount of such
component as calculated by Parent, and the Dispute Accountants ultimately
resolves the dispute by awarding the Company Stockholders $30,000.00 of the
$50,000.00 contested, then the costs and expenses of arbitration for such
item in dispute will be allocated 60% (i.e., 30,000.00 ÷ 50,000.00) to Parent
and 40% (i.e., 20,000.00 ÷ 50,000.00) to the Stockholder Representative.

 



-8-  (d) Upon the final determination of the Closing Working Capital in accordance
with this  _Section 2.6_: (i) if the Closing Working Capital exceeds the
Estimated Working Capital, then such difference plus interest on the aggregate
amount at the Applicable Rate accruing from the Closing Date through the date
of payment shall be paid to the Exchange Agent by Parent, and the Working
Capital Holdback will be paid to the Exchange Agent in accordance with
_Section 2.6(f)(ii)_; and (ii) if the Estimated Working Capital exceeds the
Closing Working Capital, then such difference, plus interest on such amount
at the Applicable Rate accruing from the Closing Date through the date of
payment (such difference plus such interest is the " _Shortfall Amount_ ")
shall be paid to Parent by the Company Stockholders (severally in accordance
with their respective Pro-Rata Shares) in the manner provided in _Sections
2.6(e)_ and _2.6(f)_ , and any remaining balance of the Working Capital
Holdback after such payment, if any, shall be paid to the Exchange Agent in
accordance with _Section 2.6(f)(ii)_. All payments under this _Section
2.6(d)_ shall be made within five (5) Business Days after final determination
in accordance with this  _Section 2.6_ in cash (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds). All payments to the Exchange Agent under this
_Section 2.6(d)_ shall be for the benefit of the Company Stockholders (other
than Dissenting Stockholders) and for distribution by the Exchange Agent to
the Company Stockholders (other than Dissenting Stockholders) in accordance
with their respective Pro-Rata Shares. The " _Applicable Rate_ " means the
rate of 2.5% per annum. 

(e) If payment is due from the Company Stockholders to Parent under _Section
2.6(d)_, then such payment shall be made from the following sources until
such payment has been made in full: (i) first, from the Working Capital
Holdback held by the Escrow Agent, (ii) second, from the Escrow Fund, to the
extent the Escrow Fund contains cash at such time; and (iii) third, the
Company Stockholders (severally in accordance with their respective Pro-Rata
Shares) promptly shall deliver to the Parent cash in an amount equal to the
remaining difference.

 

(f) Upon the final determination of the Closing Working Capital in accordance
with this _Section 2.6_, each of Parent and the Stockholder Representative
shall, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, instruct the
Escrow Agent to pay (i) to Parent the amounts owed to Parent under _Sections
2.6(e)(i)_ and _2.6(e)(ii)_ , if any, and (ii) the balance of the Working
Capital Holdback to the Exchange Agent after payment of any amounts owed to
Parent under _Sections 2.6(e)(i)_ and _2.6(e)(ii)_ , if any, to be paid by the
Exchange Agent in accordance with _Section 2.8(c)_. 

Section 2.7 Rights as Stockholders; Stock Transfers.

 

At the Effective Time, the Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist and holders of Company
Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, stockholders of
the Company, other than (a) to receive any dividend or other distribution with
respect to such Company Common Stock with a record date occurring prior to
the Effective Time, (b) the consideration provided under this _Article II_ and
(c) the appraisal rights in the case of Dissenting Shares. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company
or the Surviving Corporation of any Company Common Stock.

 



-9-  Section 2.8 Exchange Procedures; Deposit of Merger Consideration.

(a) _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a
financial institution mutually agreed to by Parent and the Stockholder
Representative to act as exchange agent for the Merger (in such capacity, the
" _Exchange Agent_ ") and shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the Company Stockholders the Aggregate
Merger Consideration after giving effect to the adjustment contemplated by
_Section 2.5_ but prior to the adjustment contemplated by _Section 2.6_,
_less_ the amounts withheld pursuant to _Sections 2.2(a)_ , _(c)_ and _(d)_
(such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") to be
paid pursuant to this _Article II_ in exchange for Company Common Stock and
Warrants issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time.

(b) _No Interest_. No interest will be paid or accrued on any of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration that any holder of Company Common Stock or
Warrants shall be entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article II_.

 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall mail or make available to each holder of record
of a certificate or certificates representing issued and outstanding Company
Common Stock or a Warrant (i) a notice advising such holder of the Merger and
the procedure for surrendering to the Exchange Agent such certificate or
certificates or Warrants in exchange for the consideration set forth in
_Section 2.1(c)_ and _Section 2.3_ deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement and which notice shall specify that delivery shall be
effected and risk of loss and title to the certificates and Warrants
theretofore representing Company Common Stock and Warrants shall pass only
upon proper delivery of such certificates and Warrants to the Exchange Agent,
and (ii) a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_
(a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") by which such holder will represent and agree,
among other things, as to such holders ownership of the Company Common Stock
and/or Warrants (as applicable) free of liens, mortgages, security interests,
pledges, charges, other rights of third parties or other encumbrances
(collectively, " _Liens_ ") other than with respect to the
Company Stockholder Agreement. Upon the surrender of each Company Certificate
and/or Warrant (as applicable) and a properly completed and duly executed
Letter of Transmittal by a Company Stockholder, the Exchange Agent shall pay
to such Company Stockholder an amount equal to the Per Share Merger
Consideration available on the Closing Date multiplied by the sum of (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock duly surrendered by such Company
Stockholder, plus (y) the number of Warrant Shares with respect to any
Warrants duly surrendered by such Company Stockholder. In the event such
payment is made by the Exchange Agent with respect to a Company Stockholder at
a time before the Closing Working Capital has been finally determined and
appropriate payments have been made under _Section 2.6_ and a payment is
thereafter made by Parent to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.6_,
the Exchange Agent shall distribute to such Company Stockholder his or
its Pro-Rata Share of any such payment. In the event such payment is made by
the Exchange Agent with respect to a Company Stockholder at a time after the
Closing Working Capital has been finally determined and appropriate payments
have been made under  _Section 2.6_, (A) the amount of the payment required
under this _Section 2.8(c)_ with respect to such Company Stockholder shall
include such Company Stockholders Pro-Rata Share of the payment made by
Parent under  _Section 2.6(d)(i)_, or (B) if the Shortfall Amount exceeds
the sum of the Working Capital Holdback and the amount of cash in the Escrow
Fund, the amount of the payment required under this _Section 2.8(c)_ with
respect to such Company Stockholder shall be decreased by such Company
Stockholders Pro-Rata Share of the payment(s) made to Parent under _Section
2.6(e)(iii)_, if any.

 



-10-  (d) _Unregistered Transferees_. If any Per Share Merger Consideration is to
be issued or paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered Company Certificate or Warrant, as applicable, is registered, then
the Per Share Merger Consideration may be issued or paid to such a transferee
so long as (i) the surrendered Company Certificate or Warrant, as applicable,
is accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect that transfer,
and (ii) the Person requesting such exchange (A) pays any applicable transfer
Taxes or (B) establishes to the satisfaction of Parent and the Exchange Agent
that any such Taxes have already been paid or are not applicable.

(e) _Unclaimed Merger Consideration_. Promptly following the date that is two
(2) years after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the
Surviving Corporation all cash, certificates and other documents in its
possession relating to the transactions described in this Agreement; and any
holders of Company Common Stock or Warrants who have not theretofore complied
with this _Article II_ may look thereafter only to the Surviving Corporation
for the Aggregate Merger Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to
this _Article II_ , in each case, without any interest thereon. Any such
portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Common
Stock or Warrants immediately prior to the time that such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall,
to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent
nor any Party shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock or
Warrant for any cash to be paid as part of the Aggregate Merger Consideration
which has been delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws.

_No Recourse Against Parent_. Each Company Stockholder shall not have the
right to bring any claim against Parent or the Surviving Corporation for any
amounts owed to such Company Stockholder to the extent of the amount paid by
Parent to the Stockholder Representative or the Exchange Agent (for the
benefit of such Company Stockholder) hereunder.

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Company Certificate or Warrant has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, Parent may at its option require the making of an
affidavit in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent of that fact
by the Person claiming such Company Certificate or Warrant to be lost, stolen
or destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable form
and such amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Company Certificate or Warrant, as a
condition of any payments under this Agreement to such Person with respect to
such Company Certificates or Warrants.

 

(i) _Withholding_. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock or Warrants such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any applicable Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, such withheld

 



-11-   amounts may be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holders of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction
and withholding were made by Parent or the Exchange Agent. Parent or the
Exchange Agent, to the extent the Person withholding sums pursuant to this
_Section 2.8(i)_, shall (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to in the
case of Parent) timely pay such withheld amounts to the applicable Government
Authority.

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Newco as of the date hereof
as follows, except as set forth in the letter delivered by the Company to

letter from the IRS, both as to the original plan and all restatements or
material amendments (or is entitled to rely on a favorable opinion or advisory
letter issued by the IRS with respect to a

 



-21-   master and prototype or volume submitter plan); (ii) has never been subject
to any assertion by any Governmental Authority that it is not so qualified;
and (iii) no circumstances exist which are reasonably likely to result in
revocation of any such favorable determination, opinion or advisory letter. No
Employee Plan is subject to an audit by the IRS, DOL or any other Governmental
Authority nor is it the subject of any voluntary compliance program, amnesty
program, closing agreement or other similar programs, and no completed audit,
compliance filing, closing agreement or similar action or agreement has
resulted in the imposition of any Tax or other Liability that has not been
satisfied.

(f) _Accruals; Funding_.

 

(i) _Section 3.14(f)_ of the Disclosure Letter fully and accurately sets
forth any funding Liability under each Employee Plan whether insured or
otherwise, including any liabilities under any retiree medical arrangement and
any insured plan that provides for retroactive premium or other adjustments.

 

(ii) _Contributions_. The Company and each ERISA Affiliate have made full
payment of all amounts required to be contributed under the terms of each
Employee Plan and applicable Law, or required to be paid as expenses under
such Employee Plan, including administrative and related expenses, on or
before their due dates or within the applicable grace period for payment
without default, and no excise taxes may be assessed as a result of any
nondeductible or other contributions made or not made to an Employee Plan.

(g) _Reporting and Disclosure_. Summary plan descriptions and all other
returns, reports, registration statements, prospectuses, documents, statements
and communications that are required to have been filed, published or
disseminated under the Code, ERISA or other Law and the rules and regulations
promulgated by the Treasury Department, the DOL or by the SEC or any other
Governmental Authority with respect to the Employee Plans have been so filed,
published or disseminated.

(h) _Claims for Benefits_. Other than claims for benefits arising in the
ordinary course of the administration and operation of the Employee Plans, no
claims, investigations or arbitrations are pending or threatened against any
Employee Plan, the Company, any ERISA Affiliate, any trust or arrangement
created under or as part of any Employee Plan, any trustee, fiduciary,
custodian, administrator or any other Person holding or controlling assets of
any Employee Plan, and no basis to anticipate any such claim or claims exists.

as set forth in _Section 3.14(i)_ of the Disclosure Letter:

(i) neither the Company, any ERISA Affiliate, any Employee Plan, any trust
or arrangement created under any of them, nor any trustee, fiduciary,
custodian, administrator or any other Person holding or controlling assets of
any of the Employee Plans has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as such
term is defined in ERISA or the Code) that could subject any of the foregoing
Persons, or any Person dealing with them, to any Tax, penalty or other cost or
Liability of any kind; and

 



-22-  (ii) no termination, whether partial or complete, has occurred with
respect to any Employee Plan.

(j) _Creation of Obligations By Reason of the Merger_. Except as set forth
in  _Section 3.14(j)_ of the Disclosure Letter, the execution and delivery
of the Company Delivered Agreements and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Company Delivered Agreements will not constitute an event
under any Employee Plan that will or may result in any payment (whether
severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness,
vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits
with respect to any Participant, including any obligation to make a payment
that would be nondeductible under Code Section 280G or any other Code
provision. There is no Contract or plan to which the Company is a party or by
which it is bound to compensate any individual for excise taxes paid pursuant
to Code Section 4999\.

(k) _Employee Recharacterization._ Neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has or could have any Liability arising from the recharacterization
of any Person engaged by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate as an independent
contractor, lease employee, consultant or similar service provider as an
Employee of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate.

(l) _Code Section 409A_. Each Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (as defined under Code Section 409A(d)(1)) has been
maintained and operated so that no Tax has been or could reasonably be
expected to be incurred under Code Section 409A.

 

(m) _Certain Employment and Labor Laws_. With respect to all of its employees
(as defined in Section 274a.1(f) of Title 8, Code of Federal Regulations),
the Company has complied in all material respects with the Immigration Reform
and Control Act of 1986 and all regulations promulgated thereunder (" _IRCA_
") with respect to the completion, maintenance and other documentary
requirements of Forms I-9 (Employment Eligibility Verification Forms) for all
current and former employees and the reverification of the employment status
of any and all employees whose employment authorization documents indicated a
limited period of employment authorization. _Section 3.14(m)_ of the
Disclosure Letter contains a true and complete list of all employees of the
Company who are not citizens of the United States of America and who are not
permanent residents of the United States of America, together with a true and
complete list of the visa status and visa expiration dates of each such

authorized to work in the United States. The Company has not received any
written notice of any inspection or investigation relating to its alleged
noncompliance with or violation of IRCA, nor has it been warned, fined or
otherwise penalized by reason of any failure to comply with IRCA.

(n) With respect to each Employee Plan established or maintained outside of
the U.S. (a " _Foreign Employee Plan_ "), in addition to the foregoing
representations, each of the following is true and correct: (i) the fair
market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Employee Plan, the liability
of each insurer for any Foreign Employee Plan funded through insurance or the
book reserve established for any Foreign Employee Plan, together with any
accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued
benefit obligations with respect to all current and former participants in
such plan

 



-23-   according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to
determine employer contributions to such Foreign Employee Plan and no
transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or
insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations and (ii) each
Foreign Employee Plan required to be registered has been registered and has
been maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities.

of the FTC or the Antitrust Division should be appealed or contested will be
solely within the discretion of Parent.

 

(e) _Foreign Filings_. The Parties will act similarly with respect to any
requirements of the applicable Law of any other countries.

(f) _Certain Representations and Warranties_. None of the information supplied
or to be supplied by a Party for inclusion in any regulatory filings prepared

(collectively, the " _Regulatory Filings_ ") by it, will, at the respective
time the Regulatory Filings or any amendments or supplements to them are
filed with the appropriate Governmental Authorities, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement any act or
event should be discovered by a Party which the applicable Law requires to be
set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Regulatory Filings,
then such Party will promptly so inform the others and will furnish all

or permanent injunction against the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or enter into a consent decree or other commitment containing such
Partys agreement to hold separate or divest any of its or its
Affiliates plants, assets or businesses, or agree to any limitations on its
or its Affiliates conduct or actions, and in no event shall any Party be
required to take any of the foregoing actions; and (ii) nothing herein shall
require any Party to take any action with respect to compliance with the HSR

(" _Losses_ ") arising out of actions or omissions in their capacities as
such occurring at or prior to the Closing to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, the Companys Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws (in
each case as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date) and any
agreement between a DandO Indemnified Party and the Company in effect at the
date of this Agreement, including advancing expenses incurred in the defense
of any action or Claim, _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Company shall
pay for only one counsel for all DandO Indemnified Parties unless the use of one
counsel for such DandO Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a
conflict of interest and (ii) such advancement of expenses shall be subject
to such DandO Indemnified Partys agreement to return any advanced funds if a
court of competent jurisdiction, after all time for appeals having been
exhausted, shall have determined that the DandO Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnity against such expenses under applicable Law or the
Companys Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.

(b) If for any reason the indemnity provided for in _Section 5.9(a)_ is
unavailable to any DandO Indemnified Party or is insufficient to hold each such
DandO Indemnified Party harmless from all such Losses, then the Company and its
successors shall each contribute to the amount paid or payable by such DandO
Indemnified Party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the
relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such DandO
Indemnified Party, as the case may be, on the other but also the relative
fault of such Person as well as any relevant equitable considerations (it
being expressly agreed that the DandO Indemnified Parties to whom this 
_Section 5.9_ applies are hereby made express and intended third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.9_).

(c) The obligations of the Company under this _Section 5.9_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO
Indemnified Party to whom this  _Section 5.9_ applies (it being expressly
agreed that the DandO Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies
are hereby made express and intended third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 5.9_ ).

liability tail or similar coverage extending for a period of six (6) years
from the Closing Date having the amount and nature of coverage for
professional liability (including amounts, policy

coverage shall be Company Transaction Expenses.

 

Section 5.10 Employee Matters.

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause the Company

employee listed in _Section 5.10_ of the Disclosure Letter (each, a "
_Transferred Employee_ ").

(b) Parent or its Affiliates shall provide each Transferred Employee with
compensation and benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
to the compensation and benefits provided by the Parent or its Affiliates to
similarly situated employees. Parent or its Affiliates shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that health, dental and life insurance benefits
are provided without any gap in coverage. The phrase "without any gap in
coverage" means that there will be no waiting period for participation in such
plans, actively-at-work requirements or any restrictions or limitations with
respect to pre-existing conditions with respect to any Transferred
Employee or his or her spouse or dependents, except to the extent that such
waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements or any restrictions or
limitations with respect to pre-existing conditions were not or would not have
been satisfied or waived under the comparable Employee Plan immediately
before the Closing Date. With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan
maintained by Parent and its Affiliates for the benefit of any Transferred
Employees, Parent or its Affiliates, as applicable, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each Transferred Employee to be given credit under
such plan for all amounts paid by such Transferred Employee under any similar
Employee Plan for the plan year that includes the Closing Date for purposes
of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such
amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
applicable plan maintained by Parent or its Affiliates, as applicable, for the
plan year in which the Closing Date occurs. Parent or its Affiliates will
credit each Transferred Employee with the service of such Transferred Employee
with the Company up to the Closing Date, to the extent such service is
recorded in such the Companys records as of the Closing Date, to the same
extent as if such service had been performed for Parent or its Affiliates for
purposes of determining such Transferred Employees eligibility for and
vesting in, and entitlements under all employee benefit plans other than with
respect to accruals under any defined benefit pension plan.

 



-41-  (c) Nothing herein shall (i) guarantee employment of any Transferred Employee
for any period of time after the Closing Date or preclude the ability of
Parent or any of its Affiliates to terminate the employment of any Transferred
Employee for any reason or no reason, or (ii) require Parent or any of its
Affiliates to continue any particular employee benefit plan or arrangement
after the Closing Date. No provision of this _Section 5.10_ shall create any
third-party beneficiary or other rights in any current or former employee of
the Company (including any dependent or beneficiary thereof) or any other
Person. Parent or any of its Affiliates, as applicable, shall have the right
in its sole discretion to amend, modify, terminate or adjust benefit levels
under any and all employee benefit plans and arrangements covering the
Transferred Employees after the Closing Date, subject to this _Section 5.10_.
No provision of this _Section 5.10_ is intended to modify, amend or create
any employee benefit plan or arrangement of the Company or Parent or any
Affiliate of the Company or Parent.

(d) _Plan Terminations._ At least fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing

dental, life and disability plans and to cease contributions to its 401(k)

to terminate its medical and dependent care flexible spending account plan
under Section 125 of the Code and its health reimbursement arrangement which
provides reimbursement of certain deductibles under its health care plan
effective as of December 31, 2011.

(e) The Company will take no actions that will require Parent or any of
its Affiliates to give notice or otherwise comply with the Workers Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act (the " _WARN Act_ "). Parent will be
responsible for any action after the Closing that results in a "mass
layoff" or "plant closing" under the WARN Act, exclusive of any "employment
losses," as defined under the WARN Act, effected by the Company before the
Closing Date.

 

(f) _Cafeteria Plan and Health Reimbursement Arrangement Continuation._
_Section 5.10(f)_ of the Disclosure Letter lists (i) all individuals who
will become Transferred Employees and who are participants in the Companys
Code Section 125 health and dependent care flexible spending account plan (the
" _Company FSA Plan_ ") (each such Transferred Employee a " _Company FSA
Participant_ "), together with the elections made prior to the date hereof
with respect to such accounts through the Closing Date and the amounts
previously reimbursed under the Company FSA Plan to each Company FSA
Participant and (ii) all individuals who will become Transferred Employees and
who are participants in the Companys self-insured Medical Deductible
Reimbursement Plan (the " _Company HRA Plan_ ") (each such Transferred
Employee a " _Company HRA Participant_ "), the annual amount credited under
the Company HRA Plan for the Company HRA Participants and the aggregate amount
of claims paid to date under the Company HRA Plan for each Company HRA
Participant. The Company will update _Section 5.10(f)_ of the Disclosure
Letter as of the Closing Date and provide such updated Schedule to the Parent
on the Closing Date. No later than 15 days before the Closing Date, the
Company will provide Parent with documentation from the third-party
administrator for the Company FSA Plan and the Company HRA Plan (" _BeneFLEX_
") binding BeneFLEX to continue providing administrative services with
respect to the Company FSA Plan and the Company HRA Plan until all of the
affairs of such plans have been settled in accordance with their terms and
Applicable Law. If the 

 



-42-   Company does not provide the foregoing documentation, before the Closing
Date the Company will take all actions necessary to terminate the Company FSA
Plan and the Company HRA Plan as of the Closing Date, and the Company
Stockholders will retain responsibility for any actions required to wind up
the Company FSA Plan and the Company HRA Plan in accordance with their terms
and Applicable Law. The Company represents and covenants that as of the
Closing Date it has or shall have properly withheld from the pay of Company
FSA Participants all amounts in accordance with their Company FSA Plan
elections. This _Section 5.10(f)_ shall be interpreted and administered in a
manner consistent with Rev. Rul. 2002-32.

Section 5.11 Conduct of Business of Newco.

 

During the period of time from the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time, Newco shall not engage in any activities of any nature except as
provided in or contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.12 Notice of Certain Matters.

The Company shall give Parent notice of (a) any product recall or any Claim,
or to the Companys Knowledge, threatened Claim, against the Company relating
to product liability, (b) the occurrence of any Material Adverse Effect, (c)
the loss of any listings with any of the Companys top fifteen (15) customers
(based on the amount of revenue generated during the nine months ended
September 30, 2011), (d) any fact, event, circumstance, occurrence or change
that would cause any of the Companys representations and warranties set forth
in this Agreement to no longer be true and correct or which the Company would
be required to disclose in the certificate to be delivered pursuant to
_Section 7.2(d)_, or _(e)_ any information that was incorrect in the
Disclosure Letter, together with the correct information. Notices pursuant to
this _Section 5.12_ shall be given promptly and in no event later than two
(2) Business Days after the Company becomes aware of the fact, event,
circumstance, occurrence, change or item requiring such notice. In the event
a notice contemplated by clause (d) above (x) results solely from any action
taken pursuant to _Section 5.1(b)_ with the written consent of Parent, then
such notice shall be deemed (solely as of the Closing Date) to automatically
amend and supplement the Disclosure Letter with respect thereto, or (y) is
made solely with respect to the issuance of Company Common Stock as expressly
permitted by _Section 5.1(b)(iii)_ and  _(ix)_ or the transfer of not more
than 250,000 shares of Company Common Stock by a Company Stockholder for
estate planning purposes, then such notice shall be deemed (solely as of the
Closing Date) to automatically amend and supplement  _Section 3.2(a)_ of the
Disclosure Letter with respect thereto (any amendment and supplement to the
Disclosure Letter under clause (x) or (y) above, a " _Permitted Update_ ").
Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, no such notice will affect
Parents rights under this Agreement, including Parents rights to
indemnification under _Articles VI_ and _IX_. For the avoidance of doubt, no
transfer of Company Common Stock under clause (y) above affects in any way
the condition set forth in _Section 7.2(g)_ that Company Stockholders holding
not less than 99% of the Company Common Stock and 100% of the Warrant Shares
shall have executed or agreed to be bound by the Transaction Support
Agreement.

Section 5.13 Information Statement.

 

The Company has prepared an information statement in the form of a letter with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Information Statement_ "),

 



-43-   in form and substance acceptable to Parent, and has provided it to the
Company Stockholders a reasonable period prior to their execution of the
Company Written Consent. The Company shall provide the Information Statement,
with such changes as required to give effect to execution of the Company
Written Consent, to the remaining Company Stockholders on or as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement. The Company covenants that
none of the information in the Information Statement, at the time the
Information Statement was first published, sent or given to the Company
Stockholders, and at any time it is amended or supplemented, contained or will
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; _provided_ that the Parties acknowledge that the estimates in
the Information Statement of the consideration to be received by the Company
Stockholders are only estimates that the Company believes in good faith to be
reasonable based on the facts and circumstances and are not statements of
fact. If the Company becomes aware prior to the Closing Date of any
information that would cause any of the statements in the Information
Statement (other than changes in the estimated proceeds due Company
Stockholders) to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or
to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein
not false or misleading, the Company shall take the necessary steps to correct
and redistribute the Information Statement if appropriate.

Section 5.14 Customer Investigation.

 

After the date of this Agreement, the Company shall allow Parent to contact
any customer set forth on _Section 3.21_ of the Disclosure Letter; provided
that all such contacts shall be scheduled at a time agreeable to Parent, the
Company and each respective customer and a representative of the Company may
if the Company wishes participate in such contact.

 

Section 5.15 Stockholder Approval of Parachute Payments.

 

The Company will take all actions required to obtain valid approval of the
holders of the Company Common Stock in the manner set forth in Section
280G(B)(5) of the Code with respect to payments that would otherwise
constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code.

suffered or incurred (each a " _Tax Loss_ " and collectively, the " _Tax
Losses_ ") arising out of:

 

(a) Taxes of the Company for periods or portions thereof ending on or before
the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Taxes_ "), in excess of the amount of Taxes
which are specifically identified as current liabilities (excluding any
reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) in the Closing Working Capital;

 



-44-  (b) Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary
group of which the Company is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date
by reason of Liability under Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6, Treasury
Regulation §1.1502-78 or comparable provision of foreign, state or local Law,
excluding any Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or
unitary group of which the Company becomes a member on the Closing Date on or
after the Closing (or at any time after the Closing Date) and any Taxes which
are specifically identified as current liabilities (excluding any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) in the Closing Working Capital;

(c) Taxes or other payments with respect to periods or portions thereof ending
on or before the Closing Date which are required to be paid after the date
hereof by the Company to any party under any agreement relating to the

arrangement (whether written or not) (" _Tax Sharing Agreement_ ") or by
reason of being a successor-in-interest or transferee of another entity; and

(d) without duplication, (x) a breach of or inaccuracy in any representation
or warranty set forth in _Section 3.15_ or in the certificate delivered by

shall be determined without reference to any materiality qualifier with
respect thereto; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Claims for breach or
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty in _Section 3.15_ shall be made
within 60 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations,
including waivers.

Section 6.2 Tax Indemnification Procedures.

(a) After the Closing, Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholder
Representative in writing of any demand, claim or notice of the commencement
of an audit received from any Governmental Authority or any other Person with
respect to Taxes for which the Company Stockholders are liable pursuant to
_Section 6.1_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that a failure to give such notice
will not affect the Parent Indemnified Parties rights to indemnification
under this _Article VI_, except to the extent that the Company Stockholders
are actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall contain factual
information (to the extent known) describing the asserted Tax Liability and
shall include copies of the relevant portion of any notice or other document
received from any Governmental Authority or any other Person in respect of
any such asserted Tax Liability.

 



-45-  (b) Payment by the Company Stockholders of any amount due to the Parent
Indemnified Parties under this _Article VI_ shall be made within ten (10)
Business Days following written notice by a Parent Indemnified Party that
payment of such amounts to the appropriate Governmental Authority or other
applicable third party is due by a Parent Indemnified Party, _provided_ ,
that the Company Stockholders shall not be required to make any payment
earlier than five (5) Business Days before it is due to the appropriate
Governmental Authority or applicable third party. In the case of a Tax that
is contested in accordance with the provisions of _Section 6.3_, payment of
such contested Tax will not be considered due earlier than the date a "final
determination" to such effect is made by such Governmental Authority or a
court of competent jurisdiction. For this purpose, a "final determination"
shall mean a settlement, compromise, or other agreement with the relevant
Governmental Authority, whether contained in an IRS Form 870 or other
comparable form, or otherwise, or such procedurally later event, such as a
closing agreement with the relevant Governmental Authority, and agreement
contained in an IRS Form 870-D or other comparable form, an agreement that
constitutes a "determination" under Section 1313(a)(4) of the Code, a
deficiency notice with respect to which the period for filing a petition with
the Tax Court or the relevant state, local or foreign tribunal has expired or
a decision of any court of competent jurisdiction that is not subject to
appeal or as to which the time for appeal has expired.

(c) All amounts required to be paid pursuant to this _Article VI_ shall be
paid promptly in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank
account designated by the indemnified party. In seeking indemnification under
this _Article VI_ against the Company Stockholders, the Parent Indemnified
Parties shall first exercise their remedies with respect to the Escrow Fund
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and, if the Escrow Fund has been exhausted in
full, with respect to the Company Stockholders in accordance with the terms
hereof.

(d) Any payments required pursuant to this _Article VI_ that are not made
within the time period specified in this _Section 6.2_ shall bear interest at
a rate and in the manner provided in the Code for interest on underpayments of
federal income Tax and, in the case of payments related to Taxes other than
U.S. federal income Taxes, at a rate and in the manner provided under
applicable Law for underpayments of such Tax.

 

Section 6.3 Company Tax Audits and Contests; Cooperation.

 

(a) After the Closing Date, Parent shall control the conduct of any audit,
claim for refund, or administrative or judicial proceeding of the Company
involving Taxes (any such audit, claim for refund, or proceeding referred to
herein as a " _Contest_ "). The Stockholder Representative shall have the
right to participate in any such Contest that relates to Taxes for which the
Parent Indemnified Parties are indemnified under _Section 6.1(a)_ ("
_Participation Contest_ ") at its own expense and Parent shall not settle,
compromise and/or concede any portion of such Participation Contest if such
resolution is reasonably likely to give rise to a Liability for Taxes for
which the Parent Indemnified Parties would be indemnified under _Section
6.1(a)_, without the consent of the Stockholder Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(b) Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information (including access to books and records) and assistance relating to
the Company as is reasonably requested 

 



-46-   for the filing of any Tax Returns and the preparation, prosecution, defense
or conduct of any Contest. Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall
reasonably cooperate with each other in the conduct of any Contest or other
proceeding involving or otherwise relating to the Company (or their income or
assets) with respect to any Tax and each shall execute and deliver such powers
of attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of
this _Section 6.3_. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall make
available to the Stockholder Representative promptly upon written request and
for as much time as reasonably required for purposes of reviewing or filing
any Pre-Closing Company Returns and Straddle Returns or participating in any
Participation Contest any one or more of those employees of the Company or
Parent or their Affiliates (as specifically requested by the Stockholder
Representative) who prior to the Closing were involved in the preparation of
Tax Returns or the conduct of Contests; _provided_ , that neither Parent nor
any of its Affiliates shall have any obligation to continue the employment of
any employees; and  _provided_ , _further_ , neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any Liability to the Stockholder Representative for the
acts or omissions of its employees under this _Section 6.3(b)_. Nothing in
this  _Section 6.3(b)_ shall require any of Parent or its Affiliates to
undertake any action that could unreasonably interfere with, or otherwise
cause an undue burden on, the activities of Parent or its Affiliates. The
Stockholder Representative shall reimburse Parent for Parents or its
Affiliates reasonable out-of-pocket costs paid to third parties in satisfying
its obligations under this _Section 6.3(b)_ with respect to the Stockholder
Representative. Any information obtained under this _Section 6.3(b)_ shall
be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns or in the conduct of a Contest or other Tax
proceeding.

 

(c) Parent shall (i) properly retain and maintain the Tax and accounting
records of the Company that are in its possession after the Closing Date and
that relate to Pre-Closing Taxable Periods and Straddle Periods for seven
years and shall thereafter provide the Stockholder Representative with written
notice prior to any destruction, abandonment or disposition of all or
any portions of such records of the Company; (ii) transfer such records to
the Stockholder Representative upon its written request prior to any such
destruction, abandonment or disposition; and (iii) allow the Stockholder
Representative and its Representatives, at times and dates reasonably and
mutually acceptable to the Parties, to from time to time inspect and review
such records as the Stockholder Representative may deem necessary or
appropriate to comply with its duties and obligations under this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in all cases, such activities are to be
conducted by the Stockholder Representative during normal business hours and,
in the case of activities conducted by or on behalf of the Stockholder
Representative, at the Stockholder Representatives sole expense and, in the
case of activities conducted by or on behalf of Parent, at Parents sole
expense. Any information obtained under this _Section 6.3(c)_ shall be kept
confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or in the conduct of a Contest or other Tax proceeding.

Section 6.4 Preparation of Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes.

(a) Parent shall prepare (or cause to be prepared), and timely file all Tax
Returns of the Company that are required to be filed with any Governmental
Authority after the Closing Date relating to any taxable periods (or portions
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Taxable Periods_
"). With respect to

 



-47-   any such Tax Returns filed with respect to a Pre-Closing Taxable Period, the
Company Stockholders shall be responsible for the Pre-Closing Taxes due in
respect of such Tax Returns for the Company (" _Pre-Closing Company Returns_
"), to the extent that the aggregate amount of Pre-Closing Taxes due in
respect of all such Tax Returns exceeds the amount of Taxes that are
specifically identified as current liabilities (excluding any reserve for
deferred taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) in the Closing Working Capital, and Parent shall, subject to _Section
6.1(a)_, be responsible for all other Pre-Closing Taxes shown as due on such
Tax Returns. Parent shall notify the Stockholder Representative of any amounts
due from the Company Stockholders in respect of any such Tax Return no later
than ten (10) Business Days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is
due, and the Company Stockholders shall remit such payment to Parent no later
than five (5) Business Days prior to the date such Tax Return is due.

(b) In the case of any Pre-Closing Company Returns, Parent shall prepare (or
cause to be prepared) such Tax Return in a manner consistent with past
practice, except as otherwise required by a change in Law or a good faith
resolution of a contest, and shall deliver any such Tax Return to the
Stockholder Representative for its review at least 30 days prior to the date
such Tax Return is required to be filed. If the Stockholder
Representative disputes any item on such Tax Return, it shall notify Parent
of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for its objection. The Parties
shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute prior to the date on which
the relevant Tax Return is required to be filed. If the Parties cannot
resolve any disputed item, the item in question shall be resolved by the
Dispute Accountants. The fees and expenses of the Dispute Accountants shall be
borne equally by Parent and the Stockholder Representative.

(c) With respect to Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with
respect to the Company for a period that begins before and ends after the
Closing Date (" _Straddle Returns_ "), such Straddle Returns shall be prepared
in a manner consistent with past practice (except as otherwise required by a
change in law or a good faith resolution of a contest), and the Company
Stockholders shall be responsible for the Pre-Closing Taxes due in respect of
such Straddle Returns (as determined under _Section 6.5_) in excess of the
amount of such Taxes which are specifically identified as current liabilities
(excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) in the Closing Working Capital.
Parent shall notify the Stockholder Representative of any amounts due from
the Company Stockholders in respect of any Straddle Return no later than ten
(10) Business Days prior to the date on which such Straddle Return is due, and
the Company Stockholders shall remit such payment to Parent no later than
five (5) Business Days prior to the date such Straddle Return is due. Parent
shall deliver any Straddle Return to the Stockholder Representative for their
review at least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is
required to be filed. If the Stockholder Representative disputes any item on
such Tax Return, it shall notify Parent of such disputed item (or items) and
the basis for its objection. The Parties shall act in good faith to resolve
any such dispute prior to the date on which the relevant Tax Return is
required to be filed. If the Parties cannot resolve any disputed item, the
item in question shall be resolved by the Dispute Accountants. The fees and
expenses of the Dispute Accountants shall be borne equally by Parent and the
Stockholder Representative.

(d) Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall (or shall cause or permit
any of their Subsidiaries to) amend, re-file or otherwise modify any Tax
Return relating in whole or in part to the Company with respect to any Pre-
Closing Taxable Period or Straddle Period (to the 

 



-48-   extent the same could impose any additional Liability on the Company
Stockholders) without the written consent of the Stockholder Representative,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 6.5 Straddle Periods.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes of the Company that
are payable with respect to any Tax period that begins before and ends after
the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of any such Taxes that
constitutes Pre-Closing Taxes shall: (i) in the case of Taxes that are either
(x) based upon or related to income or receipts, or (y) imposed in connection
with any sale, transfer or assignment or any deemed sale, transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), be deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the tax year or period ended on
the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of Taxes (other than those described in
clause (i) above) that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the
business or assets of the Company or otherwise measured by the level of any
item, be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
(or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of
such Taxes for the immediately preceding Tax period) multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. For purposes of clause
(i) of the preceding sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or other item
(including, without limitation, the effect of any graduated rates of tax) that
is calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date on a pro rata basis determined by
multiplying the total amount of such item allocated to the Straddle Period
times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. In the
case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including net worth or
long-term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to be allocated
under this _Section 6.5_ shall be computed by reference to the level of such
items on the Closing Date. The Parties will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, elect with the relevant Governmental Authority to treat
a portion of any Straddle Period as a short taxable period ending as of the
close of business on the Closing Date.

 

Section 6.6 Refunds.

(a) The Company Stockholders shall be entitled to all credits and refunds
(including interest received thereon) in respect of any Pre-Closing Taxable
Period relating to the Company, except, subject to  _Section 6.9_, any
credit or refund (and interest received thereon) attributable to the carryback
of any Tax losses, credits or similar items from a taxable period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date to a Pre-Closing Taxable Period.
All credits and refunds (including interest received thereon) in respect of
any Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between the Company
Stockholders pursuant to the principles set forth in _Section 6.5_.
Parent shall cause each such refund to which the Company Stockholders are
entitled to be paid to the Stockholder Representative for distribution to the
Company Stockholders promptly following its receipt.

 



-49-  (b) Except as provided in _Section 6.6(a)_, Parent shall be entitled to
all credits and refunds (including interest received thereon) in respect of
any Taxes of Parent, the Company and their Subsidiaries.

Section 6.7 Conveyance Taxes.

Parent and the Company shall each pay one half of all sales, use, value
added, transfer, stamp, registration, documentary, excise, real property
transfer or gains, or similar Taxes incurred solely as a result of the
consummation of the Merger, with the Companys portion included in the
Closing Work Capital.

Section 6.8 Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements.

Any and all Tax Sharing Agreements between the Company, on the one hand, and
the Company Stockholders and their Affiliates, on the other hand, shall be
terminated as to the Company as of the Closing Date, and the Company shall not
be obligated to make any payment pursuant to any such Tax Sharing Agreement
for any past or future period.

 

Section 6.9 Carrybacks.

Following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall, to the extent
permissible under applicable Laws, waive the right to carryback any Tax
losses, credits or similar items attributable to such Person from a taxable
period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date to a Pre-Closing
Taxable Period.

notice from any Party to the breaching Party prior to such date shall not
thereafter be barred by the expiration of the period during which to make
Claims based upon the relevant representation or warranty to the extent that
it relates to such Claims; _provided_ , _further_ , that (a) the rights to

Subject to the limitations contained in this _Article IX_ , from and after the
Closing, Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Company
Stockholder and its Representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the
" _Company Stockholder Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against all Losses
based upon or arising from:

 

(a) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Parent
contained in this Agreement or in the certificate delivered by Parent
pursuant to _Section 7.3(c)_, as of the date such representation or warranty
was made or as if such representation or warranty were made on and as of the
Closing Date (except for representations and warranties that expressly relate
to a specified date, the breach of or inaccuracy in which will be determined
with reference to such specified date);

 

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Parent contained in this
Agreement; or

 

(c) enforcing the indemnification provided for in this _Section 9.2_, but
only if a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final,
nonappealable judgment that such Company Stockholder Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification under _Section 9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.2(b)_, as
applicable.

 

Section 9.3 Matters Pertaining to Indemnification by Parent.

 

The indemnification provided for in _Section 9.2_ shall be subject to the
following limitations:

 

(a) Parent shall not be obligated to pay any amounts in respect of
indemnification obligations under _Section 9.2(a)_, except those based upon
or arising from _Section 4.1_ (first and second sentences only), _Section
4.2_ or _Section 4.7_ (the " _Parent Basket Exclusions_ "), until the
aggregate amounts for indemnification in respect of indemnification
obligations under _Section 9.2(a)_, except those based upon or arising from
the Parent Basket Exclusions, equals $1.05 million (the " _Parent Basket
Amount_ "), after which Parent shall be obligated to pay in full all such
amounts for such indemnification in excess of the Parent Basket Amount.

(b) Parent shall be obligated to pay any amounts for indemnification based on
the Parent Basket Exclusions without regard to the individual or aggregate
amounts thereof and without regard to whether all other indemnification
payments shall have exceeded, in the aggregate, the Parent Basket Amount.

(c) The Company Stockholder Indemnified Parties may not assert a Claim
for indemnification under _Section 9.2(a)_ (other than in connection with a
Claim based on the Parent Basket Exclusions, in which case this limitation
shall not apply) unless the amount of Losses resulting directly or indirectly
from such Claim or series of Claims that arise out of the same or a series of
related facts, events or circumstances exceeds $10,000.00, at which point a
Claim can be made for the entire amount of such Losses without regard to the
$10,000.00 threshold (subject to the other limitations in this _Section
9.3_).

 



-55-  (d) The maximum amount of indemnification payments under _Section 9.2(a)_ to
which the Company Stockholder Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
receive (other than indemnification in connection with any of the Parent
Basket Exclusions) shall not exceed in the aggregate $9.8 million.

 

(e) For purposes of determining whether a representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement has been breached or is inaccurate, limitations or
qualifications as to materiality, material adverse effect or similar concept
set forth in such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall be
disregarded, other than those in _Sections 4.1_ and _4.8_.

 

(f) Indemnification of a Company Stockholder Indemnified Party by Parent shall
be limited to the amount of any Loss that remains after deducting therefrom
(and the cumulative amount of all Losses for purposes of determining the
Parent Basket Amount shall be reduced by the amount of) any insurance proceeds
or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually
recovered (net of out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with such
recovery) by a Company Stockholder Indemnified Party from any insurer or other
third party with respect thereto. Each Company Stockholder Indemnified Party
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such proceeds,
benefits and recoveries described in the preceding sentence from its insurers;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no Company Stockholder Indemnified Party shall
be required to initiate litigation or arbitration proceedings to seek
remedies against an insurer, and payments otherwise due under this _Article
IX_ shall not be delayed pending any such attempts at recovery. In the event
that any such proceeds, net of out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection
with their recovery, are received by a Company Stockholder Indemnified Party
with respect to any Losses indemnifiable hereunder after payment of an
indemnity Claim by Parent hereunder with respect thereto, the Company
Stockholder Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to Parent the lesser of (i)
the amount paid by Parent with respect to such Losses and (ii) the amount of
such proceeds or recoveries that are received by a Company Stockholder
Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses.

(g) To the extent that a Company Stockholder Indemnified Party has recovered
all or any portion of its Losses with respect to any matter arising under one
provision of this Agreement, such Company Stockholder Indemnified Party shall
not be entitled to recover such portion of such Losses pursuant to other
provisions of this Agreement.

 

(h) Subject to the rights of the DandO Indemnified Parties under _Section 5.9_,
in no event shall any Company Stockholder Indemnified Party be entitled to be
indemnified for any Losses based upon or arising from any Claim (other than in
respect of Dissenting Shares under Indiana Law) threatened or commenced by a
Company Stockholder in its capacity as a Company Stockholder relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than any such Claim
threatened or commenced to enforce against Parent or the Surviving Corporation
the terms of the Parent Delivered Agreements by any party to such agreement).

(i) In the event that Parent makes any indemnification payment in respect of
Losses hereunder, Parent shall, to the extent of such payment, be subrogated
to all rights of the Company Stockholder Indemnified Parties against any third
party in respect of the Losses to which such payment relates. The Company
Stockholder Indemnified Parties shall execute upon request all instruments,
documents and agreements reasonably required to evidence or further perfect
such right of subrogation.

 



-56-  Section 9.4 Obligation of the Company Stockholders to Indemnify.

Subject to the limitations contained in this _Article IX_ , from and after the
Closing, each Company Stockholder jointly and severally to the extent of the
Escrow Fund and after the Escrow Fund has been exhausted in full, each Company
Stockholder severally in accordance with its Pro-Rata Share (except with
respect to an Individual Representation, for which the applicable Company
Stockholder will be solely liable; _provided_ that the Parent Indemnified
Parties will have access to the full Escrow Fund for any such breach) shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent and its Affiliates (including
Spectrum Brands, Inc. and Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc.) and their respective
directors, officers, control persons (but only to the extent such control
persons have Liability under any federal or state securities Laws),
employees, Representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the "
_Parent Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against all Losses based upon or
arising from:

(a) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of the
Company contained in this Agreement (other than those in _Section 3.15_, any
breach or inaccuracy of which is addressed in _Article VI_ ) or in the
certificate delivered by the Stockholder Representative pursuant to _Section
7.2(d)_ in respect of such representations and warranties, as of the date such
representation or warranty was made or as if such representation or warranty
were made on and as of the Closing Date (after giving effect to any Permitted
Updates, and except for representations and warranties that expressly relate
to a specified date, the breach of or inaccuracy in which will be determined
with reference to such specified date);

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this
Agreement (other than any covenant or agreement contained in _Section
5.1(b)(xvi)_ or _Article VI_ , any breach of which is addressed in _Article
VI_ );

(c) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of a Company
Stockholder, or any breach of any covenant or agreement by a Company
Stockholder, contained herein, in the Transaction Support Agreement or in any
other document delivered to Parent by a Company Stockholder in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby;

(d) any legal fees and expenses incurred by the Company in calendar year 2012
for patent disputes or litigation matters existing at the Effective Time in
excess of $400,000.00;

 

(e) any Claim (other than in respect of Dissenting Shares under Indiana Law)
threatened or commenced by a Company Stockholder in its capacity as a Company
Stockholder relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other
than any such Claim threatened or commenced to enforce against Parent or the
Surviving Corporation the terms of the Parent Delivered Agreements by any
party to such agreement); or

(f) enforcing the indemnification provided for in this _Section 9.4_, but
only if a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final,
nonappealable judgment that such Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under _Section 9.4(a)_, _(b)_ , _(c)_ , _(d)_ or _(e)_ , as
applicable. 

 



-57-  Section 9.5 Matters Pertaining to Indemnification by the Company
Stockholders.

The indemnification provided for in _Section 9.4_ shall be subject to the
following limitations:

(a) The Company Stockholders shall not be obligated to pay any amounts in
respect of indemnification obligations under _Section 9.4(a)_, except those
based upon or arising from _Sections_ _3.1_ , _3.2_ , _3.3_ , or _3.32_ , and
any Individual Representations (the " _Basket Exclusions_ "), until the
aggregate amounts for indemnification in respect of indemnification
obligations under _Section 9.4(a)_, except those based upon or arising from
the Basket Exclusions, equals $1.05 million (the " _Basket Amount_ "), after
which the Company Stockholders shall be obligated to pay in full all such
amounts for such indemnification in excess of the Basket Amount.

(b) The Company Stockholders shall be obligated to pay any amounts for
indemnification based on the Basket Exclusions without regard to the
individual or aggregate amounts thereof and without regard to whether all
other indemnification payments shall have exceeded, in the aggregate, the
Basket Amount, and with respect to its Individual Representations, each
Company Stockholder will indemnify Parent for amounts based on such
Company Stockholders Individual Representations.

(c) The Parent Indemnified Parties may not assert a Claim for
indemnification under _Section 9.4(a)_ (other than in connection with a
Claim based on the Basket Exclusions, in which case this limitation shall not
apply) unless the amount of Losses resulting directly or indirectly from such
Claim or series of Claims that arise out of the same or a series of related
facts, events or circumstances exceeds $10,000, at which point a Claim can be
made for the entire amount of such Losses without regard to the $10,000
threshold (subject to the other limitations in this _Section 9.5_). For the
avoidance of doubt, with respect to any Claims made for a breach or inaccuracy
of _Section 3.13(c)_ with respect to Persons infringing Company Intellectual
Property Rights, acts of unrelated Persons shall not be aggregated for
purposes of applying the limits of this _Section 9.5(c)_.

(d) The maximum amount of indemnification payments under _Section 9.4(a)_ to
which the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to receive shall not
exceed in the aggregate nine million eight hundred thousand dollars
($9,800,000.00); _provided_ , that the foregoing limitation shall not apply
in connection with the Basket Exclusions.

(e) Each Company Stockholder shall solely be liable in connection with an
indemnification Claim under _Section 9.4(c)_ (and _Section 9.4(f)_ to the
extent related thereto) and no other Company Stockholder shall have any
liability with respect to such Claims against another Company Stockholder.

(f) Subject to _Sections 9.5(d)_ and _9.5(h)_ and without limiting the ability
of the Parent Indemnified Parties to recover Losses from the Escrow Fund, no
Company Stockholder will be liable for any Claim of indemnification under this
Agreement (whether pursuant to _Article VI_ or this _Article IX_ ) or any
Company Delivered Agreement for more than its Pro-Rata Share of the Losses in
connection with such Claim.

(g) Without limiting the ability of the Parent Indemnified Parties to recover
Losses from the Escrow Fund, no Company Stockholder will be liable for
aggregate Claims of indemnification under this Agreement (whether pursuant to
_Article VI_ or this _Article IX_ ), the Transaction Support Agreement or any
Company Delivered Agreement in an amount in excess of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration received by such Company Stockholder.

 



-58-  (h) In seeking indemnification hereunder, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall
first exercise their remedies with respect to the Escrow Fund pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement and, if the Escrow Fund has been exhausted in full, with
respect to the Company Stockholders directly pursuant to this Agreement. In
the event that any Parent Indemnified Party recovers an amount from the
Escrow Fund for an Individual Representation Claim, the Company Stockholder
liable for such Individual Representation Claim shall promptly pay an amount
to the Escrow Agent equal to the amount so recovered by the Parent
Indemnified Party.

(i) For purposes of determining whether a representation or warranty has
been breached or is inaccurate, limitations or qualifications as to
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar concept set forth in such
representation or warranty shall be disregarded, other than those in _Sections
3.6_ , _3.7(a)_ ,  _3.9_ , _3.21_ , _3.22_ , _3.29_ , _3.30_ and _3.32_.

(j) Indemnification of a Parent Indemnified Party by the Company Stockholders
shall be limited to the amount of any Loss that remains after deducting
therefrom (and the cumulative amount of all Losses for purposes of determining
the Basket Amount shall be reduced by the amount of) any insurance proceeds
or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually recovered
(net of out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with such recovery) by a
Parent Indemnified Party from any insurer or other third party with
respect thereto. Each Parent Indemnified Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all such proceeds, benefits and recoveries
described in the preceding sentence from insurance carriers; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no Parent Indemnified Party shall be required to initiate
litigation or arbitration proceedings to seek remedies against an insurance
carrier, and payments otherwise due under this _Article IX_ shall not be
delayed pending any such attempts at recovery. In the event that any such
proceeds, net of out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with recovering
them, are received by a Parent Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses
indemnifiable hereunder after payment of an indemnity Claim by a Company
Stockholder hereunder with respect thereto, the Parent Indemnified Party shall
promptly pay to the Company Stockholder the lesser of (i) the amount paid by
such Company Stockholder with respect to such Losses and (ii) the amount
of such proceeds or recoveries that are received by a Parent Indemnified
Party with respect to such Losses.

(k) To the extent that a Parent Indemnified Party has recovered all or any
portion of its Losses with respect to any matter arising under one provision
of this Agreement, such Parent Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to
recover such portion of such Losses pursuant to other provisions of this
Agreement.

(l) In the event that a Company Stockholder makes any indemnification
payment in respect of Losses hereunder, such Company Stockholder shall, to
the extent of such payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Parent
Indemnified Parties against any third party in respect of the Losses to which
such payment relates;  _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Company Stockholder shall exercise any such subrogation rights
against any then-current customer or then-current supplier of the Company. The
Parent Indemnified Parties shall execute upon request all instruments,
documents and agreements reasonably required to evidence or further perfect
such right of subrogation.

 



-59-  Section 9.6 Procedure for Indemnification.

 

The Party making a Claim under this _Article IX_ is referred to as the "
_Indemnified Party_ " and the party against whom such Claims are asserted
under this _Article IX_ is referred to as the " _Indemnifying Party_." If the
Indemnifying Party is a Company Stockholder, (i) the Stockholder
Representative shall exercise, in accordance with _Section 11.13_, all
rights of such Company Stockholder as an Indemnifying Party under this
_Section 9.6_, and (ii) for procedural purposes only all references to the
Indemnifying Party in this  _Section 9.6_ shall be deemed to refer to the
Stockholder Representative (except with respect to Individual Representations,
which each Company Stockholder shall be required to resolve individually). All
Claims by any Indemnified Party under this _Article IX_ shall be asserted and
resolved as follows:

(a) _Notice of Asserted Liability_. Promptly after receipt by the Indemnified
Party of notice of, or the Indemnifying Party becoming aware of, the
commencement of any action or proceeding, the assertion of any Claim by a
third party, the imposition of any penalty or assessment or a Claim not
involving a third party for which the Indemnified Party seeks to be
indemnified that may result in a Loss (each, an " _Asserted Liability_ "), the
Indemnified Party shall give written notice of such Asserted Liability (the "
_Claims Notice_ ") to the Indemnifying Party. The failure to give such prompt
written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure
or actually incurs an incremental out-of-pocket expense by reason of such
failure. The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable
detail, including (i) the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
that is alleged to have been inaccurate or to have been breached, (ii) the
basis for such allegation, including the provision of supporting documentation
and (iii) if known, the aggregate amount of the Losses for which a Claim is
being made under this _Article IX_ or, to the extent that such Losses are not
known or have not been incurred at the time such Claim is made, an estimate,
to be prepared in good faith and accompanied by supporting documentation, of
the aggregate potential amount of such Losses.

(b) _Non-Third Party Claims_. If the Claims Notice from the Indemnified Party
pertains to an Asserted Liability other than a claim or demand from a third
party, then the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days following receipt of the
Claims Notice to make such investigation at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party of the Asserted Liability as the Indemnifying Party deems necessary or
desirable. For the purposes of such investigation, the Indemnified Party
agrees to make available to the Indemnifying Party the information relied
upon by the Indemnified Party to substantiate the Asserted Liability and such
other information in its possession that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request for purposes of such investigation; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the Indemnified Party shall not be required to provide to or share with the
Indemnifying Party any materials that are protected by the attorney-client
privilege. If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party agree at
or prior to the expiration of said 30 day period (or any mutually agreed upon
extension thereof) on the validity and amount of such Asserted Liability, the
Indemnifying Party shall promptly pay to the Indemnified Party the agreed-to
amount of the Claim by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by the Indemnified Party, or, to the extent that all or any
portion of the indemnification payment is to be paid out of the Escrow Fund,
Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall give the Escrow Agent a joint
written instruction for payment of such funds

 



-60-   in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. If the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party do not agree prior to the expiration of such 30-day period
(as such period may be extended by mutual agreement) on the validity and
amount of such Asserted Liability, then each of the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party may pursue the remedies available under this Agreement.

 

(c) _Opportunity to Defend Third Party Claims_.

(i) If the Claims Notice pertains to an Asserted Liability that relates to a
claim or demand from a third party, the Indemnifying Party may elect to settle
or defend, at its own expense and by its own counsel, such Asserted
Liability; _provided_ , that if the Indemnifying Party is a Company
Stockholder, such Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend or
direct the defense of any such Asserted Liability that is asserted directly
or indirectly by or on behalf of a Person that is a current or prospective
customer or supplier of Parent or its Affiliates if in the reasonable judgment
of the Indemnified Party (which may be asserted at any time) the Indemnifying
Partys defense of such Asserted Liability could reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the Indemnified Partys existing or
prospective relationship with such current or prospective customer or
supplier.

 

(ii) If the Indemnifying Party elects to settle or defend such Asserted
Liability, it shall promptly notify the Indemnified Party and any other
Indemnifying Parties in writing of its intent to do so, and the Indemnified
Party, at the expense of the applicable Indemnifying Party or Indemnifying
Parties, shall cooperate in the compromise of, or defense against, such
Asserted Liability.

(iii) If the Indemnifying Party elects not to settle or defend such Asserted
Liability, fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its
election as provided in this Agreement, or otherwise abandons the defense of
such Asserted Liability, the Indemnified Party may pay, compromise or defend
such Asserted Liability and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based
upon, arising from or relating to such Asserted Liability. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall
settle or compromise any Asserted Liability without the prior written consent
of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); _provided_ that, and Indemnifying Party may elect to compromise or
settle any Asserted Liability for which it has elected to defend, without
the Indemnified Partys consent so long as (A) there is no finding or
admission of any violation of Law or other wrongdoing by or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party, (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are
paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, and (C) such compromise or settlement
includes a full and complete release of the Indemnified Parties from all
Losses with respect to such Asserted Liability.

 

(iv) The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense
of any Asserted Liability with counsel selected by it and reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party subject to the Indemnifying Partys
right to control the defense. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall
be at the expense of the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that if in
the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (A) there are
legal defenses available to an Indemnified Party that are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party or (B) there exists a
conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
that cannot be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the

 



-61-   reasonable legal fees and expenses of one separate counsel to all of the
applicable Indemnified Parties (in addition to one local counsel in each
jurisdiction that may be necessary or appropriate; _provided_ , that the
Indemnified Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent
the Indemnified Parties reasonably believe it appropriate to do so, to
minimize the need for local counsel). If the Indemnifying Party chooses to
defend any Asserted Liability, the Indemnified Party shall make available to
the Indemnifying Party any personnel, books, records or other documents within
its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense.

 

(v) The rights of the Company Stockholders under this _Section 9.6(c)_ with
respect to any Asserted Liability for which all of the Company Stockholders
are Indemnifying Parties may be exercised solely by the Stockholder
Representative and, if the Stockholder Representative elects to defend such
Asserted Liability, the Stockholder Representative shall have sole and
exclusive control over such defense as between the Company Stockholders.

(vi) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of
this _Section 9.6(c)_ shall not apply to any Asserted Liability from a
Governmental Authority for Taxes.

Section 9.7 Sole and Exclusive Remedy.

Except as otherwise provided in _Section 10.2_, from and after the Closing,
the remedies provided in _Article VI_ and this _Article IX_ and the Escrow
Agreement shall be the sole recourse of all Parties for all Losses based
upon, arising from or relating to any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, the Transaction Support
Agreement, the Letters of Transmittal or in any certificate delivered pursuant
to  _Section 7.2(d)_ or _Section 7.3(c)_. Nothing in this _Section 9.7
_shall limit any Persons right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to
which any Person shall be entitled or to seek any remedy on account of any
Persons fraud or willful or deliberate misrepresentations or breaches.

 

Section 9.8 Miscellaneous.

It is the intention of the Parties to treat any indemnity payment made under
this Agreement with respect to the Merger as an adjustment to the Aggregate
Merger Consideration for all federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes
and the Parties shall file their Tax Returns accordingly, except as otherwise
required by a change in Law or a good faith resolution of a contest. IN NO
EVENT SHALL LOSSES INCLUDE, OR SHALL AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY BE ENTITLED TO
RECOVER FROM ANY INDEMNIFYING PARTY, ANY AMOUNTS IN RESPECT OF TREBLE,
EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL (TO THE EXTENT DAMAGES WERE NOT REASONABLY
FORESEEABLE) OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, IN EACH CASE EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PAYABLE TO
A THIRD PARTY.

executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original,
and each of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. Any Party may
deliver an executed copy of this Agreement and of any documents contemplated
hereby by facsimile transmission or electronic mail to another Party and such

Section 11.9 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction.

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws
of the State of Ohio without giving effect to any Laws of such state that
would make such choice of Laws ineffective, except to the extent that
provisions of the Indiana Business Corporation Law are mandatorily applicable.
Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this
Agreement or the transactions 

 



-67-   contemplated hereby and obligations arising hereunder brought by another
Party or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined
exclusively in the state or federal courts located in the State of Ohio and
any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Ohio. Each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or
proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the aforesaid courts.
Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by
way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, (a) any Claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in
accordance with this _Section 11.9_, (b) any Claim that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any Claim that (i) the action or proceeding in such court is
brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Claim is improper or
(iii) this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parent may institute a legal action or proceeding against one or more
of the Company Stockholders for indemnification under _Article VI_ or _Article
IX_ without instituting an action or proceeding against all of the Company
Stockholders.

 

Section 11.10 Waiver of Jury Trial.

 

EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN

-68-  Section 11.13 Stockholder Representative.

 

(a) Effective as of the date hereof each Company Stockholder, by such Company
Stockholders execution and delivery of the Transaction Support Agreement or
an agreement to be bound thereby, hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints,
and effective as of the Effective Time, each other Company Stockholder, by

in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) above, including the taking of any
action and the execution and delivery of any agreement or instrument by or on

necessary or reasonably required to accomplish the purposes of the foregoing.
The appointment set forth in this  _Section 11.13_ shall be coupled with an
interest.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Stockholder
Representative shall have the right and power to do or cause to be done any of
the following things on behalf of each of the Company Stockholders and all of
them collectively:

 

(i) act as the sole representative of the Company Stockholders and exercise
all rights of the Company Stockholders under the Company Delivered
Agreements, including the prosecution, defense and settlement of all claims
and actions under, and to resolve all matters relating to, indemnification
hereunder or thereunder or any related agreement except with respect to

indemnification individually;

(ii) (A) authorize delivery to any Parent Indemnified Party of all or a
portion of the Escrow Fund in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, (B)
receive any payments made to the Company Stockholders or to the Stockholder

manner as the Stockholder Representative in its sole discretion deems

the Stockholder Representative under the Company Delivered Agreements; and

 



-69-  (iii) otherwise take all actions and do all things reasonably required
or advisable to accomplish any of the matters referred to in the Company
Delivered Agreements, including the execution and delivery of any documents
and instruments, and generally to act for and in the name of the Company
Stockholders as fully as each Company Stockholder could if then personally
present and acting. The Stockholder Representative is hereby empowered to
determine, in accordance with the terms of the Company Delivered Agreements,
the time or times when, the purposes for which, and the manner in which, the
power herein conferred upon the Stockholder Representative shall be exercised.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Stockholder Representative shall have no authority to act as attorney-in-fact
or otherwise for any Company Stockholder with respect to any Individual
Representations, and each such Company Stockholder shall be entitled to
resolve any and all such claims.

(d) The Stockholder Representative shall have no duties except those which
are expressly set forth herein.

(e) The Parent Indemnified Parties and all other persons dealing with the
Stockholder Representative may rely and act upon any writing believed in good
faith to be signed by the Stockholder Representative or an authorized
representative of the Stockholder Representative, and may assume that all
actions of the Stockholder Representative and any authorized Representative
of the Stockholder Representative have been duly authorized by the Company
Stockholders. The actions, decisions and instructions of the Stockholder
Representative taken, made or given pursuant to the authority granted to the
Stockholder Representative pursuant to this _Section 11.13_ shall be
conclusive and binding upon each Company Stockholder and each Company
Stockholders heirs, Representatives, successors and assigns, as applicable,
and such Persons shall not have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same.

(f) The power of attorney granted to the Stockholder Representative, and all
authority hereby conferred upon it is irrevocable and will not be terminated
by any act of any Company Stockholder or by operation of Law, whether by the
death or incapacity of any Company Stockholder or by the occurrence of any
other event.

(g) The Stockholder Representative shall promptly deliver to an applicable
Company Stockholder (at the address of such Company Stockholder set forth in
the Transaction Support Agreement or as otherwise communicated by such Company
Stockholder to the Stockholder Representative) copies of all statements,
notices, letters of direction or other communications given or received by it
in its capacity as the Stockholder Representative under any Company Delivered
Agreements in connection with an Individual Representation.

 

(h) The Stockholder Representative may execute any of its duties under any
Company Delivered Agreements by or through agents and shall be entitled to
rely upon the advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to the
Stockholder Representatives duties, as the case may be, hereunder and
thereunder. The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to 

 



-70-   rely on any notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, statement or
other document believed by the Stockholder Representative to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed and sent by the proper Person or Persons and,
in respect to legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the
Stockholder Representative. The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable
to the Company Stockholders for any error of judgment or for any act done or
step taken or omitted by it in good faith, or for any mistake of fact or Law
except as otherwise set forth in _Section 11.13(l)_.

(i) The Stockholder Representative shall promptly distribute all amounts it
receives on behalf of the Company Stockholders under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement, net of any Stockholder Representative Reserve, to the
Company Stockholders (other than any Dissenting Stockholder) in proportion to
their respective Pro-Rata Shares (unless otherwise specified herein); except
with respect to any Company Stockholder that has not surrendered its Company
Certificates or Warrants in accordance with _Section 2.8(c)_, the Stockholder
Representative shall promptly distribute such Company Stockholders Pro-Rata
Share of any such amounts distributed to the Company Stockholders (other than
the Dissenting Stockholders) to the Exchange Agent, or if the Exchange Agent
has distributed the Exchange Fund to the Surviving Corporation in accordance
with _Section 2.8(e)_, then to the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein contained, to the extent necessary to account
for breaches by a Company Stockholder as to its Individual Representations,
the Stockholder Representative may distribute any amounts it receives
hereunder (whether or not a part of the Stockholder Representative Reserve)
among the Company Stockholders in a proportion reasonably determined by it to
reflect the economic intent of this Agreement with respect to the allocation
of the Aggregate Merger Consideration and the intended proportional
liabilities of the Company Stockholders under this Agreement (including with
respect to Individual Representations).

(j) Prior to making any distribution of any amount to the Company
Stockholders, the Stockholder Representative may set aside and reserve
therefrom an amount that it deems advisable to satisfy any future obligations
that may be owed by the Company Stockholders under this Agreement or otherwise
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(other than obligations arising with respect to an Individual Representation),
or to satisfy any future costs, expenses, Liabilities, Taxes or other amounts
that the Stockholder Representative may incur in connection with acting in
such capacity under this Agreement (all such amounts so set aside and
reserved, the " _Stockholder Representative Reserve_ "). The Stockholder
Representative may hold, invest, reinvest and/or deposit the Stockholder
Representative Reserve in (i) direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed
by, the United States of America, (ii) certificates of deposit, checking,
savings or money market accounts of any bank or trust company organized under
the laws of the United States of America, or any state, or (iii) such other
accounts or investments as it reasonably determines (including non-interest
bearing accounts). The Stockholder Representative may (but shall have no
obligation to) use all or any portion of the Stockholder Representative
Reserve to satisfy any and all costs, expenses, liabilities, taxes or other
amounts that the Stockholder Representative may incur in connection with
acting in such capacity under this Agreement and to satisfy any future
obligations of the Company Stockholders under this Agreement or otherwise in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(other than with respect to Individual Representations). Promptly following
the date on which the Stockholder Representative reasonably determines that 

 



-71-   all liabilities and obligations of the Company Stockholders hereunder (other
than in connection with Individual Representations) and all costs, expenses,
liabilities, taxes or other amounts that the Stockholder Representative may
incur in connection with acting in such capacity under this Agreement have
been satisfied, the Stockholder Representative or Exchange Agent, as the case
may be, shall disburse any remaining portion of the Stockholder
Representative Reserve to the Company Stockholders (other than any Dissenting
Stockholder) in proportion to their respective Pro-Rata Shares; except with
respect to any Company Stockholder that has not surrendered its
Company Certificates or Warrants in accordance with _Section 2.8(c)_, the
Stockholder Representative shall promptly distribute such Company
Stockholders Pro-Rata Share of any such amounts distributed to the Company
Stockholders (other than the Dissenting Stockholders) to the Exchange Agent,
or if the Exchange Agent has distributed the Exchange Fund to the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with _Section 2.8(e)_, then to the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(k) Each Company Stockholder will be required to indemnify, defend and hold
the Stockholder Representative harmless from and against its Pro-Rata Share
of any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and costs) which the Stockholder Representative may
suffer or sustain as a result of any action taken, or not taken, in
good faith hereunder, except as otherwise set forth in _Section 11.13(l)_.
In the event the Stockholder Representative Reserve does not contain
sufficient amounts to satisfy and pay in full all expenses and obligations of
the Stockholder Representative likely to be incurred by the Stockholder
Representative in fulfilling its obligations hereunder, the Stockholder
Representative shall not be obligated to take any action contemplated hereby
until the Company Stockholders shall have paid to the Stockholder
Representative sufficient amounts to pay in full all such expenses and
obligations (which payment shall be made by the Company Stockholders in
accordance with their respective Pro-Rata Shares).

 

(l) The Stockholder Representative is acting solely in an agency capacity and
will have no personal liability to the Company Stockholders or their
respective Representatives for any action taken, or inaction, in its capacity
of the Stockholder Representative, except for the Stockholder Representatives
or its Representatives willful misconduct or fraud. WITHOUT LIMITING
THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE STOCKHOLDER
REPRESENTATIVE BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY SPECIAL, SPECULATIVE, REMOTE,
EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, TREBLE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

 

(m) If the Stockholder Representative should become unable to fulfill his
responsibilities as the Stockholder Representative or shall resign, then the
Company Stockholders, by a majority vote based on their respective Pro-Rata
Shares, shall promptly appoint a successor Stockholder Representative and
shall promptly notify Parent of such successor. The authorizations of
the Stockholder Representative will be effective until its rights and
obligations under the Company Delivered Agreements terminate by virtue of the
termination of any and all obligations of the Company Stockholders to the
Parent Indemnified Parties under the Company Delivered Agreements. Promptly
following appointment of a successor Stockholder Representative, the former
Stockholder Representative shall distribute the Stockholder Representative
Reserve to the successor Stockholder Representative, less all costs, fees and
expenses which it reasonably believes it may be obligated to pay thereafter in
connection this Agreement. If within thirty (30) days after the effective date
of the resignation of the former Stockholder Representative as the
Stockholder Representative hereunder a successor

 



-72-   has not been appointed as provided above, the former Stockholder
Representative may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Stockholder Representative and the costs, expenses
and attorneys fees which are incurred in connection with such a proceeding
shall be paid from the Stockholder Representative Reserve (with any excess
paid by the Company Stockholders in accordance with their respective Pro-Rata
Shares). Upon delivery of the Stockholder Representative Reserve as provided
above, the former Stockholder Representative shall be discharged of all
further obligations hereunder.
