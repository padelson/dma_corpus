Article III

 



 

EFFECT OF THE MERGERS

 



 

Section 3.1 _Effect of the Acquisition Merger_.

 



 

(a) At the Acquisition Effective Time, by virtue of the Acquisition Merger and
without any action on the part of any of the Parties or the holder of any
securities of the Parties:

 



 

(i) each Glimcher Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Acquisition Effective Time that is held directly by Glimcher, WPG LP or Merger
Sub I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto;

 



 

(ii) each Glimcher Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Acquisition Effective Time (other than Glimcher Common Shares cancelled
pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(i)_ and Glimcher Restricted Shares that are
Glimcher Continuing Equity Awards) shall be converted into the right to
receive (A) an amount in cash equal to $10.40 and (B) 0.1989 of a newly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.0001
per share, of WPG (" _WPG Common Stock_ ") ((A) and (B) together, the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), in each case without interest; and

 



       
 

 



 

(iii) each limited liability company interest of WPG Merger Sub I issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Acquisition Effective Time shall remain
outstanding and be unaffected by the Acquisition Merger.

 



 

(b) All Glimcher Common Shares to be converted pursuant to _Section
3.1(a)(ii)_, when so converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(ii)_, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ")
or book-entry share or interest registered in the transfer books of Glimcher
(a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") that immediately prior to the Acquisition Effective
Time evidenced Glimcher Common Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Glimcher Common Shares other than the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.7_, including the right,
if any, to receive, pursuant to _Section 3.16_, cash in lieu of fractional
shares of WPG Common Stock into which such Glimcher Common Shares have been
converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(ii)_, together with the amounts, if
any, payable pursuant to _Section 3.9_.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time
during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Acquisition
Effective Time, Glimcher should split, combine or otherwise reclassify the
Glimcher Common Shares, or make a dividend or other distribution in Glimcher
Common Shares (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into Glimcher Common Shares), or engage in a reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or exchange or other like change, then
(without limiting any other rights of the WPG Parties hereunder), the Merger
Consideration shall be ratably adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any
such change. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at
any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Acquisition Effective Time, WPG should split, combine or otherwise reclassify
the shares of WPG Common Stock, or make a dividend or other distribution in
shares of WPG Common Stock (including any dividend or other distribution of
securities convertible into WPG Common Stock), or engage in a
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or exchange or other like
change, then the Merger Consideration shall be ratably adjusted to reflect
fully the effect of any such change.

 



 

(d) If WPG declares a WPG Special Distribution between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, then the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration referenced in _Section 3.1(a)(ii)(A)_ shall be increased by an
amount (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) the
per share amount of the WPG Special Distribution and (ii) 0.7431. If Glimcher
declares a Glimcher Special Distribution between the date of this Agreement
and the Closing Date, then the cash portion of the Merger Consideration
referenced in _Section 3.1(a)(ii)(A)_ shall be decreased by an amount equal
to the per share amount of the Glimcher Special Distribution.

and shall be paid to WPG LP or another entity, as WPG LP directs. No

from making the payments required by this _Article III_, and following any
losses from any such investment, WPG LP shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Exchange Agent to the extent necessary to satisfy WPG LPs
obligations hereunder for the benefit of the holders of Glimcher Common Shares
as of immediately prior to the Acquisition Effective Time, which additional
funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund.

 



 

(c) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Glimcher Common Shares that are
not registered in the transfer records of Glimcher, it shall be a condition of
payment that any Certificate surrendered in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this _Section 3.6_ shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise
in proper form for transfer, or any Book-Entry Share shall be properly
transferred, and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
Transfer Taxes and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger

of WPG that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date and in any event
not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the Closing Date, the
Exchange Agent shall

Effective Time or (ii) Glimcher LP Units or Glimcher Preferred Units
immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, a form of letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk

surrender of the Certificates in exchange for (A) the Merger Consideration, in
the case of Certificates formerly evidencing Glimcher Common Shares, (B) the
Preferred Share Merger Consideration, in the case of Certificates formerly
evidencing Glimcher Preferred Shares, (C) Partnership Merger Consideration, in
the case of Certificates formerly evidencing Glimcher LP Units and (D)

formerly evidencing Glimcher Preferred Units, in such form as Glimcher and WPG

cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, Preferred Share Merger

prior to the Acquisition Effective Time or (ii) Glimcher LP Units or Glimcher
Preferred Units immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time,
shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive the Merger Consideration,
Preferred Share Merger Consideration, Partnership Merger Consideration or
Preferred Unit Partnership Merger Consideration, as applicable, that such

WPG shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as
practicable after the Acquisition Effective Time, the Merger Consideration,

theretofore received any Merger Consideration (including any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any applicable dividends or other distributions with
respect to WPG Common Stock), Preferred Share Merger Consideration,

Consideration to which they are entitled under this _Article III_ shall

holder of Glimcher Common Shares in respect of any cash that would have
otherwise been payable in respect of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share from
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
holders of any such shares immediately prior to the time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Entity, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders
or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled
thereto.

 



 

Section 3.12 _Glimcher Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) Each Glimcher Vesting Equity Award that is a Glimcher Restricted Share
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Acquisition Effective Time shall,
effective immediately prior to the Acquisition Effective Time, by virtue of
the occurrence of the Closing and without any action on the part of any holder
of any such Glimcher Restricted Share, vest in full, and the restrictions and
forfeiture conditions with respect thereto shall lapse and expire, and the
holder of such Glimcher Restricted Share shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration in respect thereof in accordance with _Section 3.1_ of
this Agreement, plus any accrued but unpaid dividends (if any) and less the
Equity Award Withholding Amount; _provided_ that the Equity Award Withholding
Amount shall be withheld first from the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration.

 



 

(b) Each Glimcher Continuing Equity Award that is a Glimcher Restricted Share
award and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Acquisition Effective
Time shall,

 



      
 

 



 

by virtue of the occurrence of the Closing and without any action on the part
of any holder of any such Glimcher Restricted Share, be converted, at the
Acquisition Effective Time, into an award of a number of shares of WPG Common
Stock (a " _WPG Converted Restricted Share Award_ ") equal to the product of
the number of Glimcher Restricted Shares subject to such award and the Equity
Award Exchange Ratio (and rounded, as applicable, to the nearest whole share,
with 0.50 being rounded upward). Each WPG Converted Restricted Share Award
shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the
Glimcher Restricted Share award under the applicable Glimcher Equity Plan and
the agreements evidencing grants thereunder, including as to vesting (as may
be modified by an applicable Continuing Award Waiver). All dividends, if any,
accrued but unpaid as of the Acquisition Effective Time with respect to any
such Glimcher Restricted Share award, shall remain accrued with respect to
associated WPG Converted Restricted Share Award and be treated in accordance
with the terms and conditions of such WPG Converted Restricted Share Award.

 



 

(c) Each Glimcher Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Acquisition Effective Time shall, effective immediately prior to the
Acquisition Effective Time, by virtue of the occurrence of the Closing and
without any action on the part of any holder of any such Glimcher Stock
Option, (A) only if such Glimcher Stock Option is a Glimcher Vesting Equity
Award, vest in full and (B) whether such Glimcher Stock Option is a Glimcher
Vesting Equity Award or a Glimcher Continuing Equity Award, be converted, at
the Acquisition Effective Time, into an option to purchase a number of shares
of WPG Common Stock (each, a " _WPG Converted Option_ ") equal to the product
of (x) the total number of shares of Glimcher Common Shares subject to such
Glimcher Stock Option immediately prior to the Acquisition Effective Time and
(y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down
to the next lower whole number of shares. Each WPG Converted Option shall have
an exercise price per share of WPG Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to (i) the per share exercise price for the shares of
Glimcher Common Shares subject to such Glimcher Stock Option divided by (ii)
the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Except as set forth in this _Section
3.12(c)_, each WPG Converted Option shall otherwise be subject to the same
terms and conditions applicable to the converted Glimcher Stock Option under
the applicable Glimcher Equity Plan and the agreements evidencing grants
thereunder, including, only if such Glimcher Stock Option is a Glimcher
Continuing Equity Award, as to vesting (as may be modified by an applicable
Continuing Award Waiver). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing, in all cases, the exercise price of, and the number of shares
subject to, each WPG Converted Option shall be determined as necessary to
avoid the imposition of taxes and/or penalties under Section 409A of the Code,
and for any Glimcher Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by
reason of its qualification under any of Sections 422 through 424 of the Code,
the exercise price, the number of shares of WPG Common Stock subject to such
Glimcher Stock Option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such
Glimcher Stock Option shall be determined in order to comply with Section 424
of the Code.

 



 

(d) Each Glimcher Performance Share that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Acquisition Effective Time shall, effective immediately prior to the
Acquisition Effective Time, by virtue of the occurrence of the Closing and
without any action on the part of any holder of any such Glimcher Performance
Share, vest if and to the extent the Glimcher Board (or appropriate committee
thereof) determines as of immediately prior to the Acquisition Effective Time
that the performance goals applicable to such Glimcher Performance Share have
been

 



      
 

 



 

achieved based on actual performance measured as of the Acquisition Effective
Time (and the portion that does not so vest will be forfeited immediately
prior to the Acquisition Effective Time without payment of any consideration
therefor). The holder of each Glimcher Performance Share that vests in
accordance with this _Section 3.12(d)_, shall be entitled to receive an
amount equal to the Merger Consideration, less the Equity Award Withholding
Amount, in respect of such Glimcher Performance Share; _provided_ that the
Equity Award Withholding Amount shall be withheld first from the cash portion
of the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(e) For purposes of this _Section 3.12_, " _Equity Award Exchange Ratio_ "
shall mean the sum of (x) the stock portion of the Merger Consideration and
(y) the quotient of (A) the cash portion of the Merger Consideration divided
by (B) the volume-weighted average closing price of WPG Common Stock on the
NYSE on the last ten (10) trading days immediately preceding to the Closing
Date (the " _WPG Closing Price_ ").

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to the
Acquisition Effective Time, Glimcher shall take all actions necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this _Section 3.12_.

 



 

(g) Before the Acquisition Effective Time, WPG shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of WPG Common
Stock for delivery upon exercise of the WPG Converted Options. On the Closing
Date, WPG shall register the shares of WPG Common Stock subject to WPG
Converted Options by filing an effective registration statement on Form S-8
(or any successor form) or another appropriate form, and WPG shall maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements
with respect thereto for so long as such awards remain outstanding. WPG shall
take all action reasonably required to be taken under any applicable state
securities Laws in connection with the issuance of shares of WPG Common Stock
subject to WPG Converted Options.

 



 

(h) Glimcher shall take such action as is necessary to provide that as of no
later than three business days prior to the Closing Date, no Glimcher Common
Shares will be purchased under the Glimcher DRIP; provided, that such
cessation of purchases following the Closing Date shall be conditioned upon
the consummation of the Mergers.

 



 

Section 3.13 _Withholding Rights_. Each Party (including the Surviving Entity
and the Surviving Partnership) and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration, the Preferred Share Merger
Consideration, the Partnership Merger Consideration, the Preferred Unit
Partnership Merger Consideration and any other amounts or property otherwise
payable or distributable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts
or property (or portions thereof) as such Party or the Exchange Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment or
distribution under the Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any other provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 3.14 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable and customary amount as the Surviving Entity may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, Preferred Share Merger
Consideration, Partnership Merger Consideration or Preferred Unit Partnership
Merger Consideration, as applicable, to which the holder thereof is entitled
pursuant to this _Article III_.

 



 

Section 3.15 _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall
be available with respect to the Acquisition Merger, Partnership Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.16 _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of WPG Common Stock
shall be issued in the Merger upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
or with respect to Book-Entry Shares or otherwise, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of WPG. Each holder of Glimcher Common Shares converted
pursuant to the Acquisition Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of WPG Common Stock (after aggregating all shares evidenced
by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall
receive from the Exchange Agent, in lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, a
cash payment (without interest) in an amount representing such holders
proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent
on behalf of all such holders of WPG Common Stock that would otherwise be
issued.

 



 

Section 3.17 _Certain Governance Matters_.

 



 

(a) WPG shall take all requisite action to cause the WPG Board immediately
after the Acquisition Merger to consist of nine (9) members, including (i) the

SEC Filing, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, (i) as of its date, or,

make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, no
Glimcher Subsidiary is separately subject to the periodic reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act.

regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including
that: (1) transactions are executed only in accordance with managements
authorization and (2) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of the financial statements of Glimcher and Glimcher Subsidiaries
and to maintain accountability for the assets of Glimcher and Glimcher
Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2012, Glimcher has disclosed to Glimchers
auditors and the audit committee of the Glimcher Board (i) all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect Glimchers ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data, and (ii) any fraud,

 



      
 

 



 

whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Glimchers internal controls, and Glimcher has made

foregoing. The disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by Glimcher are
reasonably designed to ensure that material information required to be
disclosed by Glimcher in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of Glimcher to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
and to enable Glimchers principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer to make the certifications required under the Exchange Act
with respect to such reports.

or as and to the extent disclosed or reserved against on Glimchers most
recent balance sheet (or in the notes thereto) included in the Glimcher SEC
Filings, none of Glimcher or its consolidated subsidiaries has any liabilities
or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise) required by GAAP to be reflected or reserved against in a
consolidated balance sheet (or in the notes thereto), except for liabilities
or obligations (i) incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice since the most recent balance sheet set forth in the Glimcher
SEC Filings, (ii) that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Glimcher Material Adverse Effect or
(iii) incurred in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereunder.

Subsidiaries.

Section 5.5 _Permits; Compliance with Law_.

 



 

(a) WPG, WPG LP and each other WPG Subsidiary is in possession of all
authorizations, licenses, permits, certificates, approvals, variances,
exemptions, orders, franchises, certifications and clearances of any
Governmental Authority necessary for the WPG Entities to own, lease and, to
the extent applicable, operate their properties or to carry on their
respective business substantially as it is being conducted as of the date of
this Agreement (the " _WPG Permits_ "), and all such WPG Permits are valid and
in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in possession of, or
the failure to be valid or in full force and effect of, any of the WPG
Permits, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a WPG Material Adverse Effect. All applications
required to have been filed for the renewal of WPG Permits have been duly
filed on a timely basis with the appropriate Governmental Authority, and all
other filings required to have been made with respect to such WPG Permits have
been duly made on a timely basis with the appropriate Governmental Authority,
except in each case for failures to file which, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a WPG
Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2012, neither WPG nor any WPG
Subsidiary has received any claim or notice from a Government Authority nor
has any knowledge indicating that WPG or any WPG Subsidiary is currently not
in compliance with the terms of any such WPG Permits, except where the failure
to be in compliance with the terms of any such WPG Permits, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a WPG
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) Since January 1, 2012, none of WPG, WPG LP or any other WPG Subsidiary is
or has been in conflict with, or in default or violation of (i) any Law
applicable to WPG, WPG LP or any other WPG Subsidiary or by which any property
or asset of WPG, WPG LP or any other WPG Subsidiary is bound or (ii) any WPG
Permits, except in each case for any such conflicts, defaults or violations
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a WPG Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.6 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) WPG has filed with, or furnished (on a publicly available basis) to, the
SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements and documents required to be
filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the
case may be, including any amendments or supplements thereto, from and after
May 6, 2014 (collectively, the " _WPG SEC Filings_ "). Each WPG SEC Filing, as
amended or supplemented, if applicable, (i) as of its date, or, if amended or
supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or supplement
thereto, complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time it
was filed (or became effective in the case of registration statements), or, if
amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or
supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement,
neither WPG LP nor any other WPG Subsidiary is separately subject to the
periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.

 



 

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained or incorporated by
reference in the WPG SEC Filings (as amended, supplemented or restated, if
applicable), including the related notes and schedules, was prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and each such
consolidated financial statement presented fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position, results of operations, shareholders
equity and cash flows of WPG and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to the
absence of notes and normal year-end adjustments).

 



 

(c) WPG and WPG Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including that: (1)
transactions are executed only in accordance with managements authorization
and (2) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the
financial statements of WPG and WPG Subsidiaries and to maintain
accountability for the assets of WPG and WPG Subsidiaries. Since January 1,
2012, and to WPGs knowledge, WPG has disclosed to WPGs auditors and the
audit committee of the WPG Board (i) all significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material
respect WPGs ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data,
and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in WPGs internal controls, and WPG has
made available to Glimcher copies of any material written materials relating
to the foregoing. The disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by WPG are reasonably
designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by WPG
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC and that all such information required to be
disclosed is

 



       
 

 



 

accumulated and communicated to the management of WPG to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable WPGs principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer to make the
certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

 



 

(d) Except as and to the extent disclosed or reserved against on WPGs most
recent balance sheet (or in the notes thereto) included in the WPG SEC
Filings, none of WPG or its consolidated subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise)
required by GAAP to be reflected or reserved against in a consolidated balance
sheet (or in the notes thereto), except for liabilities or obligations (i)
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since the most recent balance sheet set forth in the WPG SEC Filings, (ii)
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a WPG Material Adverse Effect or (iii) incurred in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder.

 



 

(e) Except as set forth in _Section 5.6(e)_ of the WPG Disclosure Letter, to
the knowledge of WPG, none of the WPG SEC Filings is as of the date of this
Agreement the subject of ongoing SEC review and WPG has not received any
comments from the SEC with respect to any of the WPG SEC Filings which remains
unresolved, nor has it received any inquiry or information request from the
SEC as of the date of this Agreement as to any matters affecting WPG which has
not been adequately addressed.

(a) None of the information supplied or to be supplied in writing by or on
behalf of WPG, WPG LP or any other WPG Subsidiary for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time such document
is filed with the SEC, at any time such document is amended or supplemented or
at the time such document is declared effective by the SEC, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
(ii) the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the
shareholders of Glimcher and at the time of the Glimcher Shareholder Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.7(b)_ or this
Agreement, neither WPG nor WPG LP makes any representation or warranty with
respect to statements made or incorporated, or omissions included, in the Form
S-4 or the Proxy Statement to the extent such statements or omissions are
based upon information supplied to WPG by or on behalf of a Glimcher Party.

each other WPG Subsidiary has conducted its business in all material respects

there have been duly and timely filed on its behalf) with the appropriate
Governmental Authority all U.S. federal income and all other material Tax
Returns required to be filed by it (taking into account any extensions of time
within which to file such Tax Returns), and all such Tax Returns are true,
correct and complete in all material respects, and (ii) duly and timely paid
in full (or there has been duly and timely paid in full on its behalf) all
material Taxes required to be paid by it, whether or not shown (or required to

good faith by appropriate proceedings or for which adequate reserves have been
established in the consolidated financial statements contained in the WPG SEC
Filings in accordance with GAAP).

 



 

(b) The financial statements contained in the WPG SEC Filings reflect an
adequate reserve (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to
reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) for all material Taxes
payable by WPG and the WPG Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions
thereof through the date of such financial statements. To the knowledge of
WPG, the Taxes payable by WPG and the WPG Subsidiaries since the date of the
financial statements contained in the last WPG SEC filings through the Closing
Date with respect to all taxable periods and portions thereof through the
Closing Date will not materially exceed such reserve as adjusted through the
Closing Date for the passage of time and ordinary course business operations

itself and its Affiliates to the other Parties and provide such other Party
such assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Proxy Statement. Each
of Glimcher and WPG shall promptly notify the Parties upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement, and shall, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, provide the Parties with copies of all
correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement or the Form S-4 received from the SEC and advise the Parties of any
oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement or

 



      
 

 



 

the Form S-4 received from the SEC. Each of Glimcher and WPG shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments
from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and the Form S-4.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments from the SEC with respect
thereto, each of Glimcher and WPG shall cooperate and provide the Parties a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response
(including the proposed final version of such document or response). WPG shall
advise Glimcher, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time of
effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto
or the suspension of the qualification of the WPG Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Acquisition Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, and WPG and Glimcher shall use their reasonable best efforts to
have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise
terminated. WPG shall also take any other action required to be taken under

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of Glimcher Shareholder Approval, any
information relating to Glimcher or WPG, or any of their respective
Affiliates, should be discovered by Glimcher or WPG which, in the reasonable
judgment of Glimcher or WPG, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and
Glimcher and WPG shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4
and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the information contained
in such amendment or supplement to shareholders of Glimcher and the
stockholders of WPG. Nothing in this _Section 6.3(b)_ shall limit the
obligations of any Party under _Section 6.3(a)_. For purposes of _Section
4.7_, _Section 5.7_ and this _Section 6.3_, any information concerning or
related to Glimcher, its Affiliates or Glimcher Shareholder Meeting will be
deemed to have been provided by Glimcher, and any information concerning or
related to WPG or its Affiliates will be deemed to have been provided by WPG.

of Trust and Glimcher Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold Glimcher Shareholder Meeting; _provided_ ,
_however_ , Glimcher will have the right to make one or more successive
postponements or adjournments of the Glimcher Shareholder Meeting (i) if on a

received proxies representing a sufficient number of Glimcher Common Shares to
obtain the Glimcher Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present
or (ii) to the extent necessary to ensure that any amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement or Form S-4 is timely provided to the holders of Glimcher
Common Shares; _provided_ , _further_ , that any particular adjournment shall
be no longer than 30 days after the date on which the Glimcher Shareholder
Meeting was

 



      
 

 



 

scheduled (either originally or as adjourned) and no postponement shall
provide for the Glimcher Shareholder Meeting to occur on any day after the
date that is twenty (20) Business Days prior to the Outside Date. Glimcher
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the shareholders of Glimcher entitled to vote at Glimcher
Shareholder Meeting and to hold the Glimcher Shareholder Meeting as soon as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act,
subject to the immediately prior sentence. Glimcher shall, through the
Glimcher Board, recommend to its shareholders that they give Glimcher
Shareholder Approval, include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and
solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain Glimcher Shareholder
Approval, unless the Glimcher Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation
Change as permitted by _Section 6.5(d)_; _provided_ , _however_ , Glimchers
obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold Glimcher Shareholder
Meeting shall be unconditional unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms and shall not be affected by any Adverse
Recommendation Change.

6.4_ to provide the other Parties or their Representatives with access to or
to disclose information (x) if such access or disclosure would result in a
breach of an agreement with a Third Party entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the disclosing Party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of such Third Party
to such access or disclosure), (y) the disclosure of which would violate any
Law or legal duty of the Party or any of its Representatives ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the disclosing Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not
in violation of any Law or legal duty), or (z) that is subject to any
attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the disclosing Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does not result
in a loss of any such attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal
privilege).

 



 

(b) Any non-public information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall
be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.5 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this _Section 6.5_, during the Interim

merger agreement, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, share
exchange agreement or option agreement (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this _Section 6.5_)
providing for or relating to an Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 6.5(a)_ or anything else in this Agreement to
the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining Glimcher Shareholder Approval,
Glimcher or any Glimcher Entity may, directly or indirectly through any
Representative, in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal by a Third Party made after the date of this Agreement, (i) furnish
non-public information to such Third Party making an Acquisition Proposal and
its Representatives ( _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) prior to so furnishing
such information, Glimcher receives from the Third Party an executed
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) any non-public information
concerning the Glimcher Entities that is provided to such Third Party shall,
to the extent not previously provided to the WPG Parties, be provided to the
WPG Parties prior to or substantially at the same time that such information
is provided to such Third Party), and (ii) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such Third Party and its Representatives with respect to the
Acquisition Proposal if, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), the
Glimcher Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or
could reasonably be likely to result in, a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(c) Glimcher shall notify WPG promptly (but in no event later than twenty-four
(24) hours) after receipt by an officer of Glimcher or trustee on the Glimcher
Board of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry from any Person seeking to
have discussions or negotiations with any Glimcher Entity or any of its
Representatives relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall
be made orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the identity of
the Third Party making the Acquisition Proposal or such inquiry and the
material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposals or inquiries
(including a copy thereof if in writing and any drafts and final versions of
agreements related thereto (which documentation may be redacted to the extent
necessary to protect confidential information of the business or operations of
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry)). Glimcher shall also
promptly, and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours, notify WPG orally
and in writing, if any Glimcher Entity or any of its Representatives enters
into discussions or negotiations

 



      
 

 



 

concerning any Acquisition Proposal or provides non-public information or data
to any Person in accordance with _Section 6.5(b)_ and keep WPG reasonably
informed of the status and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposals on
a reasonably current basis, including by providing a copy of all drafts and
final versions of agreements relating thereto (which may be redacted to the
extent necessary to protect confidential information of the business or
operations of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal).

 



 

(d) Except as permitted by this _Section 6.5(d)_, neither the Glimcher Board

fail to publicly recommend against any Acquisition Proposal, or fail to
publicly reaffirm the Glimcher Recommendation, in each case, within ten (10)
Business Days after the written request of WPG following an Acquisition
Proposal that has been publicly announced (or such fewer number of days as
remains prior to the Glimcher Shareholder Meeting, as it may be adjourned or
postponed) (any of the actions described in clauses _(i)_ , _(ii)_ , ( _iii_ )
or ( _iv_ ) of this _Section 6.5(d)_, an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_
"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement (A)
at any time prior to obtaining the Glimcher Shareholder Approval, if the
Glimcher Board (x) has received an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal
that was not solicited in breach of this _Section 6.5_ and that, in the good-
faith determination of the Glimcher Board, after consultation with outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after
having complied with, and giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be
offered by the WPG Parties pursuant to _Section 6.5(e)_ and (y) determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to
take such action could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
trustees duties under applicable Law, then in such case Glimcher may (i)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ or (ii) make an
Adverse Recommendation Change, and, in the case of a termination, Glimcher may
immediately prior to or concurrently with such termination of this Agreement,
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal; or (B) other than in response to an Acquisition Proposal, if the
Glimcher Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action could reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the trustees duties under applicable Law, Glimcher may make
an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

(e) The Glimcher Board shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 6.5(d)_ or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ unless (i) Glimcher has provided a
written notice (a " _Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") to the WPG
Parties that the Glimcher Board intends to take such action, specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons therefor and, in the case of an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 6.5(d)(A)_, describing the
material terms and conditions of, and attaching a complete copy of, the
Superior Proposal that is the basis of such action (it being understood that
such material terms shall include the identity of the Third Party, but which
documentation may be redacted to the extent necessary to protect confidential
information of the business or operations of the Person making such Superior
Proposal), (ii) during the 72-hour period following the WPG Parties receipt
of the Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change (the " _Negotiation Period_ "),
Glimcher shall, and shall cause its

 



      
 

 



 

Representatives to, negotiate with the WPG Parties in good faith (to the
extent the WPG Parties request to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement to obviate the need to make such
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement, and (iii) following
the end of such 72-hour period, the Glimcher Board shall have determined in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed in
writing by the WPG Parties in response to the Notice of Adverse Recommendation
Change or otherwise, (x) that in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to _Section 6.5(d)(A)_, the Superior Proposal giving rise to the
Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal, and (y) in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to
_Section 6.5(d)(B)_, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
failure to take such action could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the trustees duties under applicable Law. Any material change to the
terms of such Superior Proposal, including any change to the financial terms,
shall require a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change and the provisions
of this _Section 6.5(e)_ shall apply one additional time to such Superior
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that in connection with the second
Negotiation Period, if any, references to 72-hours above shall be deemed to be
references to 48-hours instead. In no event will there be more than two (2)
Negotiation Periods and Glimcher will not be required to deliver more than two
(2) Notices of Adverse Recommendation Change or to comply with any of the
other provisions of this _Section 6.5(e)_ that would have otherwise been
applicable had Glimcher delivered additional Notices of Adverse Recommendation
Change.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit Glimcher or the Glimcher Board, directly or indirectly through
its Representatives, from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under
applicable Law with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and
disclosing to Glimchers shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any disclosure to
its shareholders if the Glimcher Board has determined, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so could reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with the trustees duties under applicable Law or (ii)
making a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication to the holders of
Glimcher Common Shares of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , the foregoing shall not permit the
Glimcher Board to make any Adverse Recommendation Change except as permitted
by _Section 6.5(d)_ and _Section 6.5(e)_.

 



 

(g) Upon execution of this Agreement, Glimcher shall, and shall cause each of
the other Glimcher Entities, and its and their officers and directors and
direct its other Representatives to (i) immediately cease any existing
discussions, negotiations or communications with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and (ii) take such action
as is necessary to enforce any confidentiality provisions or provisions of
similar effect to which any Glimcher Entity is a party or of which any
Glimcher Entity is a beneficiary. Glimcher shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause all Third Parties who have been furnished confidential information
regarding any Glimcher Entity in connection with the solicitation of or
discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal within the six (6) months prior
to the date of this Agreement to promptly return or destroy such information
(to the extent that they are entitled to have such information returned or
destroyed).

 



      
 

 



 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any proposal or offer made by any
Person, whether in one transaction or a series of related transactions,
relating to (i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination or similar transaction involving any of the Glimcher Entities,
(ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, license, transfer or other
disposition, directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, sale of equity
interests, share exchange, joint venture, business combination or otherwise,
of any assets of any Glimcher Entity representing fifteen percent (15%) or
more of the consolidated assets of the Glimcher Entities, taken as a whole as
determined on a book-value basis (including any Indebtedness secured solely by
such asset), (iii) any issue, sale or other disposition of (including by way
of merger, consolidation, joint venture, business combination, share exchange
or any similar transaction) securities (or options, rights or warrants to
purchase, or securities convertible into, such securities) representing
fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting power of Glimcher, (iv) any tender
offer or exchange offer in which any Person or " _group_ " (as such term is
defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) shall seek to
acquire beneficial ownership (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act), or the right to acquire beneficial
ownership, of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the outstanding shares of any
class of voting securities of Glimcher, or (v) any recapitalization,
restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other similar type of transaction
with respect to Glimcher in which a Third Party shall acquire beneficial
ownership of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the outstanding shares of any
class of voting securities of Glimcher; _provided_ , _however_ , that the term
"Acquisition Proposal" shall not include the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal (except that, for purposes of this definition, the references in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" to "fifteen percent (15%)" shall be
replaced by "fifty percent (50%)") made by a Third Party on terms that the
Glimcher Board determines in good faith, after consultation with Glimchers
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, would result, if consummated, in
a transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to the
holders of Glimcher Common Shares than the Mergers and other transactions
contemplated hereby after taking into account the likelihood and timing of
consummation (as compared to the transactions contemplated hereby) and such
other matters that the Glimcher Board deems relevant, including legal,
financial (including the financing terms of any such Acquisition Proposal),
regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and the identity of
the Person making such proposal.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
Glimcher and each of the WPG Parties shall and shall cause the other Glimcher
Entities and the other WPG Entities, respectively, to use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or pursuant to any
contract or agreement to consummate and make effective, as promptly as
practicable, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) the taking of all actions necessary to cause the
conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied, (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents (including
the Lender

 



      
 

 



 

Consents) and approvals from Governmental Authorities or other Persons
necessary in connection with the consummation of the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities, if
any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an
approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Authority or other Persons necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including promptly responding to all requests by a Governmental
Authority or other Person for additional information in support of any such
filing or request for approval or waiver), (iii) the defending of any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental
Authority vacated or reversed, the avoidance of each and every impediment
under any antitrust, merger control, competition or trade regulation Law that
may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Mergers so
as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of the WPG
Parties and the Glimcher Parties shall give (or shall cause the other WPG
Entities or the other Glimcher Entities, respectively, to give) any notices to
Third Parties, and each of the WPG Parties and the Glimcher Parties shall use,
and cause each of their respective Affiliates to use, its reasonable best
efforts to obtain any Third Party consents not covered by _Section 6.6(a)_
that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Mergers. Each of the
Parties will furnish to the other Parties such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other Parties may request in connection with the
preparation of any required governmental filings or submissions and will
cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority,
including promptly informing the other Parties of such inquiry, consulting in
advance before making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental
Authority, and supplying each other with copies of all material
correspondence, filings or communications between either Party and any
Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement. The Parties or their
Representatives shall have the right to review in advance and each of the
Parties will consult the others on, all the information relating to the other
Parties and each of their Affiliates that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority in connection with
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except
that confidential competitively sensitive business information may be redacted
from such exchanges. To the extent reasonably practicable, none of the Parties
shall, nor shall they permit their respective Representatives to, participate
independently in any meeting or engage in any substantive conversation with
any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing, investigation or other
inquiry without giving the other Party prior notice of such meeting or
conversation and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, without giving
the other Parties the opportunity to attend or participate (whether by
telephone or in person) in any such meeting with such Governmental Authority.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.6_ to the contrary, Glimcher
shall not be required pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ to propose, commit to or
effect any action that is not conditioned on the consummation of the Mergers.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters; Transaction Litigation_.

 



 

(a) Glimcher shall give prompt notice to WPG, and WPG shall give prompt notice
to Glimcher, of any notice or other communication received by such Party or
its Subsidiaries from any Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Glimcher shall give prompt notice to WPG, and WPG shall give prompt notice
to Glimcher, if (i) any representation or warranty made by it or its
Subsidiaries contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such
that it would be reasonable to expect that the applicable closing conditions
would be incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date or (ii) it or its
Subsidiaries fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties
or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement and
the failure to comply with this _Section 6.7_ will not constitute a breach or
noncompliance of a covenant by such Party for determining the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(b)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_. Without
limiting the foregoing, Glimcher shall give prompt notice to WPG, and WPG
shall give prompt notice to Glimcher, if, to the knowledge of such Party, the
occurrence of any state of facts, change, development, event or condition
would cause, or would reasonably be expected to cause, any of the conditions
to Closing set forth herein not to be satisfied or satisfaction to be
materially delayed.

 



 

(c) Each of the Parties agrees to give prompt written notice to the other
Parties upon becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any
event or circumstance relating to it or any of the other Glimcher Entities or
the other WPG Entities, respectively, which could reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Glimcher Material Adverse Effect or
a WPG Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be.

 



 

(d) Glimcher shall give prompt notice to WPG, and WPG shall give prompt notice
to Glimcher, of any Action commenced or, to such Partys knowledge, threatened
against, relating to or involving such Party or any of the other Glimcher
Entities or the other WPG Entities, respectively, which relate to this
Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Glimcher shall give the WPG Parties the opportunity to reasonably
participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, in (but not
control) the defense and settlement of any shareholder litigation against any
Glimcher Entity and/or its directors relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without WPGs prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld). The WPG Parties shall give Glimcher the opportunity to reasonably
participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, in (but not
control) the defense and settlement of any stockholder litigation against the
WPG Parties and/or their directors relating to

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without Glimchers prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld).

 



 

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to, or following an
Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, and except to the extent disclosed in or consistent with the Proxy
Statement and Form S-4, for so long as this Agreement is in effect, the
Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, to the extent
reasonably practicable, consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements or filings with respect to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and none of the
Parties shall issue any such press release or make any such public statement
or filing prior to such consultation; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Party
may, without consulting with the other Parties, issue such press release or
make such public statement or filing as may be required by Law, Order or the
applicable rules of any stock exchange or the applicable provisions of any
listing agreement of any Party hereto.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Acquisition Effective Time, the Surviving Entity and
its Subsidiaries shall, and WPG shall cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries to, (i) honor and maintain in effect for a period of six years
from the Acquisition Effective Time all rights to exculpation, indemnification
and advancement of expenses of each Indemnitee provided to such Indemnitee by
Glimcher and the Glimcher Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Acquisition
Effective Time in the Glimcher Declaration of Trust and the Glimcher Bylaws or
each of the Glimcher Subsidiaries respective articles, certificates of
incorporation, declaration of trust or bylaws (or comparable organizational or
governing documents) as the case may be, as in effect on the date of this
Agreement and (ii) honor all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses of each Indemnitee as provided in any indemnification
or other agreement to which Glimcher or any Glimcher Subsidiary is a party as
of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that such exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses covers actions or omissions at or
prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, including all transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. WPG further agrees that it shall not, and
shall cause the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries not to, amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any of the foregoing provisions in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees and that all rights
to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any
Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue
until the final disposition of such Action.

 



 

(b) Without limiting or being limited by the provisions of _Section 6.9(a)_,
during the period commencing as of the Acquisition Effective Time and ending
on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Acquisition Effective Time, the
Surviving Entity shall (and WPG shall cause the Surviving Entity to), to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law: (i) indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each Indemnitee against and from any costs or expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the
extent such Action arises out of or pertains to (x) the fact that the
Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, partner, member, trustee, fiduciary
or agent of Glimcher or any of the Glimcher Subsidiaries or a fiduciary under
any Glimcher Benefit Plan, including

 



       
 

 



 

any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnitees
capacity as a director, officer, partner, member, trustee, employee, fiduciary
or agent of Glimcher or any of the Glimcher Subsidiaries or as fiduciary under
any Glimcher Benefit Plan, or (y) this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Mergers, in each case, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Acquisition Effective Time; and (ii) pay in
advance of the final disposition of any such Action the expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses and disbursements and any expenses incurred by
any Indemnitee in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to
indemnification) of any Indemnitee without the requirement of any bond or
other security, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Law, but
subject to WPGs and the Surviving Entitys receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, WPG or
the Surviving Entity (i) shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without their prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), (ii) shall not have any obligation under
this Agreement to any Indemnitee to the extent that a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order that such
indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law, in which case the Indemnitee
shall promptly refund to WPG or the Surviving Entity the amount of all such
expenses theretofore advanced pursuant thereto (unless such court orders
otherwise) and (iii) shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in any Action (in which indemnification could be sought by a
Indemnitee hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes
an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability arising out of
such Action or such Indemnitee otherwise consents in writing.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Acquisition Effective Time, Glimcher may in its discretion,
in consultation with WPG, or, if Glimcher declines to do so, WPG may in its
discretion cause the Surviving Entity as of the Acquisition Effective Time to,
obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the
coverage afforded by Glimchers existing directors and officers liability
insurance policies and Glimchers existing fiduciary liability insurance
policies (collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case, for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Acquisition Effective Time with respect to any claim arising from facts, acts,
events or omissions that occurred during any period of time at or prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time from one or more insurance carriers with the
same or better Bests credit rating as Glimchers current insurance carrier
with respect to DandO Insurance with retentions and levels of coverage that are
no less favorable than, and with other terms and conditions that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than, the coverage provided under Glimchers
existing policies and with limits of liability that are no lower than the
limits on Glimchers existing policies as long as the annual premium in the
aggregate does not exceed, in any one year, three-hundred percent (300%) of
the annual aggregate premium(s) under Glimchers existing policies. If
Glimcher or the Surviving Entity for any reason fails to obtain such "tail"
insurance policies as of the Acquisition Effective Time, (i) the Surviving
Entity shall continue to maintain, and WPG shall cause to be maintained, in
effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Acquisition
Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement
with Glimchers current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with
the same or better Bests credit rating as Glimchers current insurance
carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with retentions and levels of coverage
that are no less favorable than, and with other terms and conditions that are
no less favorable in the aggregate than, the coverage

 



      
 

 



 

provided under Glimchers existing policies as of the date of this Agreement,
or (ii) WPG shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide, for
a period of not less than six (6) years after the Acquisition Effective Time,
the Indemnitees who are insured under Glimchers DandO Insurance with comparable
DandO Insurance that provides coverage for facts, events, acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Glimchers current
insurance carrier and with retentions and levels of coverage that are no less
favorable than, and with other terms and conditions that are no less favorable
in the aggregate than, the existing policy of Glimcher (which may be provided
under WPGs DandO Insurance policy) or, if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that WPG and the Surviving Entity shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of (for any one year) three-hundred
percent (300%) of the annual premium paid by Glimcher for such insurance as of
the date of this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, WPG or the Surviving
Entity shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available, with respect to facts, acts, events or omissions occurring prior to
the Partnership Merger Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



 

(d) The Indemnitees are third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.9_. The
provisions of this _Section 6.9_ shall be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnitee and his or her successors, heirs, executors,
trustees, fiduciaries, administrators or representatives. WPG shall pay all
reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnitee in successfully enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided in this _Section 6.9_.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 6.9_ shall be in
addition to any rights such Person or any employee of Glimcher or any Glimcher
Subsidiary may have under the Glimcher Declaration of Trust, the Glimcher
Bylaws or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent
organizational or governing documents) of any of the Glimcher Subsidiaries, or
the Surviving Entity or any of its subsidiaries, or under any applicable Law,
Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and
officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to Glimcher or its officers, trustees and employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section
6.9_ is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such
policies.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.7_ to
the contrary, this _Section 6.9_ shall survive the consummation of the
Mergers indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all
successors and assigns of WPG, the Surviving Entity and its subsidiaries, and
shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their successors, heirs,
executors, trustees, fiduciaries, administrators or representatives. In the
event that WPG or the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, WPG shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Entity to, cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of WPG or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.10 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
(i) prepare all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the tax treatment and
consequences contemplated by _Section 3.5_ (the " _Intended Tax Treatment_
"), (ii) except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a "final
determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign Law) not take any position on any
Tax Return, in connection with any Tax Proceeding or otherwise that is
inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment, (iii) not take any action (or
fail to take any action) if such action (or failure to act) could reasonably
be expected to cause the Acquisition Merger, the Deemed Liquidation or the
Partnership Merger not to have the Intended Tax Treatment and (iv) otherwise
use their reasonable efforts to cause the Acquisition Merger, the Deemed
Liquidation and the Partnership Merger to have the Intended Tax Treatment.

 



 

(b) Without limiting _Section 6.10(a)_, if WPG reasonably determines in good
faith that the Acquisition Merger, the Deemed Liquidation, and the Partnership
Merger, taking into account any Pre-Acquisition Restructuring, could
reasonably be expected not to result in the Intended Tax Treatment, then WPG
may require the contemplated transaction to be restructured in a manner that
would, in the reasonable, good-faith judgment of WPG, better assure such tax
treatment (or otherwise obtain a cost basis in the assets of Glimcher for U.S.
Federal income tax purposes and/or an adjustment to the adjusted basis of each
asset of Glimcher LP and its subsidiaries under Section 743(b) of the Code);
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such restructuring shall not (i) adversely
affect the consideration contemplated by this Agreement to be received by the
holders of the Glimcher Common Shares, Glimcher Preferred Shares, Glimcher LP
Units or Glimcher Preferred Units or the tax treatment contemplated by
_Section 3.5_ for the holders of the Glimcher Common Shares, Glimcher
Preferred Shares, Glimcher LP Units or Glimcher Preferred Units, (ii)
jeopardize or materially delay the Closing or (iii) require Glimcher or any
Glimcher Subsidiary to take any action in contravention of Law. In the event
the transaction is restructured pursuant to a request of WPG under this
_Section 6.10(b)_, none of the representations, warranties or covenants of
Glimcher or Glimcher LP shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed breached or
violated by, any transaction requested by WPG pursuant to this _Section
6.10(b)_. If Glimcher reasonably determines in good faith that the Partnership
Merger could reasonably be expected not to result in the Intended Tax
Treatment to the holders of Glimcher LP Units and Glimcher Preferred Units,
WPG will consider in good faith any proposed restructuring of the transactions
by Glimcher that would better assure such tax treatment. In the event of any
restructuring in accordance with this _Section 6.10(b)_, the Parties shall
amend this Agreement as necessary or appropriate to reflect such
restructuring.

 



 

(c) WPG shall, with Glimchers good faith cooperation and assistance, prepare,
execute and file, or cause to be prepared, executed and filed, all returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property
transfer, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer, recording,
registration stamp or similar Taxes that become payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_
") and WPG and Glimcher shall cooperate to minimize the amount of Transfer
Taxes to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) On the Closing Date, prior to the Acquisition Merger, Glimcher shall
deliver to WPG LP a duly executed certificate of non-foreign status, dated as
of the Closing Date, substantially in the form of the sample certification set
forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B).

 



 

Section 6.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Acquisition Effective Time,
Glimcher and WPG shall, as applicable, take all such steps to cause any
dispositions or acquisitions of Glimcher Common Share or WPG Common Stock
(including derivative securities related to Glimcher Common Shares or WPG
Common Stock, as applicable) resulting from the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to Glimcher as of immediately prior to the Acquisition Effective Time
or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to WPG, to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law. Upon request, Glimcher shall promptly furnish WPG
with all requisite information for WPG to take the actions contemplated by
this Section 6.11.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Stock Exchange Listing_. WPG shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause (i) the shares of WPG Common Stock to be issued in the
Acquisition Merger, (ii) shares of WPG Common Stock to be reserved for
issuance in connection with the Acquisition Merger and (iii) shares of New WPG
Preferred Stock to be issued in the Acquisition Merger, each to be approved
for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Acquisition Effective Time.

 



 

Section 6.13 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) As of the Acquisition Effective Time and for one (1) year thereafter, WPG
shall provide, or shall cause the WPG Subsidiaries to provide, each employee
of Glimcher or any Glimcher Subsidiaries who continues employment with WPG or
any WPG Subsidiary following the Acquisition Effective Time (other than such
employees covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement) (the " _Continuing
Employees_ "), (i) a base salary or regular hourly wage and target annual
bonus opportunities that are no less favorable than the base salary or regular
hourly wage and target annual bonus opportunities provided to each such
Continuing Employee by Glimcher and the Glimcher Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Acquisition Effective Time, and (ii) all other compensation and
employee benefits that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than those
provided to each such Continuing Employee by Glimcher and the Glimcher
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Acquisition Effective Time. Each
employee of Glimcher or any Glimcher Subsidiary who as of immediately prior to
the Acquisition Effective Time is covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement
shall be provided with compensation and benefits consistent with the terms of
the Collective Bargaining Agreement.

 



 

(b) WPG shall, or shall cause the WPG Subsidiaries to, cause its Benefit Plans
to take into account, for purposes of eligibility, vesting, levels of benefits
and benefit accrual thereunder, the service of the Continuing Employees with
Glimcher and the Glimcher Subsidiaries (including any predecessor entities) as
if such service were with WPG, to the same extent that such service was
credited under a comparable Glimcher Benefit Plan (except to the extent it
would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of service).

 



      
 

 



 

(c) From and after the Acquisition Effective Time, with respect to each
Continuing Employee (and their respective beneficiaries), WPG shall use
reasonable commercial efforts to cause each disability, medical, dental, or
health plan of WPG or the WPG Subsidiaries to (i) waive any preexisting
condition limitations to the extent such conditions were covered under the
applicable disability, medical, dental, or health plans of Glimcher or the
Glimcher Subsidiaries, (ii) honor under such plans any deductible, co-payment
and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Continuing Employees and their
respective beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to
commencement of participation in such WPG Benefit Plan, and (iii) waive any
waiting period limitation, evidence of insurability requirement or actively-
at-work requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such Continuing
Employee and their respective beneficiaries on or after the Acquisition
Effective Time to the extent such Continuing Employee or beneficiary had
satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous plan prior
to the Acquisition Effective Time.

 



 

(d) All fiscal year 2014 bonus amounts under annual bonus, sales and other
cash incentive plans of Glimcher and the Glimcher Subsidiaries (the "FY2014
Bonuses") will be calculated and paid (both in terms of timing and amount) in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (including as to
timing of determination of achievement of applicable performance targets and
as to timing of payment); provided, that, the applicable performance targets
may be adjusted, as reasonably determined by the Glimcher Board (or a
committee thereof) prior to the Closing Date and approved by WPG (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld), to reflect any non-recurring
charges incurred or accrued by Glimcher and the Glimcher Subsidiaries during
the 2014 fiscal year (whether prior to or following the Acquisition Effective
Time) that arise as a direct result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that would not reasonably be expected to have been incurred by
Glimcher and the Glimcher Subsidiaries had the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement not taken place.

 



 

(e) No later than May 31, 2015, WPG shall, or shall cause an applicable WPG
Subsidiary to, grant long-term incentive awards (under the applicable WPG
Equity Plan(s)) to eligible Continuing Employees, with such grants to be made
in the ordinary course of business and consistent with the past practices of
Glimcher and the Glimcher Subsidiaries (including as to timing and amount of
such grants).

 



 

(f) In the event that WPG and Glimcher reasonably determine that the
Acquisition Effective Time will not occur prior to December 31, 2014, to the
extent reasonably requested by WPG, Glimcher and the Glimcher Subsidiaries
shall, in order to mitigate the impact of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code,
make or deliver payments or awards in 2014 that (i) are earned in 2014 and
payable in the ordinary course of business in 2015, or (ii) would be earned or
eligible to be earned in the ordinary course of business in 2014, but that
Glimcher and WPG reasonably determine in 2014 are substantially certain to be
earned in whole or in part.

 



 

(g) Nothing herein shall (i) be treated as an amendment to any Benefit Plan,
(ii) limit the ability of WPG to amend or terminate any Benefit Plan in
accordance with its terms at any time, (iii) limit the ability of WPG to
retain or terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee, or (iv) create
any third-party beneficiary rights in any current or former director, officer,
employee, or independent contractor of Glimcher or the Glimcher Subsidiaries,
or any beneficiary or dependent thereof, with respect to the compensation,
terms, and conditions

 



      
 

 



 

of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any Continuing Employee
by WPG or the WPG Subsidiaries or under any Benefit Plan which WPG or the WPG
Subsidiaries may maintain or otherwise.

 



 

Section 6.14 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Glimcher shall, and shall cause the other Glimcher Entities and their
respective Representatives to, use their reasonable best efforts to provide
all cooperation reasonably requested by WPG that is necessary, proper or
advisable in connection with the arrangement, marketing and consummation of
any Financing by the WPG Parties or their Affiliates in connection with the
Mergers and the other transactions pursuant thereto or contemplated hereby (
_provided_ , _however_ , that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of Glimcher or the Glimcher
Subsidiaries), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) participate as
reasonably requested in, and provide assistance to WPG with, the marketing
efforts related to any such Financing; (ii) participate as reasonably
requested by WPG (including the participation in a reasonable number of
meetings by senior management) and provide assistance to WPG in the
preparation of rating agency presentations and meetings with rating agencies,
roadshows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and meetings with
prospective lenders and debt investors, in each case, with respect to the
Financing; (iii) deliver to WPG Parties and their Financing Sources as
promptly as reasonably practicable such financial and other information
relating to Glimcher customary or reasonably necessary for the completion of
any such Financing to the extent reasonably requested by WPG in connection
with the preparation of customary offering or information documents to be used
for any such Financing, including all information and data necessary to
satisfy Section 2 of the Debt Financing Commitment; (iv) cause its independent
auditors to cooperate with any such Financing consistent with their customary
practice, including assisting WPG in obtaining (A) customary consents

that the information provided by Glimcher for inclusion in the public side
versions of such documents, if any, does not include material non-public
information about Glimcher or its Subsidiaries or their respective securities.
Glimcher hereby consents to the use of all of its and the Glimcher
Subsidiaries logos in connection with any such Financing, provided that such
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely
to harm or disparage Glimcher or the Glimcher Subsidiaries or the reputation
or goodwill of Glimcher or any Glimcher Subsidiary. None of the
representations, warranties or covenants of Glimcher shall be deemed breached
or violated by any action taken by Glimcher at the request of any WPG Party or
their Financing Sources pursuant to this _Section 6.14(a)_. Anything in this
_Section 6.14(a)_ to the contrary notwithstanding, until the Acquisition
Effective Time occurs, neither Glimcher nor any of the Glimcher Subsidiaries,
nor any of their respective officers, directors or Representatives, as the
case may be, shall be required to (x) pay any commitment or other similar fee,
reimburse any

 



      
 

 



 

expenses, provide any indemnities or incur or assume any obligations in
connection with any proposed Financing, (y) enter into any definitive
agreement related to any proposed Financing the effectiveness of which is not
conditioned upon consummation of the Mergers or (z) take any action that would
reasonably be expected to conflict with or violate the Glimcher Declaration of
Trust, the Glimcher Bylaws or any of the Glimcher Subsidiaries respective
organizational or governing documents. WPG shall promptly, upon request by
Glimcher, reimburse Glimcher for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred
by Glimcher or any of the Glimcher Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives in connection with any action taken by any of them at the
request of the WPG Parties or their Financing Sources pursuant to, and in
accordance with this _Section 6.14(a)_, and shall indemnify and hold harmless
Glimcher, the Glimcher Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from
and against any and all damages, losses, costs, claims, interest, awards,
judgments, penalties, liabilities or expenses suffered or incurred by any of
them in connection with the arrangement of any such Financing and any
information used in connection therewith (other than information provided by
Glimcher or any of the Glimcher Subsidiaries) and all other actions taken by
Glimcher, the Glimcher Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives at
the request of the WPG Parties or their Financing Sources pursuant to this
Section 6.14(a), except to the extent finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have arisen from any Glimcher Partys or its
respective Representatives fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct,
intentional misrepresentation or bad faith. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary provided herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement, the WPG Entities
and their Representatives shall be permitted to disclose information
consistent with customary practices in connection with any such Financing
subject to customary confidentiality arrangements.

 



 

(b) WPG and the other WPG Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, advisable or proper to obtain the Financing on or prior to the
Closing Date on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing
Commitment, including using reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect
and enforce their rights under the Debt Financing Commitment and comply with
its obligations thereunder (provided, that the Debt Financing Commitment may
be amended, supplemented, modified and replaced as set forth below); (ii)
satisfy on a timely basis and in a manner that will not impede the ability of
the parties to consummate the Mergers in advance of the Outside Date all
conditions applicable to WPG to the funding of the loans contemplated by Debt
Financing Commitment (including the Financing Conditions) set forth in the
Debt Financing Commitment and any definitive agreements executed in connection
therewith within WPGs control (other than any condition where the failure to
be so satisfied is a direct result of Glimchers failure to furnish
information to WPG or otherwise to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement) and (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitment (including, if necessary, any "flex" provisions).WPG shall keep
Glimcher informed on a regular basis and in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Financing and shall give Glimcher prompt notice of
any fact, change, event or circumstance that has had or is reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse impact with
respect to the Financing.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing, WPG shall not agree to or permit any termination,
amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of
its material rights

 



      
 

 



 

under, the Debt Financing Commitment without Glimchers prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ , that WPG may, without Glimchers prior written consent, (x) enter
into any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver
of any provision of the Debt Financing Commitment that would not reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of
the Financing or the Mergers, and (y) amend, replace, supplement or otherwise
modify the Debt Financing Commitment to add lenders, lead arrangers, book
runners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Financing Commitment as of the date of this Agreement so long as any such
addition would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the consummation of the Financing or the Mergers (it being
understood that any such amendment, replacement, supplement or modification
that provides for the assignment of a portion of the commitments under the
Debt Financing Commitment to any additional lenders, lead arrangers, book
runners, syndication agents or similar entities and the granting to such
persons of approval rights in accordance with the term of the syndication
provisions of the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date of this Agreement
as are customarily granted to additional agents or arrangers, shall be
permitted hereunder and shall be deemed to not prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the consummation of the Financing or the Mergers). Upon any
such amendment, replacement, supplement or modification, the term "Debt
Financing Commitment" shall mean the Debt Financing Commitment as so amended,
replaced, supplemented or modified and the term "Financing" shall mean any
such financings contemplated thereunder. WPG shall promptly deliver to
Glimcher copies of any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other
modification or waiver of the Debt Financing Commitment.

respect to the Glimcher Credit Agreement and any other Indebtedness of
Glimcher or any of the Glimcher Subsidiaries identified by WPG in writing at
least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (or with respect to any
Indebtedness that requires a notice period to repay any such Indebtedness,
five (5) Business Days prior to the first day of such notice period), (a)
Glimcher shall, or shall cause the applicable Glimcher Subsidiary to, use
reasonable best efforts to deliver all notices and take other actions required
to facilitate the termination of commitments in respect of such Indebtedness,
repayment in full of all obligations (or in the case of any letters of credit,
cash collateralization, to the extent that Parent shall not have entered into
an alternative arrangement with the issuing bank) in respect of such
Indebtedness and release of any Liens and guarantees in connection therewith
on the Closing Date and (b) Glimcher shall use reasonable best efforts to
deliver to WPG a customary payoff letter with respect to the Glimcher Credit
Agreement and each such other Indebtedness, executed by the lenders thereunder
(or the applicable agent thereunder on their behalf), in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to WPG, no later than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date (or such later date as WPG may agree in writing, but in any
event, on or prior to the Closing Date), setting forth all amounts (including
the outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest and all prepayment,
defeasance or other fees and penalties) required to be paid by Glimcher or any
other Glimcher Entity under the Glimcher Credit Agreement or such other
Indebtedness to cause the termination thereof on the Closing Date and the
release of all Liens, if any, in connection therewith on the assets of
Glimcher or any Glimcher Subsidiary or otherwise on the business or operations
of Glimcher or any of the Glimcher Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Funded
Debt Payoff Amount_ "); in each case, conditioned on the consummation of the

of this Agreement, to make any prepayments with respect to the amounts
outstanding under the Glimcher Credit Agreement or in respect of such other
Indebtedness (x) prior to the Closing Date and (y) unless WPG or WPG LP
provides funds to Glimcher in an amount sufficient to, or places in escrow or
otherwise pays on behalf of such Glimcher Entity, the Funded Debt Payoff
Amount.

its reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff
and to cause a definitive proxy statement related to such shareholders

amendment or supplement. WPG agrees promptly to correct any information in the
proxy statement if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and WPG shall as promptly as

shall be an amount equal to WPGs most recent quarterly dividend, multiplied
by the number of days elapsed since the last dividend record date through and
including the day prior to the Closing Date occurs, and divided by the actual
number of days in the calendar quarter in which such dividend is declared. In
the event that a distribution with respect to Glimcher Common Shares permitted
under the terms of this Agreement has (i) a record date prior to the Closing
Date and (ii) has not been paid as of the Acquisition Effective

 



      
 

 



 

Time, the holders of Glimcher Common Shares shall be entitled to receive such

opinion will be subject to customary exceptions, assumptions and
qualifications and based on customary representations contained in an
officers certificate executed by Glimcher.

 



 

(f) _Required Pre-Acquisition Transactions_. The Required Pre-Acquisition
Transactions shall have been completed and WPG shall have been provided with
evidence, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to WPG, of the
completion of each enumerated step thereof.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Conditions to the Obligations of Glimcher_. The obligations of
Glimcher and Glimcher LP to effect the Mergers and to consummate the other

(to the extent permitted by

 



      
 

 



 

Law) waiver by Glimcher, at or prior to the Acquisition Effective Time, of the
following additional conditions:

 



 

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. (i) The representations and warranties
set forth in the first two sentences of _Section 5.2(a)_ (Capital Structure)
shall be true and correct in all respects (except for any _de minimis_
inaccuracies) as of the Closing Date as though made as of the Closing Date,
(ii) the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 5.1_
(Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries), _Section 5.2(a)_ (Capital
Structure) (except the first two sentences of _Section 5.2(a)_), _Section
5.3_ (Authority), _Section 5.16_ (Vote Required), _Section 5.17_ (Brokers)
and _Section 5.21_ (Takeover Statutes) shall be true and correct in all
material respects as of the Closing Date as though made as of the Closing
Date, and (iii) each of the other representations and warranties of the WPG
Parties contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct as of the
Closing Date as though made as of the Closing Date, except (x) in the case of
each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), representations and warranties that are
made as of a specific date shall be true and correct except for any _de
minimis_ inaccuracies (in the case of clause (i)), true and correct in all
material respects (in the case of clause (ii)) or true and correct, subject to
clause (y) (in the clause of clause (iii), in each case, only on and as of
such specified date, and (y) in the case of clause (iii), where the failure of
such representations or warranties to be true and correct (without giving
effect to any materiality or "WPG Material Adverse Effect" qualifications set
forth therein), individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have a WPG Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) _Agreements and Covenants_. The WPG Parties shall have performed or
complied in all material respects with all agreements and covenants required
by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by them on or prior to the
Closing Date.

 



 

(c) _Officer s Certificate_. WPG shall have delivered to Glimcher a
certificate, dated the date of the Closing and signed by an executive officer
of WPG, certifying to the effect that the conditions set forth in _Section
7.3(a)_ and _Section 7.3(b)_ have been satisfied.

 



 

(d) _Absence of WPG Material Adverse Effect_. Since the date of this

(e) _REIT Opinion_. Glimcher shall have received a written opinion of
nationally recognized tax counsel selected by WPG, dated as of the Closing
Date and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Glimcher, to the
effect that, since its spin-off from Simon Property Group on May 28, 2014,
WPGs actual organization and method of operation has enabled WPG to meet,
through the Acquisition Effective Time, the requirements for qualification and
taxation as a REIT under the Code, which opinion will be subject to customary
exceptions, assumptions and qualifications and based on customary
representations contained in an officers certificate executed by WPG.

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 



 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Acquisition Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the
Glimcher Shareholder Approval (except as otherwise expressly noted), as
follows:

 



 

(a) by mutual written agreement of each of WPG and Glimcher; or

 



 

(b) by either WPG or Glimcher, if:

 



 

(i) the Acquisition Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before April
16, 2015 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any
Party if the failure of such Party (and in the case of WPG, including the
failure of the other WPG Parties, and in the case of Glimcher, including the
failure of the other Glimcher Parties) to perform any of its obligations under
this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or resulted in, the failure of
the Acquisition Effective Time to be consummated on or before such date;

 



 

(ii) any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an
Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Mergers,
and such Order shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a Party (x) if the issuance of such
final, non-appealable Order was primarily due to the failure of such Party
(and in the case of WPG, including the failure of the other WPG Parties, and
in the case of Glimcher, including the failure of the other Glimcher Parties)
to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement, including pursuant to
_Section 6.6_ and (y) unless such Party shall have used its reasonable best
efforts to oppose any such Order and to have such Order vacated or made
inapplicable to the Mergers; or

 



 

(iii) the Glimcher Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained at a duly
held Glimcher Shareholder Meeting (including any adjournment or postponement
thereof) at which the Acquisition Merger has been voted upon; or

 



 

(c) by Glimcher:

 



 

(i) if any WPG Party shall have breached or failed to perform in any material
respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (x) would, or
would reasonably be expected to, result in a failure of a condition set forth
in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ and (y) cannot be cured on or before
the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Glimcher shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ if
Glimcher is then in material breach of any of its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement; or

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) at any time prior to the receipt of the Glimcher Shareholder Approval in
order to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section 6.5(d)_; _provided_ , that such
termination shall be null and void unless Glimcher shall substantially
concurrently pay the Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 8.3_.

 



 

(d) by WPG:

 



 

(i) if any Glimcher Party shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (x)
would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a failure of a condition
set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ and (y) cannot be cured on
or before the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that WPG shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ if
WPG is then in material breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) if (x) the Glimcher Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation
Change, or (y) Glimcher shall have willfully and materially breached its
obligations under _Section 6.5_, which material breach, in each case in this
clause (y), if curable by Glimcher, shall not have been fully cured by
Glimcher within five (5) calendar days following Glimchers receipt of written
notice of such material breach (provided that any material breach pursuant to
this clause (y) that results in an Acquisition Proposal that is publicly
disclosed shall not be curable).

 



 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are abandoned pursuant to _Section 8.1_, written notice thereof
shall be given to the other Party or Parties, specifying the provisions hereof
pursuant to which such termination is made and describing the basis therefor
in reasonable detail, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void
and of no further force or effect whatsoever without liability on the part of
any Party (or any of the other Glimcher Entities, the other WPG Entities or
any of Glimchers or WPGs respective Representatives), and all rights and
obligations of any Party hereto shall cease; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, (a) no such
termination shall relieve any Party of any liability or damages resulting from
or arising out of any fraud or willful and material breach of any covenant or
other agreement set forth in this Agreement, in which case the aggrieved party
shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity and
(b) the Confidentiality Agreement, the penultimate sentence of _Section
6.14_(a), the last two sentences of _Section 6.17(c)_, this _Section 8.2_,
_Section 8.3_, _Section 8.6_, _Article IX_ and the definitions of all
defined terms appearing in such sections shall survive any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated:

 



 

(i) by Glimcher pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_, then Glimcher shall pay to
WPG the Termination Fee, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account
designated by WPG as a condition to the effectiveness of such termination;

 



 

(ii) by either Glimcher or WPG pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, and (x)
after the date of this Agreement but prior to the date of the Glimcher
Shareholder Meeting, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to Glimcher
or any Person shall have publicly made an Acquisition Proposal (and such
Acquisition Proposal shall not have been publicly withdrawn before the
Glimcher Shareholder Meeting), and (y) Glimcher, within twelve (12) months of
the termination of this Agreement, consummates a transaction regarding, or
executes a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, then
Glimcher shall pay to WPG the Termination Fee (less, if previously paid
pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(iv)_ below, the WPG Expense Amount), by wire
transfer of same day funds to an account designated by WPG, not later than two
Business Days after the earlier of the execution of such definitive agreement
and the consummation of such transaction; _provided_ that, for purposes of
this _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_, the references to "fifteen percent (15%)" in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty
percent (50%)";

 



 

(iii) by WPG pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, then Glimcher shall pay to WPG
the Termination Fee, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account
designated by WPG, not later than two Business Days after such termination;
and

 



 

(iv) by either Glimcher or WPG pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ and after
the date of this Agreement but prior to the date of the Glimcher Shareholder
Meeting, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to Glimcher or any
Person shall have publicly made an Acquisition Proposal (and such Acquisition
Proposal shall not have been publicly withdrawn before the Glimcher
Shareholder Meeting), then Glimcher shall pay to WPG the amount of WPGs
actual out-of-pocket Expenses (subject to reasonable documentation) up to an
aggregate of $8,500,000 (such amount, the " _WPG Expense Amount_ "), by wire
transfer of same day funds to an account designated by WPG, not later than two
(2) Business Days after such termination.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Parties agree that under no circumstances shall Glimcher be required to pay
the Termination Fee or the WPG Expense Amount on more than one occasion, and
that in no event shall the aggregate payment by Glimcher to WPG pursuant to
_Section 8.3(a)_ be greater than the Termination Fee.

 



 

(c) Each of the Parties acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated
damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate WPG in the circumstances
in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources

 



      
 

 



 

expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these agreements, WPG would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Glimcher fails to timely pay any
amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ and, in order to obtain such
payment, WPG commences a suit that results in a judgment against Glimcher for
the payment of any amount set forth in this _Section 8.3_, Glimcher shall pay
WPG its costs and expenses in connection with such suit, together with
interest on such amount at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall
Street Journal (on the date such payment was required to be made) for the
period from the date such payment was required to be made through the date
such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum
permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions
of this _Section 8.3(d)_ shall apply with respect to any Termination Payment
required to be made hereunder.

 



 

(i) If Glimcher (the " _Termination Payor_ ") is required to pay WPG (the "
_Termination Payee_ ") a Termination Payment, such Termination Payment shall
be paid into escrow on the date such payment is required to be paid by the
Termination Payor pursuant to this Agreement by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an escrow account designated in accordance with this
_Section 8.3(d)_. In the event that the Termination Payor is obligated to pay
the Termination Payee the Termination Payment, the amount payable to the
Termination Payee in any tax year of the Termination Payee shall not exceed
the lesser of (i) the Termination Payment payable to the Termination Payee,
and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Termination
Payee without causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements
of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax year, determined
as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in
Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ ") and the
Termination Payee has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such
year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated
income which is not Qualifying Income), in each case, as determined by the
Termination Payees independent accountants, plus (B) in the event the
Termination Payee receives either (x) a letter from the Termination Payees
counsel indicating that the Termination Payee has received a ruling from the
IRS as described below in this _Section 8.3(d)_ or (y) an opinion from the
Termination Payees outside counsel as described below in this _Section
8.3(d)_, an amount equal to the excess of the Termination Payment less the
amount payable under clause (A) above.

 



 

(ii) To secure the Termination Payors obligation to pay these amounts, the
Termination Payor shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the
Termination Payment with an escrow agent selected by the Termination Payor on
such terms (subject to this _Section 8.3(d)_) as shall be mutually agreed
upon by the Termination Payor, the Termination Payee and the escrow agent. The
payment or deposit into escrow of the Termination Payment pursuant to this
_Section 8.3(d)_ shall be made at the time the Termination Payor is obligated
to pay the Termination Payee such amount pursuant to _Section 8.3_ by wire
transfer. The escrow agreement shall provide that the Termination Payment in
escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to the Termination Payee
unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i)
a letter from the Termination Payees independent accountants indicating the

 



      
 

 



 

maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Termination Payee
without causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such
amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and the Termination Payee has
$1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such year which is not
Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not
Qualifying Income), in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount
to the Termination Payee, or (ii) a letter from the Termination Payees
counsel indicating that (A) the Termination Payee received a ruling from the
IRS holding that the receipt by the Termination Payee of the Termination
Payment would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from
gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or
(B) the Termination Payees outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to
the effect that the receipt by the Termination Payee of the Termination
Payment should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from
gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in
which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Termination
Payment to the Termination Payee. The Termination Payor agrees to amend this
_Section 8.3(d)_ at the reasonable request of the Termination Payee in order
to (i) maximize the portion of the Termination Payment that may be distributed
to the Termination Payee hereunder without causing the Termination Payee to
fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, or
(ii) assist the Termination Payee in obtaining a favorable ruling or legal
opinion from its outside counsel, in each case, as described in this _Section
8.3(d)_. Any amount of the Termination Payment that remains unpaid as of the
end of a taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following
taxable year, subject to the foregoing limitations of this _Section 8.3(d)_.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Parties by action taken or
authorized by their respective boards of directors (or similar governing body
or entity) at any time before or after receipt of Glimcher Shareholder
Approval and prior to the Acquisition Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after Glimcher Shareholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be
(a) any amendment of this Agreement that, by applicable Law or in accordance
with the rules of any stock exchange, requires the further approval of the
shareholders of Glimcher without obtaining such further approval of such
shareholders, or (b) any amendment or change not permitted under applicable
Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed by each of the Parties.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Acquisition Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, the WPG Parties, on the one hand, and the Glimcher
Parties, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any
obligation or other act of the others, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of the others contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject to the proviso of _Section
8.4_, waive compliance with any agreement of the others or any condition of
such Parties contained herein. Except as required by applicable Law, no such
extension or waiver shall require the approval of the holders of Glimcher
Common Shares. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by
the Party or Parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure or delay by any Glimcher Party or WPG Party in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a

 



      
 

 



 

waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Party
incurring such Expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that Glimcher and WPG
shall share equally all Expenses related to the printing and filing of the
Form S-4 and the printing, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement,
other than attorneys and accountants fees; _provided_ , _further_ , that WPG
shall pay all Third Party fees and expenses incurred by any of the Glimcher
Entities in connection with seeking and obtaining Lender Consents.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Transfer Taxes_. From and after the Acquisition Effective Time,
the Surviving Entity shall pay or cause to be paid, without deduction or
withholding from any consideration or amounts payable to holders of the
Glimcher Common Shares, Glimcher Preferred Shares, Glimcher Preferred Units or
Glimcher LP Units except, in each case, as otherwise provided by _Section
3.6(c)_, all Transfer Taxes imposed in connection with the Acquisition Merger
or the Partnership Merger.

Agreement (except, in the case of termination, as set forth in _Section
8.2_), and after such time there shall be no liability in respect thereof
(except, in the case of termination, as set forth in _Section 8.2_), whether

participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. References to "this Agreement" shall include the Glimcher
Disclosure Letter and the WPG Disclosure Letter. When a reference is made in
this Agreement to an Article, Section, Appendix, Annex or Exhibit, such
reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Appendix, Annex or
Exhibit to, this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents
and headings for this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used
in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement
shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other
instrument made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein.
The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any Law defined or referred to
herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such
Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the
case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor Laws. References to a
Person are also to its successors and permitted assigns. All references to
"dollars" or "$" refer to currency of the United States of America (unless
otherwise expressly provided herein).

 



 

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future
Law or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully
separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof,
and (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect promptly the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Assignment; Delegation_. Other than to the Surviving Entity,
neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests or obligations hereunder
shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by any of the Parties
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other Parties.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits,
Annexes and Appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and

 



      
 

 



 

supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof.

 



 

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except (i) for
the provisions of _Section 6.9_ (from and after the Acquisition Effective
Time), which shall be to the benefit of the Parties referred to in such
section, (ii) each Financing Source shall be an express third-party
beneficiary of and shall be entitled to rely upon _Section 9.11_, _Section
9.12_ and _Section 9.14_ and this _Section 9.7_ and each such person may
enforce such provisions, (iii) following the Acquisition Effective Time and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
provisions of _Article III_ with respect to the rights of the holders of (A)
Glimcher Common Shares and Glimcher Restricted Shares that are Glimcher
Vesting Equity Awards to receive the Merger Consideration (less the Equity

B. _Distributions_.

 



 

1. The record holders of Series G Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive cash distributions, when, as and if authorized by the Board of Directors and declared by the Corporation, out of assets legally available for payment of distributions. Such distributions shall be payable quarterly by the Corporation in cash at a rate of 8.125% of the Liquidation Preference per annum (equivalent to $2.03125 per share of Series G Preferred Stock per annum) (the "Distribution Rate"); provided, however, that if following a Change of Control, the Series G Preferred Stock are not listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") or the NYSE AMEX ("AMEX"), or quoted on NASDAQ (or listed or quoted on a successor exchange or quotation system), record holders of Series G Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive cash distributions, when, as and if authorized by the Board of Directors and declared by the Corporation, out of assets legally available for payment of distributions, payable quarterly by the Corporation, from, but not including, the first date on which both the Change of Control has occurred and the Series G Preferred Stock are not so listed or quoted, in cash at a rate of 9.125% of the Liquidation Preference per annum (equivalent to $2.28125 per share of Series G Preferred Stock per annum), for as long as shares of Series G Preferred Stock are not so listed on the NYSE or AMEX or quoted on NASDAQ (or listed or quoted on a successor exchange or quotation system) (the "Special Distribution Rate").

 



 

2. Distributions on Series G Preferred Stock shall accrue and be cumulative at the Distribution Rate or Special Distribution Rate, as applicable, from the Original Issue Date. Distributions shall be payable quarterly in arrears when, as and if authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation on the 15th day of January, April, July and October of each year (each, a "Distribution Payment Date"), commencing on the 

 



      
 

 



 

Business Day next succeeding [*](2). If any Distribution Payment Date occurs
on a day that is not a Business Day, any accrued distributions otherwise
payable on such Distribution Payment Date shall be paid on the next succeeding
Business Day. The amount of distributions payable on Series G Preferred Stock
for each full Distribution Period shall be computed by dividing by four the
annual distribution rate set forth in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (B)
above. Distributions payable in respect of any Distribution Period which is
less than a full Distribution Period in length will be computed on the basis
of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Distributions shall be
paid to the holders of record of the Series G Preferred Stock as their names
shall appear on the share records of the Corporation at the close of business
on the Distribution Record Date for such distribution. Distributions in
respect of any past Distribution Periods that are in arrears may be declared
and paid at any time to holders of record on the Distribution Record Date
therefor. Any distribution payment made on Series G Preferred Stock shall be
first credited against the earliest accrued but unpaid distribution due which
remains payable. The Series G Preferred Stock shall rank on a parity with the
Series H Preferred Stock and the Series I Preferred Stock, as to distributions
in the manner and to the extent provided herein.

 



 

3. If any shares of Series G Preferred Stock are outstanding, no distributions (other than in Junior Stock) shall be authorized or paid or set apart for payment on any other class or series of Junior Stock or Parity Stock for any period unless full cumulative distributions have been or contemporaneously are authorized and paid or authorized and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment on the Series G Preferred Stock for all past Distribution Periods and the then current Distribution Period. When distributions are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not so set apart) upon the Series G Preferred Stock and any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity as to distributions with the Series G Preferred Stock, all distributions authorized upon the Series G Preferred Stock and any other such class or series of Preferred Stock shall be authorized pro rata so that the amount of distributions authorized per share on the Series G Preferred Stock and such class or series of Stock shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued and unpaid distributions per share on the Series G Preferred Stock and such class or series of Stock bear to each other. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any distribution payment or payments on the Series G Preferred Stock which may be in arrears.

 



 

4. Unless full cumulative distributions on the Series G Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are authorized and paid or authorized and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all past Distribution Periods and the then current Distribution Period, no Junior Stock or Parity Stock shall be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such stock) by the Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange for other Junior Stock).

 



 

5. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no distributions on Series G Preferred Stock shall be authorized by the Board of Directors of the

  (2) NTD: To insert first quarterly date after date of issuance.

 



      
 

 



 

Corporation or paid or set apart for payment by the Corporation at such time
as the terms and provisions of any agreement of the Corporation, including any
agreement relating to its indebtedness, prohibits such authorization, payment
or setting apart for payment or provides that such authorization, payment or
setting apart for payment would constitute a breach thereof or a default
thereunder, or to the extent such authorization, payment or setting apart for
payment shall be restricted or prohibited by law.

 



 

6. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, distributions on the Series G Preferred Stock, if not paid on the applicable Distribution Payment Date, will accrue without interest whether or not any agreement of the Corporation prohibits payment of such distributions, whether or not distributions are authorized for such Distribution Payment Date, whether or not the Corporation has earnings and whether or not there are assets legally available for the payment of such distributions.

 



 

7. If the Board of Directors determines that it is permissible under applicable law and that the distributions will qualify for the dividends paid deduction (within the meaning of Sections 561 and 562 of the Code or any successor provisions thereto), such distributions shall be paid as follows: first, from income of the Corporation other than net capital gains, and the balance, if any, from net capital gains of the Corporation. If the Board of Directors determines, in its sole discretion, that distributions to be paid in accordance with the preceding sentence might not qualify for such dividends paid deduction, or might not be permissible under applicable law, then such distributions shall be paid in a manner determined by the Board of Directors.

 



 

8. If, for any taxable year, the Corporation elects to designate as "capital gain dividends" (as defined in Section 857 of the Code or any successor revenue code or section) any portion (the "Capital Gains Amount") of the total dividends (as determined for United States federal income tax purposes) paid or made available for such taxable year to holders of all classes and series of Stock (the "Total Dividends"), then the portion of the Capital Gains Amount that shall be allocable to holders of Series G Preferred Stock shall be in the same proportion that the Total Dividends paid or made available to the holders of Series G Preferred Stock for such taxable year bears to the Total Dividends for such taxable year made with respect to all classes or series of Stock outstanding.

 



 

C. _Distributions Upon Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up_.

 



 

1. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, subject to the prior preferences and other rights of any Senior Stock as to liquidation preferences, but before any distribution or payment shall be made to the holders of any Junior Stock as to the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, the holders of Series G Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution to its shareholders liquidating distributions in cash or property at its fair market value as determined by the Board of Directors in the amount of the Liquidation Preference per share plus an amount equal to all distributions accrued and unpaid thereon (whether or not declared) to the date of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distributions to which they are

 



      
 

 



 

entitled, the shares of Series G Preferred Stock shall be cancelled and the
holders of Series G Preferred Stock will have no right or claim to any of the
remaining assets of the Corporation and shall not be entitled to any other
distribution in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
affairs of the Corporation.

 



 

2. In the event that, upon any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the legally available assets of the Corporation are insufficient to pay the amount of the Liquidation Preference per share plus an amount equal to all distributions accrued and unpaid on the Series G Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable on all shares of Parity Stock as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, then the holders of the Series G Preferred Stock and all such Parity Stock shall share ratably in any such distribution of assets in proportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they otherwise would be respectively entitled. The Series G Preferred Stock rank on a parity with the Series H Preferred Stock and Series I Preferred Stock as to the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation. Neither the consolidation or merger of the Corporation into or with another entity nor the dissolution, liquidation, winding up or reorganization of the Corporation immediately followed by incorporation of another corporation to which such assets are distributed, nor the sale, lease, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to another entity shall be deemed a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation within the meaning of this paragraph (C); provided that, in each case, effective provision is made in the articles of incorporation or similar organizational document of the resulting or surviving entity or otherwise for the recognition, preservation and protection of the rights of the holders of the Series G Preferred Stock.

 



 

3. In determining whether a distribution by dividend, redemption or other acquisition of Stock or otherwise is permitted under Indiana law, no effect shall be given to amounts that would be needed, if the Corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights on dissolution are superior to those receiving the distribution.

 



 

D. _Redemption by the Corporation_.

 



 

1. The Series G Preferred Stock may be redeemed for cash, in whole or from time to time in part, on any date on or after the Original Issue Date as fixed by the Board of Directors of the Corporation at the Redemption Price.

 



 

2. Each date fixed for redemption pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (D) is called a "Redemption Date." If the Redemption Date is after a Distribution Record Date and before the related Distribution Payment Date, the distribution payable on such Distribution Payment Date shall be paid to the holder in whose name the shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be redeemed are registered at the close of business on such Distribution Record Date notwithstanding the redemption thereof between such Distribution Record Date and the related Distribution Payment Date or the Corporations default in the payment of the distribution.

 



      
 

 



 

3. In case of redemption of less than all of the shares of Series G Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected by the Corporation pro rata from the holders of record of such shares in proportion to the number of shares held by such holders (with adjustments to avoid redemption of fractional shares) or by any other equitable method determined by the Board of Directors. In order to facilitate the redemption of shares of Series G Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of the shares to be redeemed, such record date to be not less than 30 nor more than 90 days prior to the date fixed for such redemption.

 



 

4. Notice of any redemption will be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in The City of New York, such publication to be made once a week for two successive weeks commencing not less than 30 nor more than 90 days prior to the Redemption Date. A similar notice will be mailed by the Corporation, postage prepaid, not less than 30 nor more than 90 days prior to the Redemption Date, addressed to the respective holders of record of the shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be redeemed at their respective addressees as they appear on the share transfer records of the Corporation. No failure to give such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any shares of Series G Preferred Stock except as to any holder to whom the Corporation has failed to give notice or except as to any holder to whom notice was defective. In addition to any information required by law or by the applicable rules of any exchange upon which shares of Series G Preferred Stock may be listed or admitted to trading, such notice shall state: (i) the Redemption Date; (ii) the Redemption Price; (iii) the number of shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares of stock held by the particular holder are to be redeemed, the number of shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be redeemed from such holder; (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price; and (v) that distributions on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the Redemption Date.

 



 

5. If notice has been mailed in accordance with subparagraph (4) of this paragraph (D), and such notice provides that on or before the Redemption Date specified therein all funds necessary for such redemption shall have been set aside by the Corporation, separate and apart from its other funds in trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the shares so called for redemption, so as to be, and to continue to be available therefor, then, from and after the Redemption Date, distributions on the shares of Series G Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, and said shares shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and shall not have the status of shares of Series G Preferred Stock, and all rights of the holders thereof as shareholders of the Corporation(except the right to receive from the Corporation the Redemption Price) shall cease. Upon surrender, in accordance with said notice, of the certificates for any shares so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Corporation shall so require and the notice shall so state), such shares shall be redeemed by the Corporation at the Redemption Price. In case fewer than all the shares evidenced by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate or certificates shall be issued evidencing the unredeemed shares without cost to the holder thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

6. Any funds deposited with a bank or trust company for the purpose of redeeming shares of Series G Preferred Stock shall be irrevocable except that:

 



 

a. the Corporation shall be entitled to receive from such bank or trust
company the interest or other earnings, if any, earned on any money so
deposited in trust, and the holders of any shares redeemed shall have no claim
to such interest or other earnings; and

 



 

b. any balance of monies so deposited by the Corporation and unclaimed by the
holders of the shares of Series G Preferred Stock entitled thereto at the
expiration of two years from the applicable Redemption Date shall be repaid,
together with any interest or other earnings earned thereon, to the
Corporation, and after any such repayment, the holders of the shares entitled
to the funds so repaid to the Corporation shall look only to the Corporation
for payment without interest or other earnings.

 



 

7. No shares of Series G Preferred Stock may be redeemed except with assets legally available for the payment of the Redemption Price.

 



 

8. Unless full cumulative distributions on all Series G Preferred Stock shall have been or contemporaneously are authorized and paid or authorized and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all past Distribution Periods and the then current Distribution Period, no shares of Series G Preferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or acquisition of Series G Preferred Stock pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding Series G Preferred Stock, provided further, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or acquisition of Series G Preferred Stock pursuant to Article NINTH of the Articles of Incorporation and paragraph (F) below. Unless full cumulative distributions on all outstanding Series G Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are authorized and paid or authorized and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all past Distribution Periods and the then current Distribution Period, the Corporation shall not purchase or otherwise acquire directly or indirectly any Series G Preferred Stock (except by conversion into or exchange for stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series G Preferred Stock as to distributions and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation).

 



 

9. All shares of Series G Preferred Stock redeemed pursuant to this paragraph (D) shall be retired and shall be reclassified as authorized and unissued preferred stock, without designation as to class or series, and may thereafter be reissued as any class or series of preferred stock.

 



      
 

 



 

E. _Voting Rights_.

 



 

1. The holders of Series G Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except (i) as provided in paragraph (I) or (ii) as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (E).

 



 

2. In the event the Corporation shall have failed to authorize and pay or set apart for payment in full the distributions accumulated on the outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock for any six or more quarterly Distribution Periods, regardless of whether such quarterly periods are consecutive (a "Preferential Distribution Non-Payment"), the number of directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two and the holders of the outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock, voting together as a class with all other classes or series of preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series G Preferred Stock with respect to distribution rights and then entitled to vote on the election of such additional two directors, shall be entitled to elect such two additional directors until the full distributions accumulated for the past distribution periods and the then current distribution period on all outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock have been authorized and paid or set apart for payment. Upon the occurrence of a Preferential Distribution Non-Payment or a vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (as defined below), the Board of Directors may, and upon the written request of the holders of record of not less than 20% of the holders of the Series G Preferred Stock and all holders of other classes or series of preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series G Preferred Stock with respect to distribution rights who are then entitled to vote on the election of such additional director or directors shall call a special meeting of such holders for the purpose of electing the additional director or directors. In the case of such a written request, such special meeting shall be held within 90 days after the delivery of such request and, in either case, at the place and upon the notice provided by law and in the Bylaws of the Corporation, provided that the Corporation shall not be required to call such a special meeting if such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next ensuing annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation and all holders of the Series G Preferred Stock and stock of any other class or series of preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series G Preferred Stock with respect to distribution rights are afforded the opportunity to elect such additional director or directors (or fill any vacancy) at such annual meeting of shareholders.

 



 

If and when all accumulated distributions on the Series G Preferred Stock have
been authorized and paid or set aside for payment in full, the holders of the
Series G Preferred Stock shall be divested of the special voting rights
provided by this subparagraph (2) of paragraph (E), subject to revesting in
the event of each and every subsequent Preferential Distribution Non-Payment.
Upon termination of such special voting rights attributable to all holders of
the Series G Preferred Stock and shares of any other class or series of
preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series G
Preferred Stock with respect to distribution rights, the term of office of
each director elected by the holders of the Series G Preferred Stock and such
parity preferred stock (a "Preferred Stock Director") pursuant to such special
voting rights shall forthwith terminate and the number of directors
constituting the entire Board of Directors shall be

 



       
 

 



 

reduced by the number of Preferred Stock Directors. Any Preferred Stock
Director may be removed only by the vote of the holders of record of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock and all other
series of preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with the
Series G Preferred Stock with respect to distribution rights who would then be
entitled to vote in such Preferred Stock Directors election, voting together
as a separate class, at a meeting called for such purpose.

 



 

3. So long as any shares of Series G Preferred Stock are outstanding, the number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors of the Corporation shall at all times be such that the exercise, by the holders of the Series G Preferred Stock and the holders of preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series G Preferred Stock with respect to distribution rights, of the right to elect directors under the circumstances provided for in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (E) will not contravene any provision of the Articles of Incorporation restricting the number of directors which may constitute the entire Board of Directors.

 



 

4. Directors elected pursuant to subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (E) shall serve until the earlier of (x) the next annual meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation and the election (by the holders of the Series G Preferred Stock and the holders of preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series G Preferred Stock with respect to distribution rights) and qualification of their respective successors or (y) the termination of the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director upon the termination of the special voting rights as provided for in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (E) or as otherwise provided for in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (E).

 



 

5. So long as a Preferential Distribution Non-Payment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director may be filled by vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock and all other series of preferred stock ranking on a parity with the Series G Preferred Stock with respect to distribution rights who are then entitled to vote in the election of such Preferred Stock Director as provided above. As long as the Preferential Distribution Non-Payment shall continue, holders of the Series G Preferred Stock shall not, as such shareholders, be entitled to vote on the election or removal of directors other than Preferred Stock Directors, but shall not be divested of any other voting rights provided to such shareholders by these Articles of Amendment.

 



 

F. _Board of Directors  Right to Refuse to Transfer Series G Preferred Stock;
Limitation on Holdings_.

 



 

1. The terms and provisions of this paragraph (F) shall apply in addition to, and not in limitation of, the terms and provisions of Article NINTH of the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation.

 



 

2. Each Person who owns directly or indirectly more than 5.0% in number or value of the total shares of Series G Preferred Stock outstanding shall, by January 30 of each year, give written notice to the Corporation stating the Persons name and address, the number of shares of Series G Preferred Stock directly or indirectly owned by such

 



      
 

 



 

Person, and a description of the capacity in which such shares of Series G
Preferred Stock are held. For purposes of these Articles of Amendment, the
number and value of the total shares of Series G Preferred Stock outstanding
shall be determined by the Board of Directors in good faith, which
determination shall be conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In addition,
each direct or indirect holder of Series G Preferred Stock, irrespective of
such shareholders percentage ownership of outstanding shares of Series G
Preferred Stock, shall upon demand disclose to the Corporation in writing such
information with respect to the direct or indirect ownership of Series G
Preferred Stock as the Board of Directors deems necessary from time to time to
enable the Board of Directors to determine whether the Corporation complies
with Sections 856 through 858 of the Code and any successor or other
provisions relating to real estate investment trusts (including provisions as
to the attribution of ownership of beneficial interests therein) and the
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "REIT Provisions of the Code"), to
comply with the requirements of any taxing authority or governmental agency or
to determine any such compliance or to determine any such compliance with this
paragraph (F).

 



 

3. If, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, which shall be binding upon any prospective acquiror of shares of Series G Preferred Stock, any proposed transfer or issuance would jeopardize the status of the Corporation as a REIT under the REIT Provisions of the Code, the Board of Directors shall have the right, but not the duty, to refuse to permit such transfer or issuance or refuse to give effect to such transfer or issuance and to take any action to void any such issuance or cause any such transfer not to occur.

 



 

4. As a condition to any transfer and/or registration of transfer on the books of the Corporation of any shares of Series G Preferred Stock which could result in direct or indirect ownership of Series G Preferred Stock exceeding 9.9% of the lesser of the number or the value of the total shares of Series G Preferred Stock outstanding (the "Series G Excess Preferred Stock") by a Person other than a Series G Preferred Excepted Person (as defined in subparagraph (5) below), such prospective transferee shall give written notice to the Corporation of the proposed transfer and shall furnish such opinions of counsel, affidavits, undertakings, agreements and information as may be required by the Board of Directors no later than the 15th day prior to any transfer which, if consummated, would result in such ownership.

 



 

5. Any transfer or issuance of Series G Preferred Stock that would (i) create a direct or indirect owner of Series G Excess Preferred Stock other than a Series G Preferred Excepted Person (as defined below) or (ii) result in the Corporation being "closely held" within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code, shall be void _ab initio_ and the prospective acquiror shall not be entitled to any rights afforded to owners of Series G Preferred Stock hereunder and shall be deemed never to have had an interest therein.

 



 

"Series G Preferred Excepted Person" shall mean any Person approved by the
Board of Directors, at their option and in their sole discretion, provided,
however, that such approval shall not be granted to any Person whose ownership
of in excess of 9.9% of the lesser of the number or the value of the total
shares of Series G Preferred Stock outstanding would result, directly,
indirectly or as a result of attribution of ownership, in termination of the
status of the Corporation as a REIT under the REIT Provisions of the

 



      
 

 



 

Code.

 



 

6. The Corporation, by notice to the holder thereof which shall be binding upon any proposed transferee of shares of Series G Preferred Stock, may purchase any or all shares of Series G Preferred Stock that are proposed to be transferred pursuant to a transfer which, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, would result in any Person acquiring Series G Excess Preferred Stock, or would otherwise jeopardize the status of the Corporation as a real estate investment trust under the REIT Provisions of the Code. The purchase price for any shares of Series G Excess Preferred Stock to be transferred shall be equal to the fair market value of the shares of Series G Preferred Stock on the last trading day immediately preceding the day on which notice of such proposed transfer is sent, as reflected in the closing sale price for the shares of Series G Preferred Stock, if then listed on a national securities exchange, or such price for the shares of Series G Preferred Stock on the principal exchange if then listed on more than one national securities exchange, or if the shares of Series G Preferred Stock are not then listed on a national securities exchange, the latest bid quotation for the Series G Preferred Stock if then traded over-the-counter, or, if no such closing sales prices or quotations are available, then the purchase price shall be equal to the fair market value of such shares of Series G Preferred Stock as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith. Prompt payment of the purchase price shall be made in cash by the Corporation in such manner as may be determined by the Board of Directors. From and after the date fixed for purchase by the Board of Directors, and so long as payment of the purchase price for the shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be so redeemed shall have been made or duly provided for, the holder of any shares of Series G Excess Preferred Stock so called for purchase shall cease to be entitled to dividends, distributions, voting rights and other benefits with respect to such shares of Series G Preferred Stock, excepting only the right to payment of the purchase price fixed as aforesaid. Any dividend or distribution paid to a proposed transferee of shares of Series G Excess Preferred Stock prior to the discovery by the Corporation that the Series G Preferred Stock have been transferred in violation of this paragraph (F) shall be repaid to the Corporation upon demand. The rights granted to the Corporation in this subparagraph (6) shall not limit the effect of, restrictions in, or rights of the Corporation or the Board of Directors under, any other provision of this paragraph (F).

 



 

7. Notwithstanding any other provision in these Articles of Amendment, the Articles of Incorporation or the Corporations Bylaws, subparagraphs (5), (6), (7) and (8) of this paragraph (F) may not be amended or repealed without the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds of the shares of Series G Preferred Stock then outstanding and entitled to vote. If subparagraph (5), (6), (7) or (8) of this paragraph (F) is determined to be void or invalid by virtue of any legal decision, statute, rule or regulation, then the acquiror of shares of Series G Preferred Stock in violation of such sections shall be deemed, at the option of the Corporation, to have acted as agent on behalf of the Corporation in acquiring such shares of Series G Preferred Stock on behalf of the Corporation.

 



 

8. Subject to subparagraph (12), notwithstanding any other provision of these Articles of Amendment to the contrary, any purported transfer, sale or acquisition of shares of Series G Preferred Stock (whether such purported transfer, sale or acquisition

 



      
 

 



 

results from the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership of Series G
Preferred Stock) which would result in the termination of the status of the
Corporation as a real estate investment trust under the REIT Provisions of the
Code shall be null and void ab initio. Any such shares of Series G Preferred
Stock may be treated by the Board of Directors in the manner prescribed for
Series G Excess Preferred Stock in subparagraph (6) of this paragraph (F).

 



 

9. Subject to subparagraphs (11) and (12), nothing contained in this paragraph (F) or in any other provision of these Articles of Amendment shall limit the authority of the Board of Directors to take such other action as it deems necessary or advisable to protect the Corporation and the interests of the shareholders by preservation of the Corporations status as a real estate investment trust under the REIT Provisions of the Code.

 



 

10. Subject to subparagraph (11), if any provision of this paragraph (F) or any application of any such provision is determined to be invalid by any federal or state court having jurisdiction over the issues, the validity of the remaining provisions shall not be affected and other applications of such provision shall be affected only to the extent necessary to comply with the determination of such court. To the extent this paragraph (F) may be inconsistent with any other provision of these Articles of Amendment, this paragraph (F) shall be controlling.

 



 

11. For purposes of these Articles of Amendment, shares of Series G Preferred Stock not owned directly shall be deemed to be owned indirectly by a person if that person or a group of which he is a member would be the beneficial owner of such shares of Series G Preferred Stock, as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, as amended, and/or would be considered to own such shares of Series G Preferred Stock by reason of the REIT Provisions of the Code.

 



 

12. Notwithstanding any other provision of paragraph (F), nothing in these Articles of Amendment shall preclude the settlement of transactions entered into through the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange. The fact that the settlement of any transaction takes place or occurs shall not negate the effect of any other provision of this paragraph (F) and any transferee in such a transaction shall be subject to all of the provisions and limitations set forth in this paragraph (F).

 



 

G. _Information Rights_.

 



 

During any period in which the Corporation is not subject to Section 13 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act and any shares of Series G Preferred Stock are
outstanding, the Corporation will (i) transmit by mail (or other permissible
means under the Exchange Act) to all holders of Series G Preferred Stock as
their names and addresses appear in the record books of the Corporation and
without cost to such holders, the information required to be delivered
pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
(ii) promptly, upon request, supply copies of such reports to any prospective
beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act)
of Series G Preferred Stock. The Corporation will mail (or otherwise provide)
the information to the holders of Series G Preferred Stock within 15 days
after the respective

 



      
 

 



 

dates by which a periodic report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, as the case may
be, in respect of such information would have been required to be filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission if the Corporation were subject to
Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

 



 

H. _Ranking_.

 



 

With regard to rights to receive distributions and amounts payable upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the Series G
Preferred Stock rank senior to the Common Stock and on a parity with (a) the
Series H Preferred Stock and Series I Preferred Stock in the manner and to the
extent provided herein and (b) any other preferred stock issued by the
Corporation, unless the terms of such other preferred stock provide otherwise
and, if applicable, the requirements of paragraph (I) hereof have been
complied with. However, the Corporation may authorize or increase the
authorized amount of any class or series of stock ranking on a parity with or
junior to the Series G Preferred Stock as to distribution rights or
liquidation preference without the vote or consent of the holders of the
Series G Preferred Stock.

 



 

I. _Limitations_.

 



 

So long as any Series G Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall
not without the affirmative vote, or the written consent, of the holders of at
least two-thirds of the total number of outstanding shares of Series G
Preferred Stock, voting as a class:

 



 

1. authorize, create or issue, or increase the authorized or issued amount of any class or series of, or rights to subscribe to or acquire any security convertible into, any class or series of stock ranking as to distribution rights or liquidation preference senior to the Series G Preferred Stock, or reclassify any shares into any such stock; or

 



 

2. amend, alter or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, any of the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation (including these Articles of Amendment) that would change the preferences, rights or privileges with respect to the Series G Preferred Stock so as to affect the Series G Preferred Stock materially and adversely; but nothing herein contained shall require such a vote or consent (i) in connection with any increase in the total number of authorized shares under the Articles of Incorporation; (ii) in connection with the authorization or increase of any class or series of stock ranking, as to distribution rights and liquidation preference, on a parity with or junior to the Series G Preferred Stock; (iii) in connection with any merger or consolidation in which the Corporation is the surviving entity if, immediately after the merger or consolidation, there are outstanding no shares and no securities convertible into stock ranking as to distribution rights or liquidation preference senior to the Series G Preferred Stock other than the securities of the Corporation outstanding prior to such merger or consolidation; (iv) in connection with any merger or consolidation in which the Corporation is not the surviving entity if, as a result of the merger or consolidation, the holders of Series G Preferred Stock receive shares of stock or other equity securities with preferences, rights and privileges substantially identical to the preferences, rights and privileges of the Series G Preferred Stock and there are outstanding no shares of stock or other equity securities of the surviving entity ranking as to distribution rights or liquidation preference senior to the Series G Preferred Stock other than the securities of the Corporation outstanding prior to

 



      
 

 



 

such merger or consolidation; (v) in connection with any merger or
consolidation in which the holders of the Series G Preferred Stock receive
cash in an amount equal to or greater than the Liquidation Preference per
share plus all distributions accrued and unpaid thereon (whether or not
declared) to the date of such merger or consolidation or (vi) if, at or prior
to the time when the issuance of any such stock ranking senior to the Series G
Preferred Stock is to be made or any such change is to take effect, as the
case may be, the Series G Preferred Stock have been called for redemption upon
proper notice of redemption to occur within 90 days and sufficient funds have
been irrevocably deposited in trust for the redemption of all the then
outstanding Series G Preferred Stock, unless the Redemption Price of the
Series G Preferred Stock (other than any portion thereof consisting of accrued
and unpaid dividends) shall be paid solely from the sale proceeds of such
stock ranking senior to the Series G Preferred Stock.

 



 

J. _Exclusion of Other Rights_.

 



 

The Series G Preferred Stock shall not have any preferences or other rights,
voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other
distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption other than
expressly set forth in the Articles of Incorporation.

 



 

K. _Headings of Subdivisions_.

 



 

The headings of the various subdivisions hereof are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of any of the
provisions.

 



 

L. _Severability of Provisions_.

 



 

If any preferences or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations
as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions
of redemption of the Series G Preferred Stock set forth in the Articles of
Incorporation is invalid, unlawful or incapable of being enforced by reason of
any rule of law or public policy, all other preferences or other rights,
voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications
or terms or conditions of redemption of Series G Preferred Stock set forth in
the Articles of Incorporation which can be given effect without the invalid,
unlawful or unenforceable provision thereof shall, nevertheless, remain in
full force and effect and no preferences or other rights, voting powers,
restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions,
qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption of the Series G Preferred
Stock herein set forth shall be deemed dependent upon any other provision
thereof unless so expressed therein.

 



 

M. _No Preemptive Rights_.

 



 

No holder of Series G Preferred Stock shall be entitled to any preemptive
rights to subscribe for or acquire any unissued stock of the Corporation
(whether now or hereafter authorized) or securities of the Corporation
convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe to or acquire stock of the
Corporation.

 



 

N. _Conversion_.

 



 

The Series G Preferred Stock are not convertible into or exchangeable for any
other property or

 



      
 

 



 

securities of the Corporation.

Such distributions shall be payable quarterly by the Corporation in cash at a rate of 7.5% per annum of the Liquidation Preference (equivalent to $1.875 per share of Series H Preferred Stock per annum) (the "Distribution Rate").

 



 

2. Distributions on Series H Preferred Stock shall accrue and be cumulative at the Distribution Rate from the Original Issue Date or, with respect to shares of Series H Preferred Stock issued after the Original Issue Date, from the Distribution Payment Date (as defined below) immediately preceding the date of issuance thereof. Distributions shall be payable quarterly in arrears when, as and if authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation on the 15th day of January, April, July and October of each year (each, a "Distribution Payment Date"), commencing on [*].(2) If any Distribution Payment Date occurs on a day that is not a Business Day, any accrued distributions otherwise payable on such Distribution Payment Date shall be paid on the next succeeding Business Day.

Distributions in respect of any past Distribution Periods that are in arrears may be declared and paid at any time to holders of record on the Distribution Record Date therefor. Any distribution

  (2) NTD: To insert first quarterly date after date of issuance.

 



      
 

 



 

payment made on Series H Preferred Stock shall be first credited against the
earliest accrued but unpaid distribution due which remains payable. After full
distributions on the Series H Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and
funds set aside for payment for all past distribution periods and for the then
current quarter, the holders of Series H Preferred Stock will not be entitled
to any further distributions with respect to that quarter. The Series H
Preferred Stock shall rank on a parity with the Series I Preferred Stock and
the Series G Preferred Stock, as to distributions in the manner and to the
extent provided herein.

 



 

3. If any shares of Series H Preferred Stock are outstanding, no distributions (other than in Junior Stock) shall be authorized or paid or set apart for payment on any other class or series of Junior Stock or Parity Stock for any period unless full cumulative distributions have been or contemporaneously are authorized and paid or authorized and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment on the Series H Preferred Stock for all past Distribution Periods and the then current Distribution Period. When distributions are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not so set apart) upon the Series H Preferred Stock and any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity as to distributions with the Series H Preferred Stock, all distributions authorized upon the Series H Preferred Stock and any other such class or series of Preferred Stock shall be authorized pro rata so that the amount of distributions authorized per share on the Series H Preferred Stock and such class or series of Stock shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued and unpaid distributions per share on the Series H Preferred Stock and such class or series of Stock bear to each other. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any distribution payment or payments on the Series H Preferred Stock which may be in arrears and holders of Series H Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any distribution, whether payable in cash, property or stock, in excess of full cumulative distributions on the Series H Preferred Stock as provided above.

 



 

4. Unless full cumulative distributions on the Series H Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are authorized and paid or authorized and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all past Distribution Periods and the then current Distribution Period, no Junior Stock or Parity Stock shall be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such stock) by the Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange for other Junior Stock).

 



 

5. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no distributions on Series H Preferred Stock shall be authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or paid or set apart for payment by the Corporation at such time as the terms and provisions of any agreement of the Corporation, including any agreement relating to its indebtedness, prohibits such authorization, payment or setting apart for payment or provides that such authorization, payment or setting apart for payment would constitute a breach thereof or a default thereunder, or to the extent such authorization, payment or setting apart for payment shall be restricted or prohibited by law.

 



      
 

 



 

6. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, distributions on the Series H Preferred Stock, if not paid on the applicable Distribution Payment Date, will accrue without interest whether or not any agreement of the Corporation prohibits payment of such distributions, whether or not distributions are authorized for such Distribution Payment Date, whether or not the Corporation has earnings and whether or not there are assets legally available for the payment of such distributions.

 



 

7. If the Board of Directors determines that it is permissible under applicable law and that the distributions will qualify for the dividends paid deduction (within the meaning of Sections 561 and 562 of the Code or any successor provisions thereto), such distributions shall be paid as follows: first, from income of the Corporation other than net capital gains, and the balance, if any, from net capital gains of the Corporation. If the Board of Directors determines, in its sole discretion, that distributions to be paid in accordance with the preceding sentence might not qualify for such dividends paid deduction, or might not be permissible under applicable law, then such distributions shall be paid in a manner determined by the Board of Directors.

 



 

8. If, for any taxable year, the Corporation elects to designate as "capital gain dividends" (as defined in Section 857 of the Code or any successor revenue code or section) any portion (the "Capital Gains Amount") of the total dividends (as determined for United States federal income tax purposes) paid or made available for such taxable year to holders of all classes and series of Stock (the "Total Distributions"), then the portion of the Capital Gains Amount that shall be allocable to holders of Series H Preferred Stock will be the Capital Gains Amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which will be the total dividends (within the meaning of the Code) paid or made available to the holders of the Series H Preferred Stock for the year and the denominator of which will be the Total Distributions.

 



 

C. _Distributions Upon Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up_.

 



 

1. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, subject to the prior preferences and other rights of any Senior Stock as to liquidation preferences, but before any distribution or payment shall be made to the holders of any Junior Stock as to the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, the holders of Series H Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution to its shareholders liquidating distributions in cash or property at its fair market value as determined by the Board of Directors in the amount of the Liquidation Preference per share plus an amount equal to all distributions accrued and unpaid thereon (whether or not declared) to the date of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the shares of Series H Preferred Stock shall be cancelled and the holders of Series H Preferred Stock will have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation and shall not be entitled to any other distribution in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

2. In the event that, upon any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the legally available assets of the Corporation are insufficient to pay the amount of the Liquidation Preference per share plus an amount equal to all distributions accrued and unpaid on the Series H Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable on all shares of Parity Stock as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, then the holders of the Series H Preferred Stock and all such Parity Stock shall share ratably in any such distribution of assets in proportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they otherwise would be respectively entitled. The Series H Preferred Stock rank on a parity with the Series I Preferred Stock and the Series G Preferred Stock as to the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation. Neither the consolidation or merger of the Corporation into or with another entity nor the dissolution, liquidation, winding up or reorganization of the Corporation immediately followed by incorporation of another corporation to which such assets are distributed, nor the sale, lease, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to another entity shall be deemed a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation within the meaning of this paragraph (C); provided that, in each case, effective provision is made in the articles of incorporation or similar organizational document of the resulting or surviving entity or otherwise for the recognition, preservation and protection of the rights of the holders of the Series H Preferred Stock.

 



 

3. In determining whether a distribution by dividend, redemption or other acquisition of Stock or otherwise is permitted under Indiana law, no effect shall be given to amounts that would be needed, if the Corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights on dissolution are superior to those receiving the distribution.

 



 

D. _Redemption by the Corporation_.

 



 

1. Except as described in this paragraph (D) and paragraph (E) below, shares of Series H Preferred Stock may not be redeemed prior to August 10, 2017. In addition, to ensure that the Corporation remains qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Series H Preferred Stock shall be subject to the provisions of Article NINTH of the Articles of Incorporation and paragraph (G) below. On and after August 10, 2017, the Corporation, at its option (the "Redemption Right"), upon giving notice as provided below, may redeem shares of Series H Preferred Stock, in whole or from time to time in part, for cash, at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions on such Series H Preferred Stock to, but not including, the date of such redemption (the "Redemption Price"). Each date fixed for redemption pursuant to this subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (D) is called a "Redemption Date."

than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, addressed to the
respective holders of record of the Series H Preferred Stock to be redeemed at
their respective addressees as they appear on the share transfer records of
the Corporation. No failure to give such notice or any defect therein or in
the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Series H Preferred Stock except as to any holder to whom the
Corporation has failed to give notice or except as to any holder to whom
notice was defective. In addition to any information required by law or by the
applicable rules of any exchange upon which shares of Series H Preferred Stock
may be listed or admitted to trading, such notice shall state: (i) the
Redemption Date; (ii) the Redemption Price; (iii) the number of shares of

be redeemed will cease to accrue on the Redemption Date.

Upon surrender, in accordance with said notice, of the certificates for any shares so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Corporation shall so require and the notice shall so state), such stock shall be redeemed by the Corporation at the Redemption Price. In case fewer than all the shares evidenced by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate or certificates shall be issued evidencing the unredeemed shares without cost to the holder thereof. In the event that the shares of Series H Preferred Stock to be redeemed are uncertificated, such shares shall be redeemed in accordance with the notice and the applicable procedures of any depository and no further action on the part of the holders of such stock shall be required.

 



 

4. In case of redemption of less than all of the shares of Series H Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected by the Corporation pro rata from the holders of record of such shares in proportion to the number of shares held by such holders (with adjustments to avoid redemption of fractional shares), by lot or by any other equitable method determined by the Board of Directors. In order to facilitate the redemption of shares of Series H Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of the stock to be redeemed, such record date to be not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such redemption.

 



 

5. Unless full cumulative distributions on all Series H Preferred Stock shall have been or contemporaneously are authorized and paid or authorized and a sum sufficient

 



      
 

 



 

for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all past Distribution
Periods and the then current Distribution Period, no Series H Preferred Stock
shall be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series H Preferred Stock
are simultaneously redeemed; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
prevent the purchase or acquisition of Series H Preferred Stock pursuant to a
purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all
outstanding shares of Series H Preferred Stock, provided further, however,
that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or acquisition of Series H
Preferred Stock pursuant to Article NINTH of the Articles of Incorporation and
paragraph (H) below. Unless full cumulative distributions on all outstanding
shares of Series H Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are
authorized and paid or authorized and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof
set apart for payment for all past Distribution Periods and the then current

b. any balance of monies so deposited by the Corporation and unclaimed by the
holders of shares of Series H Preferred Stock entitled thereto at the

In addition to any information required by law or by the applicable rules of any exchange upon which Series H Preferred Stock may be listed or admitted to trading, the notice described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (E) shall state: (i) the Special Optional Redemption Date; (ii) the Special Optional Redemption Price; (iii) the number of shares of Series H Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iv) the place or places where the certificates for shares of Series H Preferred Stock, to the extent Series H Preferred Stock are certificated, are to be surrendered (if so required in the notice) for payment of the Special Optional Redemption Price; (v) that the shares of Series H Preferred Stock are being redeemed pursuant to the Special Optional Redemption Right in connection with the occurrence of a Change of Control and a brief description of the transaction or transactions constituting such Change of Control; (vi) that holders of the shares of Series H Preferred Stock to which the notice relates will not be able to tender such shares of Series H Preferred Stock for conversion in connection with the Change of Control and each share of Series H Preferred Stock tendered for conversion that is selected, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, for redemption will be redeemed on the Special Optional Redemption Date instead of converted on the Change of Control Conversion Date; and (vii) that distributions on Series H Preferred Stock to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the Special Optional Redemption Date. If fewer than all of the shares of Series H Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the number of shares of Series H Preferred Stock held by such holder to be redeemed.

 



 

3. If notice has been mailed in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (E), and such notice provides that on or before the Special Optional Redemption Date specified therein all funds necessary for such redemption shall have been set aside by the Corporation, separate and apart from its other funds in trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the stock so called for redemption, so as to be, and to continue to be available therefor, then, from and after the Special Optional Redemption Date, distributions

be redeemed by the Corporation at the Redemption Price. In case fewer than all
the stock evidenced by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate or
certificates shall be issued evidencing the unredeemed stock without cost to
the holder thereof. In the event that the Series H Preferred Stock to be
redeemed are uncertificated, such stock shall be redeemed in accordance with

company the interest or other earnings, if any, earned on any money so

repaid, together with any interest or other earnings earned thereon, to the
Corporation, and after any such repayment, the holders of the stock entitled
to the funds so repaid to the Corporation shall look only to the Corporation
for payment without interest or other earnings.

exchangeable for any other property or securities of the Corporation, except
as provided in this paragraph (F).

 



 

1. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder of Series H Preferred Stock shall have the right, unless, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided or provides notice of its election to redeem the shares of Series H Preferred Stock pursuant to the Redemption Right or the Special Optional Redemption Right, to convert some or all of the Series H Preferred Stock held by such holder (the "Change of Control Conversion Right") on the Change of Control Conversion Date into a number of Common Stock per share of Series H Preferred Stock to be converted (the "Common Stock Conversion Consideration") equal to the lesser of (A) the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the sum of (x) the Liquidation Preference plus (y) the amount of any accrued and unpaid distributions to, but not including, the Change of Control Conversion Date (unless the Change of Control Conversion Date is after a Distribution Record Date and prior to the corresponding Distribution Payment Date, in which case no additional amount for such accrued and unpaid distribution will be included in such sum) by (ii) the Common Stock Price (as defined below) and (B) [4.9900](3) (the "Share Cap"), subject to the immediately succeeding paragraph.

 



 

The Share Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any share splits
(including those effected pursuant to a Common Share distribution),
subdivisions or combinations (in each case, a "Share Split") with respect to
shares of Common Stock as follows: the adjusted Share Cap as the result of a
Share Split shall be the number of shares of Common Stock that is equivalent
to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the Share Cap in effect immediately
prior to such Share Split by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding after giving effect to such Share
Split and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such Share Split.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence,
the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock (or equivalent Alternative
Conversion Consideration (as defined below), as applicable) issuable in
connection with the exercise of the Change of Control Conversion Right in
respect of the Series H Preferred Stock will not exceed [19,960,000](4) in
total (or equivalent Alternative Conversion Consideration, as applicable) (the
"Exchange Cap"). The Exchange Cap (i) shall be increased on a pro rata basis
with respect to any additional shares of Series H Preferred Stock designated
and authorized for issuance pursuant to any subsequent articles of amendment
and (ii) is subject to pro rata adjustments for any Share Splits on the same
basis as the corresponding adjustment to the Share Cap.

 



 

In the case of a Change of Control pursuant to which Common Stock shall be
converted into cash, securities or other property or assets (including any
combination thereof) (the "Alternative Conversion Consideration"), a holder of
Series H Preferred

  (3) NTD: To be equitably adjusted to be economically equivalent after taking
into account the merger and WPG capitalization.

 

(4) NTD: To be equitably adjusted to be economically equivalent after taking
into account the merger and WPG capitalization.

 



      
 

 



 

Stock shall receive upon conversion of such Series H Preferred Stock the kind
and amount of Alternative Conversion Consideration that such holder of Series
H Preferred Stock would have owned or been entitled to receive upon the Change
of Control had such holder of Series H Preferred Stock held a number of Common
Stock equal to the Common Stock Conversion Consideration immediately prior to
the effective time of the Change of Control (the "Alternative Conversion
Consideration"; and the Common Stock Conversion Consideration or the
Alternative Conversion Consideration, as may be applicable to a Change of
Control, shall be referred to herein as the "Conversion Consideration").

 



 

In the event that holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the
form of consideration to be received in the Change of Control, the
consideration that the holders of Series H Preferred Stock shall receive shall
be the form and proportion of the aggregate consideration elected by the
holders of Common Stock who participate in the determination (based on the
weighted average of elections) and shall be subject to any limitations to
which all holders of Common Stock are subject, including, without limitation,
pro rata reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in
the Change of Control.

 



 

The "Change of Control Conversion Date" shall be a Business Day set forth in
the notice of Change of Control provided in accordance with subparagraph (3)
of this paragraph (F) below that is no less than 20 days nor more than 35 days
after the date on which the Corporation provides such notice pursuant to
subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (F).

 



 

The "Common Stock Price" shall be (i) the amount of cash consideration per
share of Common Stock, if the consideration to be received in the Change of
Control by holders of Common Stock is solely cash, and (ii) the average of the
closing prices per share of Common Stock on the NYSE for the ten consecutive
trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the effective date of
the Change of Control, if the consideration to be received in the Change of
Control by holders Common Stock is other than solely cash.

 



 

2. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Series H Preferred Stock. In lieu of fractional shares, holders shall be entitled to receive the cash value of such fractional shares based on the Common Stock Price.

 



 

3. Within 15 days following the occurrence of a Change of Control, a notice of occurrence of the Change of Control, describing the resulting Change of Control Conversion Right, shall be delivered to the holders of record of Series H Preferred Stock at their addresses as they appear on the Corporations stock transfer records and notice shall be provided to the Corporations transfer agent. No failure to give such notice or any defect thereto or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the conversion of Series H Preferred Stock except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given. Each notice shall state: (i) the events constituting the Change of Control; (ii) the date of the Change of Control; (iii) the last date on which the holders of Series H Preferred Stock may exercise their Change of Control Conversion Right; (iv) the

 



      
 

 



 

method and period for calculating the Common Stock Price; (v) the Change of
Control Conversion Date; (vi) that, if prior to the Change of Control
Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided or provides notice of its
election to redeem all or any portion of Series H Preferred Stock, the holder
will not be able to convert Series H Preferred Stock and such Series H
Preferred Stock shall be redeemed on the related redemption date, even if they
have already been tendered for conversion pursuant to the Change of Control
Conversion Right; (vii) if applicable, the type and amount of Alternative
Conversion Consideration entitled to be received per share of Series H
Preferred Stock; (viii) the name and address of the paying agent and the
conversion agent; and (ix) the procedures that the holders of Series H
Preferred Stock must follow to exercise the Change of Control Conversion
Right.

 



 

4. The Corporation shall issue a press release for publication on the Dow Jones and Company, Inc., Business Wire, PR Newswire or Bloomberg Business News (or, if such organizations are not in existence at the time of issuance of such press release, such other news or press organization as is reasonably calculated to broadly disseminate the relevant information to the public), or post notice on the Corporations website, in any event prior to the opening of business on the first Business Day following any date on which the Corporation provides notice pursuant to subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (F) above to the holders of Series H Preferred Stock.

 



 

5. In order to exercise the Change of Control Conversion Right, a holder of Series H Preferred Stock shall be required to deliver, on or before the close of business on the Change of Control Conversion Date, the certificates evidencing the shares of Series H Preferred Stock, to the extent such shares are certificated, to be converted, duly endorsed for transfer, together with a written conversion notice completed, to the Corporations transfer agent. Such notice shall state: (i) the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date; (ii) the number of shares of Series H Preferred Stock to be converted; and (iii) that the shares of Series H Preferred Stock are to be converted pursuant to the applicable terms of the Series H Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the shares of Series H Preferred Stock are held in global form, such notice shall comply with applicable procedures of DTC.

 



 

6. Holders of Series H Preferred Stock may withdraw any notice of exercise of a Change of Control Conversion Right (in whole or in part) by a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the Corporations transfer agent prior to the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date. The notice of withdrawal must state: (i) the number of withdrawn shares of Series H Preferred Stock; (ii) if certificated shares of Series H Preferred Stock have been issued, the certificate numbers of the withdrawn shares of Series H Preferred Stock; and (iii) the number of shares of Series H Preferred Stock, if any, which remain subject to the conversion notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the shares of Series H Preferred Stock are held in global form, the notice of withdrawal shall comply with applicable procedures of DTC.

 



 

7. Shares of Series H Preferred Stock as to which the Change of Control Conversion Right has been properly exercised and for which the conversion notice has not been properly withdrawn shall be converted into the applicable Conversion Consideration

 



      
 

 



 

in accordance with the Change of Control Conversion Right on the Change of
Control Conversion Date, unless, prior to the Change of Control Conversion
Date, the Corporation has provided or provides notice of its election to
redeem such shares of Series H Preferred Stock, whether pursuant to its
Redemption Right or Special Optional Redemption Right. If the Corporation
elects to redeem shares of Series H Preferred Stock that would otherwise be
converted into the applicable Conversion Consideration on a Change of Control
Conversion Date, such shares of Series H Preferred Stock shall not be so
converted and the holders of such stock shall be entitled to receive on the
applicable redemption date $25.00 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid
distributions thereon to, but not including, the applicable redemption date.

 



 

8. The Corporation shall deliver the applicable Conversion Consideration no later than the third Business Day following the Change of Control Conversion Date.

 



 

9. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no holder of Series H Preferred Stock will be entitled to convert such Series H Preferred Stock into Common Stock to the extent that such conversion would cause such holder (or any other Person) to exceed the share ownership limits contained in the Articles of Incorporation or herein unless the Corporation provides an exemption.

 



 

G. _Voting Rights_.

 



 

1. The holders of Series H Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as provided in this paragraph (G) or as otherwise expressly required by applicable law.

 



 

2. In the event the Corporation shall have failed to authorize and pay or set apart for payment in full the distributions accumulated on the outstanding shares of Series H Preferred Stock for any six or more quarterly Distribution Periods, regardless of whether such quarterly periods are consecutive (a "Preferential Distribution Non-Payment"), the number of directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two and the holders of the outstanding shares of Series H Preferred Stock, voting together as a class with all other classes or series of preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series H Preferred Stock with respect to distribution rights and then entitled to vote on the election of such additional two directors, shall be entitled to elect such two additional directors until the full distributions accumulated for the past distribution periods and the then current distribution period on all outstanding shares of Series H Preferred Stock have been authorized and paid or set apart for payment. Upon the occurrence of a Preferential Distribution Non-Payment or a vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (as defined below), the Board of Directors may, and upon the written request of the holders of record of not less than 20% of the holders of the Series H Preferred Stock and all holders of other classes or series of preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series H Preferred Stock with respect to distribution rights who are then entitled to vote on the election of such additional director or directors shall call a special meeting of such holders for the purpose of electing the additional director or directors. In the case of such a written request, such special meeting shall be held within 90 days after the delivery of such request and, in either case, at the place and

 



      
 

 



 

upon the notice provided by law and in the Bylaws of the Corporation, provided
that the Corporation shall not be required to call such a special meeting if
such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next
ensuing annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation and all holders of
the Series H Preferred Stock and stock of any other class or series of
preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series H
Preferred Stock with respect to distribution rights are afforded the
opportunity to elect such additional director or directors (or fill any
vacancy) at such annual meeting of shareholders.

 



 

If and when all accumulated distributions on the Series H Preferred Stock have
been authorized and paid or set aside for payment in full, the holders of the
Series H Preferred Stock shall be divested of the special voting rights
provided by this subparagraph (2) of paragraph (G), subject to revesting in
the event of each and every subsequent Preferential Distribution Non-Payment.
Upon termination of such special voting rights attributable to all holders of
the Series H Preferred Stock and shares of any other class or series of
preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series H
Preferred Stock with respect to distribution rights, the term of office of
each director elected by the holders of the Series H Preferred Stock and such
parity preferred stock (a "Preferred Stock Director") pursuant to such special
voting rights shall forthwith terminate and the number of directors
constituting the entire Board of Directors shall be reduced by the number of
Preferred Stock Directors. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed only by
the vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Series H Preferred Stock and all other series of preferred stock of the
Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series H Preferred Stock with respect
to distribution rights who would then be entitled to vote in such Preferred
Stock Directors election, voting together as a separate class, at a meeting
called for such purpose.

 



 

3. So long as any shares of Series H Preferred Stock are outstanding, the number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors of the Corporation shall at all times be such that the exercise, by the holders of the Series H Preferred Stock and the holders of preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series H Preferred Stock with respect to distribution rights, of the right to elect directors under the circumstances provided for in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (G) will not contravene any provision of the Articles of Incorporation restricting the number of directors which may constitute the entire Board of Directors.

 



 

4. Directors elected pursuant to subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (G) shall serve until the earlier of (x) the next annual meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation and the election (by the holders of the Series H Preferred Stock and the holders of preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series H Preferred Stock with respect to distribution rights) and qualification of their respective successors or (y) the termination of the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director upon the termination of the special voting rights as provided for in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (G) or as otherwise provided for in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (G).

 



 

5. So long as a Preferential Distribution Non-Payment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director may be filled by vote of the holders of

 



      
 

 



 

record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series H Preferred Stock and
all other series of preferred stock ranking on a parity with the Series H
Preferred Stock with respect to distribution rights who are then entitled to
vote in the election of such Preferred Stock Director as provided above. As
long as the Preferential Distribution Non-Payment shall continue, holders of
the Series H Preferred Stock shall not, as such shareholders, be entitled to
vote on the election or removal of directors other than Preferred Stock
Directors, but shall not be divested of any other voting rights provided to
such shareholders by these Articles of Amendment.

 



 

H. _Board of Directors  Right to Refuse to Transfer Series H Preferred Stock;
Limitation on Holdings_.

 



 

1. The terms and provisions of this paragraph (H) shall apply in addition to, and not in limitation of, the terms and provisions of the Articles of Incorporation applicable to share ownership and transferability of shares, including, but not limited to, Article NINTH.

 



 

2. Each Person who owns directly or indirectly more than 5.0% in number or value of the total shares of Series H Preferred Stock outstanding shall, within 30 days after the end of each taxable year, give written notice to the Corporation stating the Persons name and address, the number of shares of Series H Preferred Stock directly or indirectly owned by such Person, and a description of the manner in which such shares of Series H Preferred Stock are held. For purposes of these Articles of Amendment, the number and value of the total shares of Series H Preferred Stock outstanding shall be determined by the Board of Directors in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In addition, each direct or indirect holder of Series H Preferred Stock, irrespective of such shareholders percentage ownership of outstanding Series H Preferred Stock, shall upon demand disclose to the Corporation in writing such information with respect to the direct or indirect ownership of Series H Preferred Stock as the Board of Directors deems necessary from time to time to enable the Board of Directors to determine whether the Corporation complies with Sections 856 through 858 of the Code and any successor or other provisions relating to real estate investment trusts (including provisions as to the attribution of ownership of beneficial interests therein) and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the "REIT Provisions of the Code"), to comply with the requirements of any taxing authority or governmental authority or to determine any such compliance with this paragraph (H).

 



 

3. If, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, which shall be binding upon any prospective acquiror of shares of Series H Preferred Stock, any proposed transfer or issuance would jeopardize the status of the Corporation as a REIT under the REIT Provisions of the Code, the Board of Directors shall have the right, but not the duty, to refuse to permit such transfer or issuance or refuse to give effect to such transfer or issuance and to take any action to void any such issuance or cause any such transfer not to occur.

 



 

4. Any transfer of shares of Series H Preferred Stock that would result in the shares of Series H Preferred Stock being owned by fewer than 100 persons for purposes of the REIT Provisions of the Code shall be null and void and the prospective acquiror

 



      
 

 



 

shall not be entitled to any rights afforded to owners of Series H Preferred
Stock hereunder and shall be deemed never to have had an interest therein. If
any transfer of shares of Series H Preferred Stock would: (i) create a direct
or indirect owner of Series H Excess Preferred Stock other than a Series H
Preferred Excepted Person (as defined below); (ii) create a direct or indirect
owner of Series H Preferred Stock in excess of 9.8% of the number or value
(whichever is more restrictive) of the total outstanding shares of Series H
Preferred Stock; or (iii) result in the Corporation being "closely held"
within the meaning of Section 856(h), or any successor section, of the Code,
or otherwise cause the Corporation to fail to qualify as a REIT, that number
of shares of Series H Preferred Stock which would cause such violation
(rounded upward to the nearest whole share, such shares so rounded, the
"Excess Stock") shall be deemed to be automatically transferred to a
charitable trust (a "Charitable Trust") or otherwise, shall be deemed to be
void _ab initio_ , to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as
further described in the Articles of Incorporation.

 



 

"Series H Excess Preferred Stock" shall mean ownership of shares of Series H
Preferred Stock exceeding 9.8% of the number or the value (whichever is more
restrictive) of the total shares of Series H Preferred Stock outstanding by a
Person other than a Series H Preferred Excepted Person (as defined below).

 



 

"Series H Preferred Excepted Person" shall mean any Person approved by the
Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee), at their option and in
their sole discretion, provided, however, that such approval shall not be
granted to any Person whose ownership of in excess of 9.8% of the number or
the value (whichever is more restrictive) of the total shares of Series H
Preferred Stock outstanding would result, directly, indirectly or as a result
of attribution of ownership, in termination of the status of the Corporation
as a REIT under the REIT Provisions of the Code.

 



 

5. Notwithstanding subsection (i) of subparagraph (4) above, the Board of Directors may waive or exempt any transfer that results in Series H Excess Preferred Stock if evidence satisfactory to the Board of Directors is presented that such transfer will not then or in the future jeopardize the status of the Corporation as a REIT under the REIT Provisions of the Code. As a condition of a waiver or exemption by the Board of Directors, the intended transferee shall give written notice to the Corporation of the proposed transfer and shall furnish such opinions of counsel, representations, undertakings, agreements and information as may be required by the Board of Directors no later than the 15th day prior to any transfer which, if consummated, would result in such ownership.

 



 

6. Notwithstanding any transfer of Excess Stock to a Charitable Trust, any Excess Stock shall be deemed to have been offered for sale to the Corporation, or its designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that resulted in such shares becoming Excess Stock and (ii) the Market Price (as such term is defined in these Articles of Amendment) of the Series H Preferred Stock on the day the Corporation, or its designee, accepts such offer. If the Corporation exercises its purchase right, prompt payment of the purchase price shall be made in cash by the Corporation in such manner as may be determined by the Board of Directors. From and after

 



      
 

 



 

the date fixed for purchase by the Board of Directors, and so long as payment
of the purchase price for the Series H Preferred Stock to be so redeemed shall
have been made or duly provided for, the holder of any Series H Excess
Preferred Stock so called for purchase shall cease to be entitled to
distributions, voting rights and other benefits with respect to such shares of
Series H Preferred Stock, excepting only the right to payment of the purchase
price fixed as aforesaid. Any dividend or distribution paid to a proposed
transferee of shares of Series H Excess Preferred Stock prior to the discovery
by the Corporation that the Series H Preferred Stock have been transferred in
violation of this paragraph (H) shall be repaid to the Corporation upon
demand. The rights granted to the Corporation in this subparagraph (6) shall
not limit the effect of, restrictions in, or rights of the Corporation or the
Board of Directors under, any other provision of this paragraph (H).

 



 

7. Notwithstanding any other provision in these Articles of Amendment, the Articles of Incorporation or the Corporations Bylaws, subparagraphs (4), (5), (6) and (7) of this paragraph (H) may not be amended or repealed without the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds of the shares of Series H Preferred Stock then outstanding and entitled to vote. If subparagraph (4), (5), (6) or (7) of this paragraph (H) is determined to be void or invalid by virtue of any legal decision, statute, rule or regulation, then the acquiror of shares of Series H Preferred Stock in violation of such sections shall be deemed, at the option of the Corporation, to have acted as agent on behalf of the Corporation in acquiring such shares of Series H Preferred Stock on behalf of the Corporation.

 



 

8. Subject to subparagraph (12), notwithstanding any other provision of these Articles of Amendment to the contrary, any purported transfer, sale or acquisition of shares of Series H Preferred Stock (whether such purported transfer, sale or acquisition results from the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership of Series H Preferred Stock) which would result in the termination of the status of the Corporation as a real estate investment trust under the REIT Provisions of the Code shall be null and void _ab initio_. Any such shares of Series H Preferred Stock may be treated by the Board of Directors in the manner prescribed for Series H Excess Preferred Stock in subparagraph (6) of this paragraph (H).

 



 

9. Subject to subparagraphs (11) and (12), nothing contained in this paragraph (H) or in any other provision of these Articles of Amendment shall limit the authority of the Board of Directors to take such other action as it deems necessary or advisable to protect the Corporation and the interests of the shareholders by preservation of the Corporations status as a real estate investment trust under the REIT Provisions of the Code.

 



 

10. Subject to subparagraph (11), if any provision of this paragraph (H) or any application of any such provision is determined to be invalid by any federal or state court having jurisdiction over the issues, the validity of the remaining provisions shall not be affected and other applications of such provision shall be affected only to the extent necessary to comply with the determination of such court. To the extent this paragraph (H)

 



       
 

 



 

may be inconsistent with any other provision of these Articles of Amendment,
this paragraph (H) shall be controlling.

 



 

11. For purposes of these Articles of Amendment, shares of Series H Preferred Stock not owned directly shall be deemed to be owned indirectly by a Person if that Person or a group of which he is a member would be the beneficial owner of such shares of Series H Preferred Stock, as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act and/or would be considered to own such shares of Series H Preferred Stock by reason of the REIT Provisions of the Code.

 



 

12. Notwithstanding any other provision of paragraph (H), nothing in these Articles of Amendment shall preclude the settlement of transactions entered into through the facilities of the NYSE. The fact that the settlement of any transaction takes place or occurs shall not negate the effect of any other provision of this paragraph (H) and any transferee in such a transaction shall be subject to all of the provisions and limitations set forth in this paragraph (H).

 



 

I. _Information Rights_.

 



 

During any period in which the Corporation is not subject to Section 13 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act and any shares of Series H Preferred Stock are
outstanding, the Corporation will (i) transmit by mail (or other permissible
means under the Exchange Act) to all holders of Series H Preferred Stock as
their names and addresses appear in the record books of the Corporation and
without cost to such holders, the information required to be delivered
pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
(ii) promptly, upon request, supply copies of such reports to any prospective
beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act)
of Series H Preferred Stock. The Corporation will mail (or otherwise provide)
the information to the holders of Series H Preferred Stock within 15 days
after the respective dates by which a periodic report on Form 10-K or Form
10-Q, as the case may be, in respect of such information would have been
required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission if the
Corporation were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

 



 

J. _Ranking_.

 



 

With regard to rights to receive distributions and amounts payable upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the Series H
Preferred Stock rank: (i) senior to the Junior Stock; (ii) on a parity with
the Parity Stock, including the Series I Preferred Stock and the Series G
Preferred Stock, unless the terms of such other preferred stock provide
otherwise and, if applicable, the requirements of paragraph (K) hereof have
been complied with; and (iii) junior to the Senior Stock.

 



 

K. _Limitations_.

 



 

1. So long as any Series H Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall not without the affirmative vote, or the written consent, of the holders of at least two-thirds of the total number of outstanding shares of Series H Preferred Stock and shares of any other class or series of preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series H Preferred Stock, voting as a class:

 



      
 

 



 

a. authorize, create or issue, or increase the authorized or issued amount of
any class or series of, or rights to subscribe to or acquire any security
convertible into, any class or series of stock ranking as to distribution
rights or liquidation preference senior to the Series H Preferred Stock, or
reclassify any shares into any such stock; or

 



 

b. amend, alter or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, any
of the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation (including these Articles
of Amendment) that would change the preferences, rights or privileges with
respect to the Series H Preferred Stock so as to affect the Series H Preferred
Stock materially and adversely; but nothing herein contained shall require
such a vote or consent: (i) in connection with any increase in the total
number of authorized shares under the Articles of Incorporation; (ii) in
connection with the authorization or increase of any class or series of stock
ranking, as to distribution rights and liquidation preference, on a parity
with or junior to the Series H Preferred Stock; (iii) in connection with any
merger or consolidation in which the Corporation is the surviving entity if,
immediately after the merger or consolidation, there are outstanding no shares
and no securities convertible into shares ranking as to distribution rights or
liquidation preference senior to the Series H Preferred Stock other than the
securities of the Corporation outstanding prior to such merger or
consolidation; (iv) in connection with any merger or consolidation in which
the Corporation is not the surviving entity if, as a result of the merger or
consolidation, the holders of Series H Preferred Stock receive shares of stock
or other equity securities with preferences, rights and privileges
substantially identical to the preferences, rights and privileges of the
Series H Preferred Stock and there are outstanding no shares of stock or other
equity securities of the surviving entity ranking as to distribution rights or
liquidation preference senior to the Series H Preferred Stock other than the
securities of the Corporation outstanding prior to such merger or
consolidation; (v) in connection with any merger or consolidation in which the
holders of the Series H Preferred Stock receive cash in an amount equal to or
greater than the Liquidation Preference per share plus all distributions
accrued and unpaid thereon (whether or not declared) to the date of such
merger or consolidation; or (vi) if, at or prior to the time when the issuance
of any such stock ranking senior to the Series H Preferred Stock is to be made
or any such change is to take effect, as the case may be, the Series H
Preferred Stock have been called for redemption upon proper notice of
redemption to occur within 60 days and sufficient funds have been irrevocably
deposited in trust for the redemption of all the then outstanding Series H
Preferred Stock, unless the Redemption Price of the Series H Preferred Stock
(other than any portion thereof consisting of accrued and unpaid
distributions) shall be paid solely from the sale proceeds of such stock
ranking senior to the Series H Preferred Stock.

 



 

2. Notwithstanding Section (K)(1) above, if any amendment, alteration or repeal of the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation (including these Articles of Amendment), whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, would materially and adversely affect any preferences, rights or privileges of the Series H Preferred Stock, but not all of the shares of any other class or series of preferred stock of the Corporation

 



      
 

 



 

ranking on a parity with the Series H Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote,
or the written consent, of the holders of at least two-thirds of the total
number of outstanding Series H Preferred Stock and all such other similarly
affected series or classes, voting as a class, shall be required in lieu of
the affirmative vote or written consent that would otherwise be required by
Section (K)(1).

 



 

L. _Exclusion of Other Rights_.

 



 

The Series H Preferred Stock shall not have any preferences or other rights,
voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other
distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption other than
expressly set forth in the Articles of Incorporation.

 



 

M. _Headings of Subdivisions_.

 



 

The headings of the various subdivisions hereof are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of any of the
provisions.

 



 

N. _Severability of Provisions_.

 



 

If any preferences or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations
as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions
of redemption of the Series H Preferred Stock set forth in the Articles of
Incorporation is invalid, unlawful or incapable of being enforced by reason of
any rule of law or public policy, all other preferences or other rights,
voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications
or terms or conditions of redemption of Series H Preferred Stock set forth in
the Articles of Incorporation which can be given effect without the invalid,
unlawful or unenforceable provision thereof shall, nevertheless, remain in
full force and effect and no preferences or other rights, voting powers,
restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions,
qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption of the Series H Preferred
Stock herein set forth shall be deemed dependent upon any other provision
thereof unless so expressed therein.

 



 

O. _No Preemptive Rights_.

 



 

No holder of Series H Preferred Stock shall be entitled to any preemptive
rights to subscribe for or acquire any unissued stock of the Corporation
(whether now or hereafter authorized) or securities of the Corporation
convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe to or acquire stock of the
Corporation.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

These Articles of Amendment were duly authorized by the Board of Directors of
the Corporation at a meeting duly called and held on [*]. Pursuant to Section

Such distributions shall be payable quarterly by the Corporation in cash at a rate of 6.875% per annum of the Liquidation Preference (equivalent to $1.71875 per share of Series I Preferred Stock per annum) (the "Distribution Rate").

 



 

2. Distributions on Series I Preferred Stock shall accrue and be cumulative at the Distribution Rate from the Original Issue Date or, with respect to shares of Series I Preferred Stock issued after the Original Issue Date, from the Distribution Payment Date (as defined below) immediately preceding the date of issuance thereof. Distributions shall be payable quarterly in arrears when, as and if authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation on the 15th day of January, April, July and October of each year (each, a "Distribution Payment Date"), commencing on [*](2). If any Distribution Payment Date occurs on a day that is not a Business Day, any accrued distributions otherwise payable on such Distribution Payment Date shall be paid on the next succeeding Business Day. Any distribution payable on the Series I Preferred Stock, including for any partial Distribution Period, will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Distributions shall be paid to the holders of record of the Series I Preferred Stock as their names shall appear on the share records of the Corporation at the close of business on the Distribution Record Date for such distribution. Distributions in respect of any past Distribution Periods that are in arrears may be declared and paid at any time to holders of record on the Distribution Record

  (2) NTD: To insert first quarterly date after date of issuance.

 



      
 

 



 

Date therefor. Any distribution payment made on Series I Preferred Stock shall
be first credited against the earliest accrued but unpaid distribution due
which remains payable. After full distributions on the Series I Preferred
Stock have been paid or declared and funds set aside for payment for all past
distribution periods and for the then current quarter, the holders of Series I
Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any further distributions with respect
to that quarter. The Series I Preferred Stock shall rank on a parity with the
Series G Preferred Stock and the Series H Preferred Stock, as to distributions
in the manner and to the extent provided herein.

 



 

3. If any shares of Series I Preferred Stock are outstanding, no distributions (other than in Junior Stock, or as part of the consideration in connection with a redemption, purchase or other acquisition as permitted in subparagraph (4) of paragraph (B) below) shall be authorized or paid or set apart for payment on any other class or series of Junior Stock or Parity Stock for any period unless full cumulative distributions have been or contemporaneously are authorized and paid or authorized and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment on the Series I Preferred Stock for all past Distribution Periods and the then current Distribution Period. When distributions are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not so set apart) upon the Series I Preferred Stock and any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity as to distributions with the Series I Preferred Stock, all distributions authorized upon the Series I Preferred Stock and any other such class or series of Preferred Stock shall be authorized pro rata so that the amount of distributions authorized per share on the Series I Preferred Stock and such class or series of Stock shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued and unpaid distributions per share on the Series I Preferred Stock and such class or series of Stock bear to each other. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any distribution payment or payments on the Series I Preferred Stock which may be in arrears and holders of Series I Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any distribution, whether payable in cash, property or stock, in excess of full cumulative distributions on the Series I Preferred Stock as provided above.

 



 

4. Unless full cumulative distributions on the Series I Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are authorized and paid or authorized and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all past Distribution Periods and the then current Distribution Period, no Junior Stock or Parity Stock shall be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such stock) by the Corporation (except by (i) conversion into or exchange for other Junior Stock or (ii) a purchase of Series I Excess Preferred Stock relating to the Corporations continuing qualification as a REIT (or substantially similar provisions relating to other stock of the Corporations capital stock) or otherwise to ensure the Corporations continued REIT status).

 



 

5. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no distributions on Series I Preferred Stock shall be authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or paid or set apart for payment by the Corporation at such time as the terms and provisions of any agreement of the Corporation, including any agreement relating to its indebtedness, prohibits such authorization, payment or setting apart for

 



      
 

 



 

payment or provides that such authorization, payment or setting apart for
payment would constitute a breach thereof or a default thereunder, or to the
extent such authorization, payment or setting apart for payment shall be
restricted or prohibited by law.

 



 

6. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, distributions on the Series I Preferred Stock, if not paid on the applicable Distribution Payment Date, will accrue without interest whether or not any agreement of the Corporation prohibits payment of such distributions, whether or not distributions are authorized for such Distribution Payment Date, whether or not the Corporation has earnings and whether or not there are assets legally available for the payment of such distributions.

 



 

7. If the Board of Directors determines that it is permissible under applicable law and that the distributions will qualify for the dividends paid deduction (within the meaning of Sections 561 and 562 of the Code or any successor provisions thereto), such distributions shall be paid as follows: first, from income of the Corporation other than net capital gains, and the balance, if any, from net capital gains of the Corporation. If the Board of Directors determines, in its sole discretion, that distributions to be paid in accordance with the preceding sentence might not qualify for such dividends paid deduction, or might not be permissible under applicable law, then such distributions shall be paid in a manner determined by the Board of Directors.

 



 

8. If, for any taxable year, the Corporation elects to designate as "capital gain dividends" (as defined in Section 857 of the Code or any successor revenue code or section) any portion (the "Capital Gains Amount") of the total dividends (as determined for United States federal income tax purposes) paid or made available for such taxable year to holders of all classes and series of Stock (the "Total Distributions"), then the portion of the Capital Gains Amount that shall be allocable to holders of Series I Preferred Stock will be the Capital Gains Amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which will be the total dividends (within the meaning of the Code) paid or made available to the holders of the Series I Preferred Stock for the year and the denominator of which will be the Total Distributions.

 



 

C. _Distributions Upon Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up_.

 



 

1. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, subject to the prior preferences and other rights of any Senior Stock as to liquidation preferences, but before any distribution or payment shall be made to the holders of any Junior Stock as to the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, the holders of Series I Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution to its shareholders liquidating distributions in cash or property at its fair market value as determined by the Board of Directors in the amount of the Liquidation Preference per share plus an amount equal to all distributions accrued and unpaid thereon (whether or not declared) to the date of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the shares of Series I Preferred Stock shall be cancelled and the holders of Series I Preferred Stock will have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of

 



      
 

 



 

the Corporation and shall not be entitled to any other distribution in the
event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the
Corporation.

 



 

2. In the event that, upon any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the legally available assets of the Corporation are insufficient to pay the amount of the Liquidation Preference per share plus an amount equal to all distributions accrued and unpaid on the Series I Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable on all shares of Parity Stock as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, then the holders of the Series I Preferred Stock and all such Parity Stock shall share ratably in any such distribution of assets in proportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they otherwise would be respectively entitled. The Series I Preferred Stock rank on a parity with the Series G Preferred Stock and the Series H Preferred Stock as to the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation. Neither the consolidation or merger of the Corporation into or with another entity nor the dissolution, liquidation, winding up or reorganization of the Corporation immediately followed by incorporation of another corporation to which such assets are distributed, nor the sale, lease, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to another entity shall be deemed a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation within the meaning of this paragraph (C); provided that, in each case, effective provision is made in the articles of incorporation or similar organizational document of the resulting or surviving entity or otherwise for the recognition, preservation and protection of the rights of the holders of the Series I Preferred Stock.

 



 

3. In determining whether a distribution by dividend, redemption or other acquisition of Stock or otherwise is permitted under Indiana law, no effect shall be given to amounts that would be needed, if the Corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights on dissolution are superior to those receiving the distribution.

 



 

D. _Redemption by the Corporation_.

 



 

1. Except as described in this paragraph (D) and paragraph (E) below, shares of Series I Preferred Stock may not be redeemed prior to March 27, 2018. In addition, to ensure that the Corporation remains qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Series I Preferred Stock shall be subject to the provisions of Article NINTH of the Articles of Incorporation and paragraph (G) below. On and after March 27, 2018, the Corporation, at its option (the "Redemption Right"), upon giving notice as provided below, may redeem shares of Series I Preferred Stock, in whole or from time to time in part, for cash, at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions on such Series I Preferred Stock to, but not including, the date of such redemption (the "Redemption Price"). Each date fixed for redemption pursuant to this subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (D) is called a "Redemption Date."

 



 

2. In addition to any information required by law or by the applicable rules of any exchange upon which Series I Preferred Stock may be listed or admitted to trading, notice of any redemption will be given by publication in a newspaper of general

 



      
 

 



 

circulation in The City of New York, such publication to be made once a week
for two successive weeks commencing not less than 30 nor more than 60 days
prior to the Redemption Date. A similar notice will be mailed by the
Corporation, postage prepaid, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to
the Redemption Date, addressed to the respective holders of record of the
Series I Preferred Stock to be redeemed at their respective addressees as they
appear on the share transfer records of the Corporation. No failure to give
such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall affect the
validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any Series I Preferred Stock
except as to any holder to whom the Corporation has failed to give notice or
except as to any holder to whom notice was defective. In addition to any
information required by law or by the applicable rules of any exchange upon
which shares of Series I Preferred Stock may be listed or admitted to trading,
such notice shall state: (i) the Redemption Date; (ii) the Redemption Price;
(iii) the number of shares of Series I Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if
less than all the shares of stock held by the particular holder are to be
redeemed, the number of shares of Series I Preferred Stock to be redeemed from
such holder; (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares, if
any, are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price; and (v) that
distributions on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the
Redemption Date.

 



 

3. If notice has been mailed in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (D), and such notice provides that on or before the Redemption Date specified therein all funds necessary for such redemption shall have been set aside by the Corporation, separate and apart from its other funds in trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the shares so called for redemption, so as to be, and to continue to be available therefor, then, from and after the Redemption Date, distributions on the Series I Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, and said shares shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and shall not have the status of Series I Preferred Stock, and all rights of the holders thereof as shareholders of the Corporation (except the right to receive from the Corporation the Redemption Price) shall cease. Upon surrender, in accordance with said notice, of the certificates for any shares so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Corporation shall so require and the notice shall so state), such stock shall be redeemed by the Corporation at the Redemption Price. In case fewer than all the shares evidenced by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate or certificates shall be issued evidencing the unredeemed shares without cost to the holder thereof. In the event that the shares of Series I Preferred Stock to be redeemed are uncertificated, such shares shall be redeemed in accordance with the notice and the applicable procedures of any depository and no further action on the part of the holders of such stock shall be required.

 



 

4. In case of redemption of less than all of the shares of Series I Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected by the Corporation pro rata from the holders of record of such shares in proportion to the number of shares held by such holders (with adjustments to avoid redemption of fractional shares), by lot or by any other equitable method determined by the Board of Directors. In order to facilitate the redemption of Series I Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of the stock to be redeemed, such

 



      
 

 



 

record date to be not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date
fixed for such redemption.

 



 

5. Unless full cumulative distributions on all Series I Preferred Stock shall have been or contemporaneously are authorized and paid or authorized and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all past Distribution Periods and the then current Distribution Period, no Series I Preferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed, and the Corporation shall not purchase or otherwise acquire directly or indirectly any Series I Preferred Stock except by (i) conversion into or exchange for other Junior Stock, or (ii) a purchase of Series I Excess Preferred Stock relating to the Corporations continuing qualification as a REIT (or substantially similar provisions relating to other stock of the Corporations capital stock) or otherwise to ensure the Corporations continued REIT status; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or acquisition of Series I Preferred Stock pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock, provided further, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or acquisition of Series I Preferred Stock pursuant to Article NINTH of the Articles of Incorporation and paragraph (H) below.

 



 

6. Notwithstanding anything in paragraphs (D), (E) and (H) herein or otherwise, subject to applicable law and the limitation on purchases when distributions on the Series I Preferred Stock are in arrears, the Corporation may, at any time and from time to time, purchase Series I Preferred Stock in the open market, by tender or by private agreement.

 



 

7. Any funds deposited with a bank or trust company for the purpose of redeeming shares of Series I Preferred Stock shall be irrevocable except that:

 



 

a. the Corporation shall be entitled to receive from such bank or trust
company the interest or other earnings, if any, earned on any money so
deposited in trust, and the holders of any shares redeemed shall have no claim
to such interest or other earnings; and

 



 

b. any balance of monies so deposited by the Corporation and unclaimed by the
holders of shares of Series I Preferred Stock entitled thereto at the
expiration of two years from the applicable Redemption Date shall be repaid,
together with any interest or other earnings earned thereon, to the
Corporation, and after any such repayment, the holders of the shares entitled
to the funds so repaid to the Corporation shall look only to the Corporation
for payment without interest or other earnings.

 



 

8. No shares of Series I Preferred Stock may be redeemed except with assets legally available for the payment of the Redemption Price.

 



 

9. All shares of Series I Preferred Stock redeemed pursuant to this paragraph (D) shall be retired and shall be reclassified as authorized and unissued

 



       
 

 



 

preferred stock, without designation as to class or series, and may thereafter
be reissued as any class or series of preferred stock.

 



 

E. _Special Optional Redemption by the Corporation_.

 



 

1. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Corporation will have the option (the "Special Optional Redemption Right") upon written notice mailed by the Corporation, postage pre-paid, no less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Special Optional Redemption Date (as defined below) and addressed to the holders of record of the Series I Preferred Stock to be redeemed at their respective addresses as they appear on the stock transfer records of the Corporation, to redeem the Series I Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, within 120 days after the first date on which such Change of Control occurred, for cash at $25.00 per share plus accrued and unpaid distributions, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date ("Special Optional Redemption Price"). No failure to give such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any Series I Preferred Stock except as to any holder to whom the Corporation has failed to give notice or except as to any holder to whom notice was defective. If, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date (as defined below), the Corporation has provided or provides notice of redemption with respect to the Series I Preferred Stock (whether pursuant to paragraph (D) above or this paragraph (E)), the holders of Series I Preferred Stock will not have the conversion right described below in paragraph (F).

In addition to any information required by law or by the applicable rules of any exchange upon which Series I Preferred Stock may be listed or admitted to trading, the notice described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (E) shall state: (i) the Special Optional Redemption Date; (ii) the Special Optional Redemption Price; (iii) the number of shares of Series I Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iv) the place or places where the certificates for shares of Series I Preferred Stock, to the extent Series I Preferred Stock are certificated, are to be surrendered (if so required in the notice) for payment of the Special Optional Redemption Price; (v) that the shares of Series I Preferred Stock are being redeemed pursuant to the Special Optional Redemption Right in connection with the occurrence of a Change of Control and a brief description of the transaction or transactions constituting such Change of Control; (vi) that holders of the shares of Series I Preferred Stock to which the notice relates will not be able to tender such shares of Series I Preferred Stock for conversion in connection with the Change of Control and each share of Series I Preferred Stock tendered for conversion that is selected, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, for redemption will be redeemed on the Special Optional Redemption Date instead of converted on the Change of Control Conversion Date; and (vii) that distributions on Series I Preferred Stock to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the Special Optional Redemption Date. If fewer than all of the shares of Series I Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the number of shares of Series I Preferred Stock held by such holder to be redeemed.

 



      
 

 



 

3. If notice has been mailed in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (E), and such notice provides that on or before the Special Optional Redemption Date specified therein all funds necessary for such redemption shall have been set aside by the Corporation, separate and apart from its other funds in trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the stock so called for redemption, so as to be, and to continue to be available therefor, then, from and after the Special Optional Redemption Date, distributions on the Series I Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, and said stock shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and shall not have the status of Series I Preferred Stock, and all rights of the holders thereof as shareholders of the Corporation (except the right to receive from the Corporation the Special Optional Redemption Price) shall cease. Upon surrender, in accordance with said notice, of the certificates for any stock so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Corporation shall so require and the notice shall so state), such stock shall be redeemed by the Corporation at the Redemption Price. In case fewer than all the stock evidenced by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate or certificates shall be issued evidencing the unredeemed stock without cost to the holder thereof. In the event that the Series I Preferred Stock to be redeemed are uncertificated, such stock shall be redeemed in accordance with the notice and the applicable procedures of any depository and no further action on the part of the holders of such stock shall be required.

 



 

4. If fewer than all of the outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock are to be redeemed pursuant to the Special Optional Redemption Right, the shares of stock to be redeemed shall be selected by the Corporation pro rata from the holders of record of such shares of stock in proportion to the number of shares of stock held by such holders (with adjustments to avoid redemption of fractional shares of stock), by lot or by any other equitable method determined by the Board of Directors.

 



 

5. Any funds deposited with a bank or trust company for the purpose of redeeming Series I Preferred Stock shall be irrevocable except that:

 



 

a. the Corporation shall be entitled to receive from such bank or trust
company the interest or other earnings, if any, earned on any money so
deposited in trust, and the holders of any stock redeemed shall have no claim
to such interest or other earnings; and

 



 

b. any balance of monies so deposited by the Corporation and unclaimed by the
holders of the Series I Preferred Stock entitled thereto at the expiration of
two years from the applicable Special Optional Redemption Date shall be
repaid, together with any interest or other earnings earned thereon, to the
Corporation, and after any such repayment, the holders of the stock entitled
to the funds so repaid to the Corporation shall look only to the Corporation
for payment without interest or other earnings.

 



 

6. No Series I Preferred Stock may be redeemed except with assets legally available for the payment of the Special Optional Redemption Price.

 



      
 

 



 

7. All Series I Preferred Stock redeemed pursuant to this paragraph (E) shall be retired and shall be reclassified as authorized and unissued preferred stock, without designation as to class or series, and may thereafter be reissued as any class or series of preferred stock.

 



 

F. _Conversion_.

 



 

The shares of Series I Preferred Stock are not convertible into or
exchangeable for any other property or securities of the Corporation, except
as provided in this paragraph (F).

 



 

1. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder of Series I Preferred Stock shall have the right, unless, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided or provides notice of its election to redeem the shares of Series I Preferred Stock pursuant to the Redemption Right or the Special Optional Redemption Right, to convert some or all of the Series I Preferred Stock held by such holder (the "Change of Control Conversion Right") on the Change of Control Conversion Date into a number of Common Stock per share of Series I Preferred Stock to be converted (the "Common Stock Conversion Consideration") equal to the lesser of (A) the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the sum of (x) the Liquidation Preference plus (y) the amount of any accrued and unpaid distributions to, but not including, the Change of Control Conversion Date (unless the Change of Control Conversion Date is after a Distribution Record Date and prior to the corresponding Distribution Payment Date, in which case no additional amount for such accrued and unpaid distribution will be included in such sum) by (ii) the Common Stock Price (as defined below) and (B) [4.3745](3) (the "Share Cap"), subject to the immediately succeeding paragraph.

 



 

The Share Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any share splits
(including those effected pursuant to a Common Share distribution),
subdivisions or combinations (in each case, a "Share Split") with respect to
shares of Common Stock as follows: the adjusted Share Cap as the result of a
Share Split shall be the number of shares of Common Stock that is equivalent
to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the Share Cap in effect immediately
prior to such Share Split by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding after giving effect to such Share
Split and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such Share Split.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence,
the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock (or equivalent Alternative
Conversion Consideration (as defined below), as applicable) issuable in
connection with the exercise of the Change of Control Conversion Right in
respect of the Series I Preferred Stock will not exceed [17,498,000](4) in
total (or equivalent Alternative Conversion Consideration, as applicable) (the
"Exchange Cap"). The Exchange Cap (i) shall be increased on a pro rata basis
with respect to any additional shares of Series I Preferred Stock designated
and

  (3) NTD: To be equitably adjusted to be economically equivalent after taking
into account the merger and WPG capitalization.

 

(4) NTD: To be equitably adjusted to be economically equivalent after taking
into account the merger and WPG capitalization.

 



      
 

 



 

authorized for issuance pursuant to any subsequent articles of amendment and
(ii) is subject to pro rata adjustments for any Share Splits on the same basis
as the corresponding adjustment to the Share Cap.

 



 

In the case of a Change of Control pursuant to which Common Stock shall be
converted into cash, securities or other property or assets (including any
combination thereof) (the "Alternative Conversion Consideration"), a holder of
Series I Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion of such Series I
Preferred Stock the kind and amount of Alternative Conversion Consideration
that such holder of Series I Preferred Stock would have owned or been entitled
to receive upon the Change of Control had such holder of Series I Preferred
Stock held a number of Common Stock equal to the Common Stock Conversion
Consideration immediately prior to the effective time of the Change of Control
(the "Alternative Conversion Consideration"; and the Common Stock Conversion
Consideration or the Alternative Conversion Consideration, as may be
applicable to a Change of Control, shall be referred to herein as the
"Conversion Consideration").

 



 

In the event that holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the
form of consideration to be received in the Change of Control, the
consideration that the holders of Series I Preferred Stock shall receive shall
be the form and proportion of the aggregate consideration elected by the
holders of Common Stock who participate in the determination (based on the
weighted average of elections) and shall be subject to any limitations to
which all holders of Common Stock are subject, including, without limitation,
pro rata reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in
the Change of Control.

 



 

The "Change of Control Conversion Date" shall be a Business Day set forth in
the notice of Change of Control provided in accordance with subparagraph (3)
of this paragraph (F) below that is no less than 20 days nor more than 35 days
after the date on which the Corporation provides such notice pursuant to
subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (F).

 



 

The "Common Stock Price" shall be (i) the amount of cash consideration per
share of Common Stock, if the consideration to be received in the Change of
Control by holders of Common Stock is solely cash, and (ii) the average of the
closing prices per share of Common Stock on the NYSE for the ten consecutive
trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the effective date of
the Change of Control, if the consideration to be received in the Change of
Control by holders Common Stock is other than solely cash.

 



 

2. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Series I Preferred Stock. In lieu of fractional shares, holders shall be entitled to receive the cash value of such fractional shares based on the Common Stock Price.

 



 

3. Within 15 days following the occurrence of a Change of Control, a notice of occurrence of the Change of Control, describing the resulting Change of Control 

 



      
 

 



 

Conversion Right, shall be delivered to the holders of record of Series I
Preferred Stock at their addresses as they appear on the Corporations stock
transfer records and notice shall be provided to the Corporations transfer
agent. No failure to give such notice or any defect thereto or in the mailing
thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the conversion of
Series I Preferred Stock except as to the holder to whom notice was defective
or not given. Each notice shall state: (i) the events constituting the Change
of Control; (ii) the date of the Change of Control; (iii) the last date on
which the holders of Series I Preferred Stock may exercise their Change of
Control Conversion Right; (iv) the method and period for calculating the
Common Stock Price; (v) the Change of Control Conversion Date; (vi) that, if
prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided
or provides notice of its election to redeem all or any portion of Series I
Preferred Stock, the holder will not be able to convert Series I Preferred
Stock and such Series I Preferred Stock shall be redeemed on the related
redemption date, even if they have already been tendered for conversion
pursuant to the Change of Control Conversion Right; (vii) if applicable, the
type and amount of Alternative Conversion Consideration entitled to be
received per share of Series I Preferred Stock; (viii) the name and address of
the paying agent and the conversion agent; and (ix) the procedures that the
holders of Series I Preferred Stock must follow to exercise the Change of
Control Conversion Right.

 



 

4. The Corporation shall issue a press release for publication on the Dow Jones and Company, Inc., Business Wire, PR Newswire or Bloomberg Business News (or, if such organizations are not in existence at the time of issuance of such press release, such other news or press organization as is reasonably calculated to broadly disseminate the relevant information to the public), or post notice on the Corporations website, in any event prior to the opening of business on the first Business Day following any date on which the Corporation provides notice pursuant to subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (F) above to the holders of Series I Preferred Stock.

 



 

5. In order to exercise the Change of Control Conversion Right, a holder of Series I Preferred Stock shall be required to deliver, on or before the close of business on the Change of Control Conversion Date, the certificates evidencing the shares of Series I Preferred Stock, to the extent such shares are certificated, to be converted, duly endorsed for transfer, together with a written conversion notice completed, to the Corporations transfer agent. Such notice shall state: (i) the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date; (ii) the number of shares of Series I Preferred Stock to be converted; and (iii) that the shares of Series I Preferred Stock are to be converted pursuant to the applicable terms of the Series I Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the shares of Series I Preferred Stock are held in global form, such notice shall comply with applicable procedures of DTC.

 



 

6. Holders of Series I Preferred Stock may withdraw any notice of exercise of a Change of Control Conversion Right (in whole or in part) by a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the Corporations transfer agent prior to the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date. The notice of withdrawal must state: (i) the number of withdrawn shares of Series I Preferred Stock; (ii) if certificated shares of Series I Preferred Stock have been issued, the certificate 

 



      
 

 



 

numbers of the withdrawn shares of Series I Preferred Stock; and (iii) the
number of shares of Series I Preferred Stock, if any, which remain subject to
the conversion notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the shares of Series
I Preferred Stock are held in global form, the notice of withdrawal shall
comply with applicable procedures of DTC.

 



 

7. Shares of Series I Preferred Stock as to which the Change of Control Conversion Right has been properly exercised and for which the conversion notice has not been properly withdrawn shall be converted into the applicable Conversion Consideration in accordance with the Change of Control Conversion Right on the Change of Control Conversion Date, unless, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided or provides notice of its election to redeem such shares of Series I Preferred Stock, whether pursuant to its Redemption Right or Special Optional Redemption Right. If the Corporation elects to redeem shares of Series I Preferred Stock that would otherwise be converted into the applicable Conversion Consideration on a Change of Control Conversion Date, such shares of Series I Preferred Stock shall not be so converted and the holders of such stock shall be entitled to receive on the applicable redemption date $25.00 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid distributions thereon to, but not including, the applicable redemption date.

 



 

8. The Corporation shall deliver the applicable Conversion Consideration no later than the third Business Day following the Change of Control Conversion Date.

 



 

9. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no holder of Series I Preferred Stock will be entitled to convert such Series I Preferred Stock into Common Stock to the extent that such conversion would cause such holder (or any other Person) to exceed the share ownership limits contained in the Articles of Incorporation or herein unless the Corporation provides an exemption.

 



 

G. _Voting Rights_.

 



 

1. The holders of Series I Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as provided in this paragraph (G) or as otherwise expressly required by applicable law or the rules of the NYSE or any other securities exchange or quotation system on which the Series I Preferred Stock are then listed, traded or quoted.

 



 

2. In the event the Corporation shall have failed to authorize and pay or set apart for payment in full the distributions accumulated on the outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock for any six or more quarterly Distribution Periods, regardless of whether such quarterly periods are consecutive (a "Preferential Distribution Non-Payment"), the number of directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two and the holders of the outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock, voting together as a class with all other classes or series of preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series I Preferred Stock with respect to distribution rights and then entitled to vote on the election of such additional two directors, shall be entitled to elect such two additional directors until the full distributions accumulated for the past distribution periods and the then current distribution period on all outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock have been authorized and paid or set apart for payment. Upon the 

 



      
 

 



 

occurrence of a Preferential Distribution Non-Payment or a vacancy in the
office of a Preferred Stock Director (as defined below), the Board of
Directors may, and upon the written request of the holders of record of not
less than 20% of the holders of the Series I Preferred Stock and all holders
of other classes or series of preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a
parity with the Series I Preferred Stock with respect to distribution rights
who are then entitled to vote on the election of such additional director or
directors shall call a special meeting of such holders for the purpose of
electing the additional director or directors. In the case of such a written
request, such special meeting shall be held within 90 days after the delivery
of such request and, in either case, at the place and upon the notice provided
by law and in the Bylaws of the Corporation, provided that the Corporation
shall not be required to call such a special meeting if such request is
received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next ensuing annual
meeting of shareholders of the Corporation and all holders of the Series I
Preferred Stock and stock of any other class or series of preferred stock of
the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series I Preferred Stock with
respect to distribution rights are afforded the opportunity to elect such
additional director or directors (or fill any vacancy) at such annual meeting
of shareholders.

 



 

If and when all accumulated distributions on the Series I Preferred Stock have
been authorized and paid or set aside for payment in full, the holders of the
Series I Preferred Stock shall be divested of the special voting rights
provided by this subparagraph (2) of paragraph (G), subject to revesting in
the event of each and every subsequent Preferential Distribution Non-Payment.
Upon termination of such special voting rights attributable to all holders of
the Series I Preferred Stock and shares of any other class or series of
preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series I
Preferred Stock with respect to distribution rights, the term of office of
each director elected by the holders of the Series I Preferred Stock and such
parity preferred stock (a "Preferred Stock Director") pursuant to such special
voting rights shall forthwith terminate and the number of directors
constituting the entire Board of Directors shall be reduced by the number of
Preferred Stock Directors. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed only by
the vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Series I Preferred Stock and all other series of preferred stock of the
Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series I Preferred Stock with respect
to distribution rights who would then be entitled to vote in such Preferred
Stock Directors election, voting together as a separate class, at a meeting
called for such purpose.

 



 

3. So long as any shares of Series I Preferred Stock are outstanding, the number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors of the Corporation shall at all times be such that the exercise, by the holders of the Series I Preferred Stock and the holders of preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series I Preferred Stock with respect to distribution rights, of the right to elect directors under the circumstances provided for in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (G) will not contravene any provision of the Articles of Incorporation restricting the number of directors which may constitute the entire Board of Directors.

 



 

4. Directors elected pursuant to subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (G) shall serve until the earlier of (x) the next annual meeting of the shareholders of the 

 



      
 

 



 

Corporation and the election (by the holders of the Series I Preferred Stock
and the holders of preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with
the Series I Preferred Stock with respect to distribution rights) and
qualification of their respective successors or (y) the termination of the
term of office of each Preferred Stock Director upon the termination of the
special voting rights as provided for in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph
(G) or as otherwise provided for in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (G).

 



 

5. So long as a Preferential Distribution Non-Payment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director may be filled by vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock and all other series of preferred stock ranking on a parity with the Series I Preferred Stock with respect to distribution rights who are then entitled to vote in the election of such Preferred Stock Director as provided above. As long as the Preferential Distribution Non-Payment shall continue, holders of the Series I Preferred Stock shall not, as such shareholders, be entitled to vote on the election or removal of directors other than Preferred Stock Directors, but shall not be divested of any other voting rights provided to such shareholders by these Articles of Amendment.

 



 

H. _Board of Directors  Right to Refuse to Transfer Series I Preferred Stock;
Limitation on Holdings_.

 



 

1. The terms and provisions of this paragraph (H) shall apply in addition to, and not in limitation of, the terms and provisions of the Articles of Incorporation applicable to share ownership and transferability of shares, including, but not limited to, Article NINTH.

 



 

2. Each Person who owns directly or indirectly more than 5.0% in number or value of the total shares of Series I Preferred Stock outstanding shall, within 30 days after the end of each taxable year, give written notice to the Corporation stating the Persons name and address, the number of shares of Series I Preferred Stock directly or indirectly owned by such Person, and a description of the manner in which such shares of Series I Preferred Stock are held. For purposes of these Articles of Amendment, the number and value of the total shares of Series I Preferred Stock outstanding shall be determined by the Board of Directors in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In addition, each direct or indirect holder of Series I Preferred Stock, irrespective of such shareholders percentage ownership of outstanding Series I Preferred Stock, shall upon demand disclose to the Corporation in writing such information with respect to the direct or indirect ownership of Series I Preferred Stock as the Board of Directors deems necessary from time to time to enable the Board of Directors to determine whether the Corporation complies with Sections 856 through 858 of the Code and any successor or other provisions relating to real estate investment trusts (including provisions as to the attribution of ownership of beneficial interests therein) and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the "REIT Provisions of the Code"), to comply with the requirements of any taxing authority or governmental authority or to determine any such compliance with this paragraph (H).

 



      
 

 



 

3. If, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, which shall be binding upon any prospective acquiror of shares of Series I Preferred Stock, any proposed transfer or issuance would jeopardize the status of the Corporation as a REIT under the REIT Provisions of the Code, the Board of Directors shall have the right, but not the duty, to refuse to permit such transfer or issuance or refuse to give effect to such transfer or issuance and to take any action to void any such issuance or cause any such transfer not to occur.

 



 

4. Any transfer of shares of Series I Preferred Stock that would result in the shares of Series I Preferred Stock being owned by fewer than 100 persons for purposes of the REIT Provisions of the Code shall be null and void and the prospective acquiror shall not be entitled to any rights afforded to owners of Series I Preferred Stock hereunder and shall be deemed never to have had an interest therein. If any transfer of shares of Series I Preferred Stock would: (i) create a direct or indirect owner of Series I Excess Preferred Stock other than a Series I Preferred Excepted Person (as defined below); (ii) create a direct or indirect owner of Series I Preferred Stock in excess of 9.8% of the number or value (whichever is more restrictive) of the total outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock; or (iii) result in the Corporation being "closely held" within the meaning of Section 856(h), or any successor section, of the Code, or otherwise cause the Corporation to fail to qualify as a REIT, that number of shares of Series I Preferred Stock which would cause such violation (rounded upward to the nearest whole share, such shares so rounded, the "Excess Stock") shall be deemed to be automatically transferred to a charitable trust (a "Charitable Trust") or otherwise, shall be deemed to be void _ab initio_ , to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as further described in the Articles of Incorporation.

 



 

"Series I Excess Preferred Stock" shall mean ownership of shares of Series I
Preferred Stock exceeding 9.8% of the number or the value (whichever is more
restrictive) of the total shares of Series I Preferred Stock outstanding by a
Person other than a Series I Preferred Excepted Person (as defined below).

 



 

"Series I Preferred Excepted Person" shall mean any Person approved by the
Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee), at their option and in
their sole discretion, provided, however, that such approval shall not be
granted to any Person whose ownership of in excess of 9.8% of the number or
the value (whichever is more restrictive) of the total shares of Series I
Preferred Stock outstanding would result, directly, indirectly or as a result
of attribution of ownership, in termination of the status of the Corporation
as a REIT under the REIT Provisions of the Code.

 



 

5. Notwithstanding subsection (i) of subparagraph (4) above, the Board of Directors may waive or exempt any transfer that results in Series I Excess Preferred Stock if evidence satisfactory to the Board of Directors is presented that such transfer will not then or in the future jeopardize the status of the Corporation as a REIT under the REIT Provisions of the Code. As a condition of a waiver or exemption by the Board of Directors, the intended transferee shall give written notice to the Corporation of the proposed transfer and shall furnish such opinions of counsel, representations, undertakings, agreements and information as may be required by the Board of Directors 

 



      
 

 



 

no later than the 15th day prior to any transfer which, if consummated, would
result in such ownership.

 



 

6. Notwithstanding any transfer of Excess Stock to a Charitable Trust, any Excess Stock shall be deemed to have been offered for sale to the Corporation, or its designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that resulted in such shares becoming Excess Stock and (ii) the Market Price (as such term is defined in these Articles of Amendment) of the Series I Preferred Stock on the day the Corporation, or its designee, accepts such offer. If the Corporation exercises its purchase right, prompt payment of the purchase price shall be made in cash by the Corporation in such manner as may be determined by the Board of Directors. From and after the date fixed for purchase by the Board of Directors, and so long as payment of the purchase price for the Series I Preferred Stock to be so redeemed shall have been made or duly provided for, the holder of any Series I Excess Preferred Stock so called for purchase shall cease to be entitled to distributions, voting rights and other benefits with respect to such shares of Series I Preferred Stock, excepting only the right to payment of the purchase price fixed as aforesaid. Any dividend or distribution paid to a proposed transferee of shares of Series I Excess Preferred Stock prior to the discovery by the Corporation that the Series I Preferred Stock have been transferred in violation of this paragraph (H) shall be repaid to the Corporation upon demand. The rights granted to the Corporation in this subparagraph (6) shall not limit the effect of, restrictions in, or rights of the Corporation or the Board of Directors under, any other provision of this paragraph (H).

 



 

7. Notwithstanding any other provision in these Articles of Amendment, the Articles of Incorporation or the Corporations Bylaws, subparagraphs (4), (5), (6) and (7) of this paragraph (H) may not be amended or repealed without the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds of the shares of Series I Preferred Stock then outstanding and entitled to vote. If subparagraph (4), (5), (6) or (7) of this paragraph (H) is determined to be void or invalid by virtue of any legal decision, statute, rule or regulation, then the acquiror of shares of Series I Preferred Stock in violation of such sections shall be deemed, at the option of the Corporation, to have acted as agent on behalf of the Corporation in acquiring such shares of Series I Preferred Stock on behalf of the Corporation.

 



 

8. Subject to subparagraph (12), notwithstanding any other provision of these Articles of Amendment to the contrary, any purported transfer, sale or acquisition of shares of Series I Preferred Stock (whether such purported transfer, sale or acquisition results from the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership of Series I Preferred Stock) which would result in the termination of the status of the Corporation as a real estate investment trust under the REIT Provisions of the Code shall be null and void ab initio. Any such shares of Series I Preferred Stock may be treated by the Board of Directors in the manner prescribed for Series I Excess Preferred Stock in subparagraph (6) of this paragraph (H).

 



 

9. Subject to subparagraphs (11) and (12), nothing contained in this paragraph (H) or in any other provision of these Articles of Amendment shall limit the

 



       
 

 



 

authority of the Board of Directors to take such other action as it deems
necessary or advisable to protect the Corporation and the interests of the
shareholders by preservation of the Corporations status as a real estate
investment trust under the REIT Provisions of the Code.

 



 

10. Subject to subparagraph (11), if any provision of this paragraph (H) or any application of any such provision is determined to be invalid by any federal or state court having jurisdiction over the issues, the validity of the remaining provisions shall not be affected and other applications of such provision shall be affected only to the extent necessary to comply with the determination of such court. To the extent this paragraph (H) may be inconsistent with any other provision of these Articles of Amendment, this paragraph (H) shall be controlling.

 



 

11. For purposes of these Articles of Amendment, shares of Series I Preferred Stock not owned directly shall be deemed to be owned indirectly by a Person if that Person or a group of which he is a member would be the beneficial owner of such shares of Series I Preferred Stock, as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act and/or would be considered to own such shares of Series I Preferred Stock by reason of the REIT Provisions of the Code.

 



 

12. Notwithstanding any other provision of paragraph (H), nothing in these Articles of Amendment shall preclude the settlement of transactions entered into through the facilities of the NYSE. The fact that the settlement of any transaction takes place or occurs shall not negate the effect of any other provision of this paragraph (H) and any transferee in such a transaction shall be subject to all of the provisions and limitations set forth in this paragraph (H).

 



 

I. _Information Rights_.

 



 

During any period in which the Corporation is not subject to Section 13 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act and any shares of Series I Preferred Stock are
outstanding, the Corporation will (i) transmit by mail (or other permissible
means under the Exchange Act) to all holders of Series I Preferred Stock as
their names and addresses appear in the record books of the Corporation and
without cost to such holders, copies of the annual reports on Form 10-K and
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q that the Corporation would have been required
to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act if
the Corporation were subject thereto (other than any exhibits, including
certifications, that would have been required), and (ii) promptly, upon
request, supply copies of such reports to any prospective beneficial owner (as
defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) of Series I Preferred
Stock. The Corporation will mail (or otherwise provide) the information to the
holders of Series I Preferred Stock within 15 days after the respective dates
by which a periodic report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, as the case may be, in
respect of such information would have been required to be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission if the Corporation were subject to Section
13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

 



      
 

 



 

J. _Ranking_.

 



 

With regard to rights to receive distributions and amounts payable upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the Series I
Preferred Stock rank: (i) senior to the Junior Stock; (ii) on a parity with
the Parity Stock, including the Series G Preferred Stock and the Series H
Preferred Stock, unless the terms of such other preferred stock provide
otherwise and, if applicable, the requirements of paragraph (K) hereof have
been complied with; and (iii) junior to the Senior Stock.

 



 

K. _Limitations_.

 



 

1. So long as any Series I Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall not without the affirmative vote, or the written consent, of the holders of at least two-thirds of the total number of outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock and shares of any other class or series of preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series I Preferred Stock, voting as a class:

 



 

a. authorize, create or issue, or increase the authorized or issued amount of
any class or series of, or rights to subscribe to or acquire any security
convertible into, any class or series of stock ranking as to distribution
rights or liquidation preference senior to the Series I Preferred Stock, or
reclassify any shares into any such stock; or

 



 

b. amend, alter or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, any
of the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation (including these Articles
of Amendment) that would change the preferences, rights or privileges with
respect to the Series I Preferred Stock so as to affect the Series I Preferred
Stock materially and adversely; but nothing herein contained shall require
such a vote or consent: (i) in connection with any increase in the total
number of authorized shares under the Articles of Incorporation; (ii) in
connection with the authorization or increase of any class or series of stock
ranking, as to distribution rights and liquidation preference, on a parity

consolidation, the holders of Series I Preferred Stock receive shares of stock
or other equity securities with preferences, rights and privileges
substantially identical to the preferences, rights and privileges of the
Series I Preferred Stock and there are outstanding no shares of stock or other
equity securities of the surviving entity ranking as to distribution rights or
liquidation preference senior to the Series I Preferred Stock other than the
securities of the Corporation outstanding prior to such merger or
consolidation; (v) in connection with any merger or consolidation in which the
holders of the Series I Preferred Stock receive cash in an amount equal to or
greater than the Liquidation Preference per share plus all distributions
accrued and unpaid thereon (whether or

 



      
 

 



 

not declared) to the date of such merger or consolidation; or (vi) if, at or
prior to the time when the issuance of any such stock ranking senior to the
Series I Preferred Stock is to be made or any such change is to take effect,
as the case may be, the Series I Preferred Stock have been called for
redemption upon proper notice of redemption to occur within 60 days and
sufficient funds have been irrevocably deposited in trust for the redemption
of all the then outstanding Series I Preferred Stock, unless the Redemption
Price of the Series I Preferred Stock (other than any portion thereof
consisting of accrued and unpaid distributions) shall be paid solely from the
sale proceeds of such stock ranking senior to the Series I Preferred Stock.

 



 

2. Notwithstanding Section (K)(1) above, if any amendment, alteration or repeal of the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation (including these Articles of Amendment), whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, would materially and adversely affect any preferences, rights or privileges of the Series I Preferred Stock, but not all of the shares of any other class or series of preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series I Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote, or the written consent, of the holders of at least two-thirds of the total number of outstanding Series I Preferred Stock and all such other similarly affected series or classes, voting as a class, shall be required in lieu of the affirmative vote or written consent that would otherwise be required by Section (K)(1).

 



 

L. _Exclusion of Other Rights_.

voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other
distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption other than
expressly set forth in the Articles of Incorporation.

 



 

M. _Headings of Subdivisions_.

 



 

The headings of the various subdivisions hereof are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of any of the

If any preferences or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations
as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions
of redemption of the Series I Preferred Stock set forth in the Articles of

any rule of law or public policy, all other preferences or other rights,
voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications
or terms or conditions of redemption of Series I Preferred Stock set forth in
the Articles of Incorporation which can be given effect without the invalid,
unlawful or unenforceable provision thereof shall, nevertheless, remain in
full force and effect and no preferences or other rights, voting powers,
restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions,
qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption of the Series I Preferred
Stock herein set forth shall be deemed dependent upon any other provision
thereof unless so expressed therein.

 



      
 

 



 

O. _No Preemptive Rights_.

 



 

No holder of Series I Preferred Stock shall be entitled to any preemptive
rights to subscribe for or acquire any unissued stock of the Corporation
