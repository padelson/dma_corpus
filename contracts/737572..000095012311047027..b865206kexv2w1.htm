 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, New Alkermes shall engage Computershare or another institution satisfactory to Alkermes (acting in its sole discretion) to act as exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time, New Alkermes shall issue to the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Alkermes Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, certificates representing the New Alkermes Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to _Section 2.9(a)_ (or appropriate alternative arrangements satisfactory to Alkermes (acting in its sole discretion) shall be made by New Alkermes if uncertificated New Alkermes Ordinary Shares will be issued). In addition, New Alkermes shall make available by depositing with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after the Effective Time, cash in an amount sufficient to make the payments in respect of any dividends or distributions to which holders of shares of New Alkermes Ordinary Shares may be entitled pursuant to _Section 2.10(c)_. All cash and certificates representing New Alkermes Ordinary Shares deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Time, New Alkermes shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Alkermes Common Stock (the " _Alkermes Certificates_ "), which at the Effective Time were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.9_, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and that risk of loss and title to the Alkermes Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Alkermes Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to New Alkermes and Alkermes) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Alkermes Certificates in exchange for New Alkermes Ordinary Shares and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.10(c)_. Upon surrender of Alkermes Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Alkermes Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor that number of New Alkermes Ordinary Shares (after taking into account all Alkermes Certificates surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section 2.9_ (which shall be in uncertificated form) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.10(c)_, and the Alkermes Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Alkermes Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of Alkermes, the proper number of New Alkermes Ordinary Shares in form may be transferred to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Alkermes Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Alkermes Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such transfer shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of New 

      ##### 

  

    

Alkermes Ordinary Shares to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Alkermes Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of New
Alkermes that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 2.10(a)_, each Alkermes Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration upon such surrender. No interest shall be
paid or shall accrue on any amount payable pursuant to _Section 2.10(c)_. 

   

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to New Alkermes Ordinary Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Alkermes Certificate with respect to the New Alkermes Ordinary Shares represented thereby until such Alkermes Certificate has been surrendered in accordance with this _Section 2.10_. Subject to applicable Law and the provisions of this  _Section 2.10_, following surrender of any such Alkermes Certificate, there shall be transferred or paid to the recordholder thereof by the Exchange Agent, without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender, the number of New Alkermes Ordinary Shares transferrable in exchange therefor pursuant to this _Section 2.10_ and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole New Alkermes Ordinary Shares and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such New Alkermes Ordinary Shares.

applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_.

 (h) _Withholding Rights_. New Alkermes and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person who was a holder of Alkermes Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time such amounts as New Alkermes or the Exchange Agent may be required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by New Alkermes or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid. 

   

 (i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Alkermes Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Alkermes Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such New Alkermes Ordinary Shares as may be required pursuant to _Section 2.9(a)_ and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.10(c)_;  _provided_ , that New Alkermes may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Alkermes Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification in a form reasonably satisfactory to New Alkermes, or a bond in such sum as New Alkermes may reasonably direct as indemnity, against any claim that may be made against New Alkermes or the Exchange Agent in respect of the Alkermes Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(a) Each Alkermes Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted at the Effective Time into an option to acquire, on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Alkermes Option, the number of New Alkermes Ordinary Shares, determined by multiplying the number of shares of Alkermes Common Stock subject to such Alkermes Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per New Alkermes Ordinary Share equal to (A) the exercise price per share of Alkermes Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Alkermes Option divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio; and 

   

 (b) Each Alkermes Stock Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted at the Effective Time into a right to receive, on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Alkermes Stock Award, the 

      ##### 

  

    

number of New Alkermes Ordinary Shares, determined by multiplying the number
of shares of Alkermes Common Stock subject to such Alkermes Stock Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio. 

   

 (c) The adjustments provided in _Section 2.11_ with respect to any Alkermes Options that are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) are intended to be effected in a manner that is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.

If the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount is positive, then the amount of the Cash Payment to be delivered at the Closing shall be increased by the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount. If the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount is negative, then the amount of the Cash Payment to be delivered at the Closing shall be reduced by the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount. 

   

 (b) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, New Alkermes shall prepare a calculation, as of the Effective Time, of (i) the Modified Working Capital (the " _Closing Modified Working Capital_ "), (ii) the Net Cash Amount (the " _Closing Net Cash Amount_ "), and (iii) the calculation of the Closing Adjustment Amount (the " _Proposed Final Closing Adjustment Amount_ "). The Closing Modified Working Capital shall be calculated in the same manner and based on the same items as the Modified Working Capital Statement. 

   

 (c) After receipt of the calculations of the Closing Modified Working Capital and Closing Net Cash Amount, Elan shall have thirty (30) days to review such calculations together with the workpapers used in the preparation thereof. Elan and its authorized Representatives shall have access upon reasonable notice during normal business hours to all relevant books and records and employees of New Alkermes and the New Alkermes Group Entities to the extent required to complete their review of the calculations of Closing Modified Working Capital and Closing Net Cash Amount;  _provided_ , that such access shall not 

      ##### 

  

    

unreasonably disrupt the personnel and operations of New Alkermes or any of
its Subsidiaries. Unless Elan delivers written notice to New Alkermes on or
prior to the thirtieth (30th) day after Elans receipt of the calculations of
Closing Modified Working Capital and Closing Net Cash Amount specifying in
reasonable detail all disputed items and the basis therefor, Elan shall be
deemed to have accepted and agreed to such calculations. If Elan so notifies
New Alkermes of its objection to such calculations, New Alkermes and Elan
shall, within thirty (30) days following such notice (the " _Resolution
Period_ "), attempt to resolve their differences and any resolution by them
as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive. 

   

 (d) If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, amounts shall remain in dispute, then all amounts remaining in dispute shall be submitted to Ernst and Young LLP or another firm of internationally recognized independent public accountants (the " _Neutral Auditors_ ") selected by Elan and New Alkermes within ten (10) days after the expiration of the Resolution Period. If Elan and New Alkermes are unable to agree on the Neutral Auditors, then Elan and New Alkermes shall each have the right to request the American Arbitration Association to appoint the Neutral Auditors who shall not have had a material business relationship with Elan, New Alkermes or any of their respective Affiliates within the past two (2) years. The Parties agree to execute, if requested by the Neutral Auditors, a reasonable engagement letter. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Auditors shall be borne equally by Elan and New Alkermes. The Neutral Auditors shall act as an arbitrator to determine only those issues still in dispute. The Neutral Auditors determination shall be made within thirty (30) days of their selection, shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to Elan and New Alkermes and shall be final, binding and conclusive. The terms " _Final Modified Working Capital_ ", " _Final Net Cash Amount_ " and " _Final Closing Adjustment Amount_ " as used herein, shall mean the definitive Modified Working Capital, Net Cash Amount and Closing Adjustment Amount, in each case, as of the Effective Time, agreed or deemed to have been agreed to by Elan and New Alkermes in accordance with  _Section 2.15(c)_ or resulting from the determinations made by the Neutral Auditors in accordance with this _Section 2.15(d)_ (in addition to those items theretofore agreed to by Elan and New Alkermes). 

   

 (e) The Closing Payments shall be increased dollar for dollar by the amount, if any, by which the Final Closing Adjustment Amount exceeds the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount or reduced dollar for dollar by the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount exceeds the Final Closing Adjustment Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is not greater or less than the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount, no adjustment to the Closing Payments shall be made pursuant to this _Section 2.15_. 

   

 (f) Any reduction in the Closing Payments made pursuant to _Section 2.15(e)_ shall be paid by Elan, within five (5) Business Days after the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is agreed upon or deemed to have been agreed upon by New Alkermes and Elan or the written statement of the Neutral Auditors setting forth their determination regarding any remaining disputed items is delivered to New Alkermes and Elan (such fifth (5th) Business Day, the " _Adjustment Payment Date_ "), by delivery to New Alkermes of the amount of such reduction (which shall bear interest from (and including) the Closing Date through (and including) the date of payment at the publicly announced prime interest rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect from time to 

      ##### 

  

    

time for unsecured short-term commercial loans) in cash in U.S. dollars. The
amount of any such reduction shall be distributed or contributed to the New
Alkermes Group Entities by New Alkermes as necessary or appropriate to
reflect the adjustments that resulted in such payment. Any increase in the
Closing Payments made pursuant to _Section 2.15(e)_ shall be paid by
New Alkermes by delivery to Elan on the Adjustment Payment Date of the amount
of the increase (which shall bear interest from (and including) the Closing
Date through (and including) the date of payment at the publicly announced
prime interest rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect from time to time for
unsecured short-term commercial loans) in cash in U.S. dollars. The amount of
any such increase shall be allocated or charged to the New Alkermes Group
Entities by New Alkermes as necessary or appropriate to reflect the
adjustments that resulted in such payment.

Closing, the restrictions on the use and disclosure of "Information" (as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) set forth therein shall not apply
to New Alkermes and its Affiliates and Representatives in respect of any such
Information relating to the Business, New Alkermes or the New Alkermes
Group Entities (in addition to, for the avoidance of doubt, constituting

such information, knowledge and data (a " _Receiving Party_ "), (ii) is or

source other than the Party to which such information, knowledge and data

obligations to the Party to which such information, knowledge and data
relates, or (iii) the Receiving Party can establish that it independently

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: 

  

 (a) Between the date hereof and the Closing (i) the Elan Parties shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to, take such steps as are necessary (A) to effect the Reorganization specifically as described on _Schedule 1_ hereto or as otherwise mutually and reasonably agreed by Elan and Alkermes and (B) ensure that New Alkermes and the New Alkermes Group Entities hold all of the assets and liabilities of the Business (including any Designated Assets and the EDDI Contracts) and no other assets or liabilities (including assets or liabilities relating to any Excluded Assets) other than the Additional Assets, and (ii) Alkermes shall take and shall cause its Subsidiaries to take such steps as are necessary to effect those portions of the Reorganization that are reflected in _Schedule 1_ as being consummated by Alkermes and its Subsidiaries in connection with the Reorganization and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

Elan shall make available to Alkermes in a timely 

   ##### 

  

 

manner for review and comment all drafts of the Reorganization Transfer
Agreements or other instruments or documentation relating to the
Reorganization Transfers or the Reorganization, and Elan shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to, execute any such Reorganization
Transfer Agreements or other instruments or documentation, or take any
actions or consummate any steps or transactions contemplated thereby, in each
case, that is not reasonably satisfactory to Alkermes. 

   

 (b) With respect to Business Assets that are EDDI Contracts, Elan shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause EDDI to assign all of EDDIs right, title and interest in an to such contracts, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens, to the U.S. Acquired Entities or another New Alkermes Group Entity designated by Alkermes as part of the Reorganization Transfers. With respect to all Business Assets that are contracts (including EDDI Contracts), Elan shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers or approvals of any parties to such contracts as are required thereunder in connection with the Transactions or for any such contracts to remain in full force and effect, all of which are required to be listed on _Section 3.3_ of the Elan Disclosure Schedule, so as to preserve all rights of, and benefits to, the Business under such contracts from and after the Closing. If any such contracts may not be transferred without the consent, waiver or approval of any Person or as a result of any Law restricting such transfer, Elan shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to secure such consent, waiver or approval. If, notwithstanding such reasonable best efforts, Elan and its Subsidiaries are unable to secure any such consent, waiver or approval, then no transfer of such contacts will occur if to do so without such consent, waiver or approval would constitute a breach or other contravention of the rights of such Person until such consent, waiver or approval is obtained, and any assignment or transfer shall be made subject to such consent, waiver or approval being obtained. To the extent any such consent, waiver or approval is not obtained, Elan shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, continue, upon the request of Alkermes, to use its reasonable best efforts to secure such consent, waiver or approval and the Parties will mutually agree in good faith on reasonable alternative arrangements that would result in New Alkermes and the New Alkermes Group Entities receiving all the benefits of such contracts until such time as such consent, waiver or approval has been obtained and such assignment effected. 

  

 (c) Following the Closing, to the extent any assets or rights of the Business have been retained by Elan and the Continuing Affiliates, Elan shall and shall cause the Continuing Affiliates to use their best efforts to convey such assets or rights to New Alkermes, the Surviving Corporation and the New Alkermes Group Entities as promptly as practicable (and pending such conveyance to provide New Alkermes, the Surviving Corporation and the New Alkermes Group Entities with the benefit of such assets).

 (e) As soon as reasonably practicable, Elan shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to use their reasonable best efforts to terminate all sale and leaseback

arrangements (including any defeasance leases) entered into by Elan or any of
its Subsidiaries in respect of any Business Assets and upon such termination
provide Alkermes with evidence that (i) all sale and leaseback arrangements

respect of any Business Assets have been terminated, (ii) all amounts due
under such arrangements, including any termination payments, have been
discharged in full, (iii) all security granted in relation to any such
arrangements has been fully and unconditionally released, and (iv) title to

terminated prior to the Closing, then Elan shall and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to continue to use their reasonable best efforts
to terminate such arrangements until such termination is obtained, and the
Parties will mutually agree in good faith on alternative arrangements that
would result in New Alkermes and the New Alkermes Group Entities receiving
all the benefits of ownership of the underlying Business Assets (to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law) until such time as the termination
has been effected; _provided_ , that in no event shall any alternative
arrangements or the termination of such sale and leaseback arrangements
result in New Alkermes or any of its Subsidiaries being required to pay any
amount or relinquish any right. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any real property or other assets or facilities, or any rights or services, are determined to be shared or used jointly by the Business, on the one hand, and the businesses of Elan and its Subsidiaries other than the Business, on the other hand, the Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to reach equitable arrangements under which such real property, assets, facilities, rights and services will cease to be shared at or prior to the Closing. If no such arrangement is reached, the Parties will mutually agree in good faith on reasonable transition arrangements on reasonable commercial terms (in addition to those set forth in the Transition Services Agreement) that will allow such sharing to cease as soon as practicable following the Closing (except to the extent the Parties agree on longer term sharing arrangements, which shall be agreed on an arms-length basis). 

  

 (g) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, to the extent any Transferred Books and Records are not delivered at the Closing pursuant to and as permitted by _Section 2.13(iii)_ , Elan shall, and shall cause the Continuing Affiliates to, deliver such Transferred Books and Records to New Alkermes. In addition, to the extent that certain Books and Records held by Elan or any Continuing Affiliate contain information relating to the Business but such Books and Records relate primarily to businesses other than the Business, such Books and Records shall be retained by Elan or any Continuing Affiliate, who shall, to the extent requested to do so, provide copies of the relevant portions thereof to New Alkermes.

   ##### 

  

 

copy thereof to Elan. In the event that all conditions to the Financing have

lenders and the other Persons providing such Financing to fund on the Closing
Date the portion of the Financing required to pay the Cash Payment, including
using its reasonable best efforts to enforce its rights under the
Commitment Letter, to cause such lenders or other Persons to fund such
portion of the Financing. Alkermes shall have the right from time to time to
amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights
under, the Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing Agreements,
and/or substitute other debt or equity financing for all or any portion of
the Financing from the same and/or alternative financing sources; _provided_
, that any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to
or waiver of any provision of the Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing
Agreements that amends the Financing and/or substitution of all or any
portion of the Financing (A) shall not expand upon the conditions precedent
or contingencies to the Financing as set forth in the Commitment Letter and
(B) would not reasonably be expected to prevent or impede or delay the
availability of the Financing and/or the consummation of the Transactions and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Alkermes shall be permitted
to reduce the amount of Financing under the Commitment Letter or Definitive
Financing Agreements in its reasonable discretion; _provided_ , _further_ ,

upon the conditions precedent or contingencies to the Financing as set forth
in the Commitment Letter and (B) would not reasonably be expected to prevent
or impede or delay the availability of the Financing and/or the consummation
of the Transactions and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If
any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable or Alkermes becomes aware of
any event or circumstance that makes any portion of the Financing
unavailable, in each case, on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Commitment Letter (including any "flex" provisions contained therein), and
such portion is reasonably required to pay the Cash Payment, Alkermes shall
use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event alternative financing from
the same and/or alternative financing sources in an amount sufficient to pay
the Cash Payment upon conditions no less favorable to Alkermes and its
Subsidiaries than those contained in the Commitment Letter and, if obtained,
will provide Elan with a copy of the documentation with respect to such
alternative financing. Alkermes shall give Elan prompt oral and written
notice (but in any event not later than twenty-four (24) hours) after Alkermes
becoming aware of the occurrence of any material breach by any party to the
Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing Agreements or of any condition not
likely to be satisfied, or of any termination or waiver, amendment or other
modification of the Commitment Letter. Alkermes shall keep Elan informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange, obtain
and/or consummate the Financing and shall provide copies of the principal
documents related to the Financing (excluding fee letters, except excerpts of
those portions thereof that contain any conditions to funding or "flex"
provisions (excluding provisions related solely to fees and economic terms)).

extent permitted by the Commitment Letter shall not be deemed to violate
Alkermes obligations under this Agreement.

ARTICLE VI 

   

Employee Benefits Matters 

  

 Section 6.1. _Employee Plans_. 

  

 (a) _Generally_. Except as specifically set forth in this _Section 6.1_, none of New Alkermes or its Subsidiaries shall assume responsibility for any liability, cost, expense or obligation under, or sponsorship of, any Employee Plan, or, in respect of the U.S. Acquired Entity, continue following the Closing Date to be a participating employer under any Employee Plan. 

  

 (b) _Transition Bonus Arrangement_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Accrued Bonus Expense_ " means the liability included in the Estimated Modified Working Capital in respect of bonus amounts under the Elan Cash Bonus Plan with respect to the performance of Transferred Employees in 2011. New Alkermes shall maintain a performance bonus plan (the " _New Alkermes Transition Bonus Plan_ ") for the benefit of Transferred Employees for calendar year 2011, the terms, conditions, targets and performance measures under which shall be established in the discretion of the board of directors of New Alkermes or the compensation committee thereof following the Closing. In any event, New Alkermes shall pay bonuses under the New Alkermes Transition Bonus Plan to Transferred Employees that are not less than the sum of (i) the Accrued Bonus Expense for services through the Closing Date, and (ii) an additional amount based on actual results for New Alkermes and the New Alkermes Group Entities, on a consolidated or business unit basis, for the period from the Closing Date through December 31, 2011, that is consistent for each Transferred Employee with the bonus 

   ##### 

  

 

opportunity that such Transferred Employee had under the Elan Cash Bonus Plan
for 2011. The parties intend that this clause _(b)_ shall not have any effect
if the Closing Date occurs after December 31, 2011. 

   

 (c) _Vacation_. The Estimated Modified Working Capital shall reflect a liability in respect of accrued but unused vacation and related taxes if any for Transferred Employees based on rates of base pay as of the Closing Date. New Alkermes shall credit Transferred Employees with an amount of accrued but unused vacation immediately following the Closing Date equal to the amount of accrued but unused vacation time taken into account for purposes of such accrual, subject to the generally applicable terms of the applicable vacation program of New Alkermes or its Subsidiaries as in effect from time to time but with no diminution in the amount of accrued but unused vacation for any Transferred Employee. 

  

 (d) _Service Credit_. Transferred Employees shall be given credit under each Post-Closing Employee Plan in which they are eligible to participate for all service with Elan or any of its Subsidiaries (to the extent such credit was given under the applicable Employee Plan maintained by Elan or its Subsidiaries) for purposes of eligibility and vesting, and, solely for purposes of any vacation pay plan and stock option accelerated vesting and extended exercise period, for benefit accrual purposes. For the sake of clarity, the employee stock option retirement provision and the vacation accrual policy are the only Post-Closing Employee Plans that are expected to provide benefits based on service credit. 

  

 (e) _Credit for Deductibles_. New Alkermes shall give each Transferred Employee credit for the amount of deductibles borne by such Transferred Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) prior to the Closing Date under an Employee Plan that is a welfare benefit plan for purposes of satisfying the deductible limitations under each Post-Closing Employee Plan that is a corresponding welfare benefit plan, subject to receipt of relevant information or documentation confirming the amount of such deductibles. 

  

 Section 6.2. _U.S. Employees_. 

  

 (a) _Benefit Continuation_. For one year following the Closing Date, New Alkermes or its applicable Subsidiary shall continue to provide all U.S. Employees with base compensation no less than the base compensation in effect for such U.S. Employees immediately prior to the Closing. For one year following the Closing Date, New Alkermes and its Subsidiaries shall maintain Post-Closing Employee Plans which provide benefits to U.S. Employees that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided under the Employee Plans in effect on the Closing Date covering U.S. Employees (excluding equity-based compensation, but including a flexible spending account under which each U.S. Employee shall be credited with an opening balance equal to that as immediately prior to the Closing Date under the comparable plan of Elan and its Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date) or, at the election of New Alkermes, Post-Closing Employee Plans that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to similarly situated employees of Alkermes (excluding equity-based compensation, but including a flexible spending account under which each U.S. Employee shall be credited with an opening balance equal to that as immediately prior to the Closing Date under the comparable plan of Elan and its Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date); _provided_ , that nothing herein shall require New 

   ##### 

  

 

Alkermes or its Subsidiaries to continue the employment of any Transferred
Employee for any period or to duplicate any benefits. 

   

 (b) _COBRA_. Elan shall remain responsible for satisfying obligations under Section 601  _et_ _seq._ of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code (" _COBRA coverage_ ") and any applicable similar state laws, to provide continuation coverage to or with respect to any U.S. Employee in accordance with Law with respect to any "qualifying event" prior to the Effective Time. New Alkermes shall be responsible for COBRA coverage for any U.S. Employees who has a qualifying event following the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) _401(k) Plan_. Effective as of the Closing Date, New Alkermes shall have in effect a qualified defined contribution plan (the " _New Alkermes 401(k) Plan_ ") that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code designed to provide benefits as of the Closing Date to the U.S. Employees, subject to the terms and conditions thereof. Effective as of the Closing Date, each U.S. Employee who was a participant in the Elan U.S. 401(k) Plan shall be entitled to a distribution of his or her respective account balance in accordance with the terms of the Elan U.S. 401(k) Plan and as permitted by the Code. The New Alkermes 401(k) Plan shall provide for the receipt of individual rollovers of benefits so distributed from the Elan U.S. 401(k) Plan. 

  

 Section 6.3. _Ireland Employees_. 

  

 (a) Elan and its Continuing Affiliates and New Alkermes acknowledge and agree that the Reorganization Transfers provided for in steps 3,4 and 6 of _Schedule 1_ each constitute a TUPE Transfer. Upon the occurrence of any such TUPE Transfer, subject to _Section 6.3(d)_ and _Schedule J_ and except in respect of any equity based compensation, the contracts of employment of each of the Ireland Employees whose employment transfers pursuant to any such TUPE Transfer will have effect from the applicable TUPE Transfer Date as if originally made between ES5 or Interco (as the case may be) and each such Ireland Employee. Elan and its Subsidiaries and New Alkermes agree that the provisions of this _Section 6.3_ shall not operate to increase the obligations of the parties beyond those pursuant to the Transfer Regulations. 

  

 (b) Elan and New Alkermes shall together deliver to the Ireland Employees letters and notices, in the Agreed Form, between them notifying the Ireland Employees of the transfer of their employment under any TUPE Transfer, which Agreed Form will include the provisions set forth in  _Schedule I_. 

  

 (c) Elan and its Subsidiaries shall ensure that all salaries and wages of, and all other employers obligations relating to, the Ireland Employees are discharged or accrued and all tax deductions and pay-related social insurance obligations and Transfer Regulations relative to the Ireland Employees are complied with and made by Elan and its Subsidiaries in respect of all periods up to the Closing Date. 

  

 (d) For one year following the Closing Date, New Alkermes or its applicable Subsidiary shall continue to provide all Ireland Employees with base compensation no less than the base compensation in effect for such Ireland Employees immediately prior to the Closing. Except as provided in  _Schedule J_, with which the Parties agree to comply, for one year following 

   ##### 

  

 

the Closing Date, New Alkermes and its Subsidiaries shall maintain Post-
Closing Employee Plans which provide benefits to each Ireland Employee
required to be continued after the Effective Time by the Transfer Regulations
or, in respect of pension and death benefits, required to be continued after
the Effective Time under _Schedule J_, no less favorable in the aggregate
than those provided under the applicable Employee Plans of Elan and its
Subsidiaries in effect on the applicable TUPE Transfer Date (excluding
equity-based compensation, which shall be determined in the sole discretion
of the compensation committee of the New Alkermes board of directors); 
_provided_ , that, subject to compliance with applicable Law, nothing herein
shall require New Alkermes or its Subsidiaries to continue the employment of
any Transferred Employee for any period or to duplicate any benefits. 

   

 (e) In respect of all periods after and including the Closing Date, New Alkermes shall discharge all salaries and wages and all other employers obligations relating to the Ireland Employees and shall comply with all tax deductions and pay-related social insurance obligations and Transfer Regulations relating to the Ireland Employees. 

  

 (f) Each of Elan and its Continuing Affiliates and Interco shall comply with its respective obligations arising under the Transfer Regulations, including Regulation 8. 

  

 (g) Prior to any Ireland Employees employment transferring to Interco, and if Interco or any Subsidiary of Interco acts as a principal employer or as a participating employer in the EDT Pharma Pension Schemes and any such scheme has not been wound up by that date, Interco or any such Subsidiary shall cease to act as principal employer of or as a participating employer in the EDT Pharma Pension Schemes by executing all appropriate documentation in an Agreed Form. 

  

 Section 6.4. _Miscellaneous_. 

  

 (a) _No Right to Employment_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall create any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be, or shall be construed as, an amendment to any employee benefit plan, program, arrangement, policy or agreement. 

  

 (b) _Assistance with Claims_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Article VI_, each of Elan and its Continuing Affiliates, and New Alkermes and its Subsidiaries shall at its own expense give the other party such assistance as the other party may reasonably require to contest any claim by any person employed in the Business at or prior to the Closing which results from or is in connection with this Agreement.

 (a) Except as set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ of the Elan Disclosure Schedule, New Alkermes and the New Alkermes Group Entities have timely filed or caused to be filed (or had 

   ##### 

  

 

filed on their behalf) all material federal, state, local and non-U.S. Tax
Returns (including those filed on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis)
required to have been filed by (or on behalf of) any of them. All of the
foregoing Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all material
respects, and set forth all items to the extent required to be reflected or
included in such Tax Returns. New Alkermes and the New Alkermes Group
Entities have, within the time and manner prescribed by applicable Law, paid
all material Taxes required to be paid in respect of the periods covered by
such Tax Returns or otherwise due to any Taxing Authority (whether or not
shown on any Tax Return). None of New Alkermes or the New Alkermes Group
Entities has requested or filed any document having the effect of causing any
extension of time within which to file any Tax Returns in respect of any
fiscal year which have not since been filed. No deficiencies for any Tax have
been proposed, asserted or assessed, in each case, by any Taxing Authority,
against any of New Alkermes or the New Alkermes Group Entities. There are no
pending requests for waivers of the time to assess any Tax, other than those

Alkermes or the New Alkermes Group Entities has waived any statute
of limitations in respect of any Taxes or agreed to any extension of time
with respect to any Tax assessment or deficiency. There are no material Liens
with respect to Taxes upon any of the properties or assets, real or personal,
tangible or intangible of any of New Alkermes or the New Alkermes Group
Entities, or the Business Assets (other than Liens for Taxes not yet due

a jurisdiction where New Alkermes or any New Alkermes Group Entity does not
file Tax Returns that such Person is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction. 

   

 (b) None of New Alkermes or the New Alkermes Group Entities is the subject of any currently pending material Tax audit or administrative or judicial Tax proceeding, and no Elan Party expects any authority to assess any additional material Taxes for any period for which Tax Returns have been filed. None of New Alkermes or any New Alkermes Group Entity has received from any Taxing Authority any notice indicating an intent to open an audit or other review. 

  

 (c) New Alkermes and the New Alkermes Group Entities have withheld and paid or have caused to be withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third party.

 (e) None of New Alkermes or the New Alkermes Group Entities has been a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable period specified in section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) No shares in the New Alkermes Group Entities have at any time during the Reorganization derived the greater part of their value from any of the assets specified in Section 29 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 of Ireland (the " _TCA_ "). 

  

 (g) None of New Alkermes or the New Alkermes Group Entities is or has been a party to any "reportable transaction," as defined in section 6707A(c)(1) of the Code and Treasury Regulation section 1.6011-4(b) that is or was required to be reported to the relevant Taxing Authority. 

  

 (h) None of New Alkermes or the New Alkermes Group Entities has any liability for any material Tax (i) of any Person other than New Alkermes and the New Alkermes Group Entities, including under Treasury Regulations section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of any Similar Law), as transferee or successor or by contract, (ii) as a result of any change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (iii) as a result of any "closing agreement" as described in section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date, or (iv) as a result of any installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 (i) The documents listed in _Section 7.1(i)_ of the Elan Disclosure Schedule are true, accurate, and complete in all material respects, and include all material information that is responsive to the information request on "Substantial Business Activities" provided by Alkermes to Elan on March 1, 2011. 

  

 (j) Each of New Alkermes and the New Alkermes Group Entities has disclosed on their federal income Tax Returns all positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning of Code section 6662(d). Except as disclosed in  _Section 7.1(j)_ of the Elan Disclosure Schedule, none of New Alkermes or the New Alkermes Group Entities has requested or received a ruling from any Taxing Authority or signed a closing or other agreement with any Taxing Authority relating to Taxes which would have an effect with respect to any taxable period ending on or after the Closing Date. 

  

 (k) Since acquiring the intellectual property which is transferred as part of the Reorganization Transfers described in Step 6 of _Schedule 1_, EPIL and Interco have been carrying on a trade of dealing in intellectual property, including the buying and selling of intellectual property and all income and gains earned from this trade have qualified for the rate of corporation tax in Ireland specified in Section 21(1) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. 

  

 (l) Each New Alkermes Group Entity (other than Merger Sub, Eagle Holdings, U.S. Holdco and the U.S. Acquired Entities) is resident for tax purposes only in Ireland and no such entity has any liability for tax in any other jurisdiction. 

  

 (m) At the Closing, no part of the Business will be subject to taxation in any jurisdiction other than the United States or Ireland. 

  

 (n) The tax basis (for the purposes of Schedule D Case I) in the intellectual property transferred to it as part of the Reorganization Transfers described in Step 6 of _Schedule_  

   ##### 

  

 

 _1_ , is $299 million. There has been no appropriation from trading stock of
any of such intellectual property. 

   

 (o) Prior to the issue of shares by Interco as part of the Reorganization Transfers, Interco has never been a member of the same group for the purposes of Section 616 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 as EPIL or ES5. Prior to the issue of shares by New Alkermes as part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, New Alkermes has never been a member of the same group for the purposes of Section 616 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 as ES3. 

  

 Section 7.2. _Tax Indemnification_. (a) From and after the Closing Date, the Elan Tax Indemnitors shall pay or cause to be paid, and jointly and severally shall indemnify each Alkermes Tax Indemnitee and protect, save and hold each Alkermes Tax Indemnitee harmless from and against the following Taxes: 

   

 (i) any Tax imposed upon or relating to Elan or any of the Continuing Affiliates for any period, including any such Tax for which any of the Alkermes Tax Indemnitees (or any Subsidiary thereof) may be liable (w) under Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations (or any similar provision of any Similar Law), (x) as a transferee or successor, (y) by contract or (z) otherwise, on a secondary or joint and several basis; 

   

 (ii) any Tax imposed upon any of New Alkermes, the New Alkermes Group Entities or the Business Assets with respect to any Pre-Closing Period, including any interest, penalties, additions to tax or other additional amounts imposed with respect thereto, other than (w) any such Taxes that are accounted for in the Closing Modified Working Capital (x) Taxes imposed solely and directly as a result of the merger of Alkermes and Merger Sub, which Taxes are not associated with a transaction prior to the Closing Date of any of New Alkermes or its direct and indirect Subsidiaries, and for the avoidance of doubt, any Tax arising as a result of the ceasing of any of New Alkermes or its direct and indirect Subsidiaries on prior to the Closing Date to be a member of any group (including any consolidated group, affiliated group, or otherwise) for any Tax purpose is not excluded from indemnification by this _Section 7.2(a)(ii)(x)_, (y) Taxes imposed on Alkermes or Interco in connection with Step 12A of _Schedule 1_ and (z) Taxes imposed as a result of the borrowing by Merger Sub and the payment of $500 million to New Alkermes in Step 12B/C of _Schedule 1_; 

   

 (iii) any Covered Losses or Taxes incurred or sustained by any Alkermes Tax Indemnitee arising out of a breach of representations contained in _Section 7.1_ ; and 

   

 (iv) any Taxes (including Transfer Taxes) imposed in connection with the transactions described in _Schedule 1_ other than (x) Taxes imposed solely and directly as a result of the merger of Alkermes and Merger Sub, which Taxes are not associated with a prior transaction prior to the Closing Date of any of New Alkermes or its direct and indirect Subsidiaries, and for the 

   ##### 

  

   

avoidance of doubt, any Tax arising as a result of the ceasing of any of
New Alkermes or its direct and indirect Subsidiaries on prior to the Closing
Date to be a member of any group (including any consolidated group,
affiliated group, or otherwise) for any Tax purpose is not excluded from
indemnification by this  _Section 7.2(a)(iv)(x)_, (y) Taxes imposed on
Alkermes or Interco in connection with Step 12A of _Schedule 1_ and (z)

 (c) The Alkermes Tax Indemnitees shall not be entitled to assert any indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ after the end of the applicable survival period as specified in  _Section 7.12_; _provided_ , that, if on or prior to the last date of such survival period, Alkermes shall have provided Elan with written notice of a claim for indemnification under this _Section 7.2_, then the Alkermes Tax Indemnitees shall continue to have the right to be indemnified with respect to such indemnification claim until such claim has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in this _Article VII_. 

  

 Section 7.3. _Allocation of Certain Taxes_. For purposes of this _Article VII_, in order to apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to a Straddle Period, the Parties hereto shall, to the extent permitted or required under applicable Law, treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or period for all purposes of New Alkermes and the New Alkermes Group Entities. In the case of Taxes arising in a taxable period of any of New Alkermes or the New Alkermes Group Entities, or with respect to a Business Asset, that includes but does not end on the Closing Date, except as otherwise provided in this _Section 7.3_, the portion of such Taxes that are allocable to the Pre-Closing Period shall be (x) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis, franchise Taxes based on capitalization, debt or shares of stock authorized, issued or outstanding and ad valorem Taxes, the amount of such Taxes for the entire taxable period, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in such taxable period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the entire number of calendar days in such taxable period, and the balance of such Taxes shall be attributable to the Post-Closing Period; _provided_ , that if any property, asset or other right of any of New Alkermes or the New Alkermes Group Entities, or any Business Asset, is sold, disposed of or deemed disposed of or otherwise transferred or realized for any Tax purpose on or prior to the Closing Date, then ad valorem, capital gains, transfer or other Taxes pertaining to such property, asset or other right shall be attributed entirely to the Pre-Closing Period; and (y) in the case of Taxes not described in (x) the amount that would be payable on the basis of an interim closing of the books as of the end of the Closing Date. For purposes of this _Section 7.3_, (i) any Tax on gain or income resulting from the triggering into income of deferred intercompany transactions under Section 1.1502-13 of the Treasury Regulations or excess loss accounts under Section 1.1502-19 of the Treasury Regulations or under Part 20 of the TCA that occurs as a result of the Reorganization or the Merger shall be considered to be attributable to the Pre-Closing Period and (ii) each partnership or "flowthrough" entity in which any of New Alkermes 

   ##### 

  

 

or the New Alkermes Group Entities holds an interest shall be treated as if
its taxable year ended at the close of business on the Closing Date and Taxes
attributable to the income and gain of such entities through the close of
business on the Closing Date (as determined in a reasonably practicable
manner) shall be considered to be attributable to the Pre-Closing Period. 

   

 Section 7.4. _Carryovers, Refunds and Related Matters_. (a) Any refund or credit of Taxes (including any interest thereon) received by New Alkermes or any of the New Alkermes Group Entities and that is a refund or credit of Taxes with respect to a Pre-Closing Period, other than any such refunds or credits that are accounted for in the Closing Modified Working Capital, shall be for the account of Elan and shall be promptly reimbursed to Elan or its designee by New Alkermes or the New Alkermes Group Entity. 

  

 (b) Any refund or credit of Taxes (including any interest thereon) that relates to any of Alkermes, New Alkermes, the New Alkermes Group Entities or their respective Subsidiaries and that is a refund or credit of Taxes with respect to a Post-Closing Period that is received by Elan or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be the property of Alkermes, New Alkermes, the New Alkermes Group Entity or their relevant Subsidiary and shall be promptly paid by Elan to such Person. 

  

 (c) In applying _Sections 7.4(a)_ and _7.4(b)_ , any refund or credit of Taxes (including any interest thereon) for a Straddle Period shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing Period in accordance with _Section 7.3_. 

  

 Section 7.5. _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_. (a) Elan shall file or cause to be filed (i) any combined, consolidated or unitary Return that includes Elan, any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Elan that directly or indirectly holds an equity interest in New Alkermes or any Continuing Affiliate and (ii) any other Return of any of New Alkermes or the New Alkermes Group Entities for any taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date. All such Returns shall be true, correct and complete in all material respects and accurately set forth all items to the extent required to be reflected or included in such Tax Returns by applicable Law. All such Returns shall be timely filed in a manner consistent with past practice, shall not include any change in any method of accounting (unless required by Law) and shall not include any Tax election that is inconsistent with past practice. Elan shall, reasonably promptly after the filing of a Return described in clause _(i)_ or _(ii)_ above, provide New Alkermes a copy of such Return (or a copy of a pro forma separate Return in the case of a Return described in clause  _(i)_ ). Elan shall remit to the relevant Taxing Authority all Taxes shown by such Returns to be due. New Alkermes shall cause the New Alkermes Group Entities to furnish information to Elan in connection with any such Return, at Elans expense, in accordance with the past procedures, customs and practices of Elan. 

  

 (b) Except to the extent set forth in _Section 7.5(a)_, New Alkermes shall file or cause to be filed all Returns of, or that include, New Alkermes and any of the New Alkermes Group Entities. 

  

 (c) With respect to any Return of any of New Alkermes or the New Alkermes Group Entities for a Straddle Period (such a Return, a " _Straddle Period Return_ "), New Alkermes shall deliver a copy of such Return to Elan at least forty (40) Business Days prior to the due date 

   ##### 

  

 

(giving effect to any extension thereof), accompanied by an allocation between
the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing Period of the Taxes shown to be
due on such Return. Such Return and allocation shall not be filed or become
final without prior written consent of Elan (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of
receipt by Elan of such Return and allocation, Elan may deliver to New
Alkermes a written request for changes to such Return or allocation. If Elan
does not deliver such a request within such period, the Return and allocation
shall be final and binding. If Elan delivers such a request, then New
Alkermes and Elan shall undertake in good faith to resolve the issues raised
in such request prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for
filing such Return. If New Alkermes and Elan are unable to resolve any issue
within (10) Business Days from the date of receipt by new Alkermes of the
request for changes, then Elan and New Alkermes jointly shall engage the
Neutral Auditors to determine the correct treatment of the item or items in
dispute. Each of Elan and New Alkermes shall bear and pay one half of the

Subject to the limitations set forth in  _Sections 9.2(b)_ and _9.3(b)_ , no failure or delay by New Alkermes or Elan in the performance of the foregoing shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligation of Elan or Alkermes, respectively, to indemnify and hold the Alkermes Indemnified Parties or the Elan Indemnified Parties, respectively, harmless, except to the extent that such failure or delay shall have actually adversely affected the ability of Alkermes or Elan, as the case may be, to defend against or satisfy any Covered Losses for which the party seeking indemnification is entitled to indemnification hereunder. 

  

 (b) If the claim or demand set forth in the Notice of Claim given pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)_ hereof is a claim or demand asserted by a third party, the party receiving such Notice of Claim shall have fifteen (15) days after the date on which Notice of Claim is given to notify the party giving such Notice of Claim in writing of its election to defend such third party claim or demand on behalf of the party seeking indemnification. If the party receiving such Notice of Claim elects, on behalf of Alkermes or Elan, as the case may be, to defend such third party claim or demand, the party seeking indemnification shall make available to the indemnifying party and its agents and representatives all records and other materials which are reasonably required in the defense of such third party claim or demand and shall otherwise cooperate with, and assist the indemnifying party in the defense of, such third party claim or demand, and so long as Elan or Alkermes, as the case may be, is defending such third party claim in good faith, the Alkermes Indemnified Parties or Elan Indemnified Parties, as applicable, shall not pay, settle or compromise such third party claim or demand. In such case, Alkermes or Elan, as the case may be, may pay, settle or compromise such third party claim or demand (i) with the written consent of Elan or Alkermes, on behalf of the Elan Indemnified Parties or the Alkermes Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, or (ii) without such consent, so long as such settlement includes (A) an unconditional release of the Elan Indemnified Parties or the Alkermes 

   ##### 

  

 

Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, from all Liability in respect of such
claim or litigation, (B) does not subject the indemnified parties to any
injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, and (C) does not include a
statement or admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on
behalf of any indemnified party. If the party receiving such Notice of Claim
elects to defend such third party claim or demand, (i) such assumption will
conclusively establish for purposes of this Agreement that the claims
described in such Notice of Claim are within the scope of and subject to
indemnification hereunder and (ii) the Alkermes Indemnified Party or the Elan
Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall have the right to participate in
the defense of such third party claim or demand, at such indemnified partys
own expense. In the event, however, that such indemnified party reasonably
determines that representation by counsel to the indemnifying parties of both
such indemnifying parties and the indemnified party could reasonably be
expected to present such counsel with a conflict of interest, then the
indemnified party may employ separate counsel to represent or defend it in
any such action or proceeding and the indemnifying parties will pay the fees
and expenses of such counsel; _provided_ , that Elan or Alkermes, as the case
may be, shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings
in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one
separate firm of attorneys (in addition to reasonably necessary local
counsel) at any time for all Alkermes Indemnified Parties or Elan Indemnified
Parties, as the case may be. If the party receiving such Notice of Claim does
not elect to defend such third party claim or demand or does not defend
such third party claim or demand in good faith, the Alkermes Indemnified
Parties or Elan Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, shall have the
right, in addition to any other right or remedy they may have hereunder, at
the expense of Elan or Alkermes, as the case may be, to defend such
third party claim or demand; _provided_ , that (i) such Alkermes Indemnified
Parties or Elan Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, shall not have any
obligation to participate in the defense of, or defend, any such third party
claim or demand; (ii) such Alkermes Indemnified Parties or Elan Indemnified
Parties, as the case may be, defense of or participation in the defense of
any such third party claim or demand shall not in any way diminish or lessen
the obligations of Elan or Alkermes, as applicable, under the agreements of
indemnification set forth in this _Article IX_; and (iii) such Alkermes
Indemnified Parties or Elan Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, may not
settle any claim without the consent of Elan or Alkermes, respectively (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

   

 (c) With respect to any third party claim subject to indemnification under this _Article IX_ : (i) both the party receiving such Notice of Claim and the Elan Indemnified Parties or Alkermes Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, shall keep the other Persons reasonably informed of the status of such third party claim and any related Actions at all stages thereof where such Person is not represented by its own counsel, and (ii) the Parties agree to render to each other such assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in good faith with each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any third party claim;  _provided_ , that the party receiving such Notice of Claim shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such cooperation (including reasonable legal fees and disbursements) by the Party providing such cooperation but shall not be required to compensate such Party for time spent by its officers, directors, employees or agents in such cooperation. 

  

 (d) Except for third party claims being defended in good faith, (i) Elan shall satisfy its obligations under this _Article IX_ in respect of a valid claim for indemnification hereunder which is not contested by Elan in good faith in cash within 30 days after the date on 

   ##### 

  

 

which Notice of Claim is given and (ii) Alkermes shall satisfy its obligations
under this  _Article IX_ in respect of a valid claim for indemnification
hereunder which is not contested by Alkermes in good faith in cash within 30
days after the date on which Notice of Claim is given. 

   

 Section 9.5. _Limitations; Additional Procedures_. (a) Elan shall have no liability for indemnification pursuant to clause _(i)_ of _Section 9.2(a)_ with respect to Covered Losses for which indemnification is provided thereunder, (i) that are De Minimis Damages, (ii) unless the aggregate of all Covered Losses (other than De Minimis Damages) exceeds $5,000,000 (the " _Threshold_ "), in which case Elan shall be liable for all such Covered Losses (other than De Minimis Damages), including the amount of the Threshold or (iii) in excess of $500 million in the aggregate. 

  

 (b) Alkermes shall have no liability for indemnification pursuant to clause _(i)_ of  _Section 9.3(a)_ with respect to Covered Losses for which indemnification is provided thereunder, (i) that are De Minimis Damages, (ii) unless the aggregate of all Covered Losses (other than De Minimis Damages) exceeds the Threshold, in which case Alkermes shall be liable for all such Covered Losses (other than De Minimis Damages), including the amount of the Threshold or (iii) in excess of $500 million in the aggregate. 

  

 (c) For purposes of any indemnity obligation under this _Article IX_ with respect to any breach of any covenant or obligation, or any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, any express qualifications or limitations set forth in such covenant or obligation, or representation or warranty, as to materiality, material adverse effect, "Business Material Adverse Effect" or "Alkermes Material Adverse Effect" (or other similar materiality qualifiers) contained therein, shall be disregarded. 

  

 (d) The right to indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy based upon the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge actually acquired at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Elan Indemnified Person or Alkermes Indemnified Person shall be entitled to any indemnification or reimbursement under any provisions of this Agreement for any amount to the extent such Person or its Affiliates has been indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any other provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or under any insurance policy. 

  

 (f) In no event shall Covered Losses be subject to indemnification under _Sections 9.2 _or _9.3_ to the extent such Covered Losses were included or taken into account in the calculation of the Final Modified Working Capital or Final Net Cash Amount. 

  

 (g) Except in the case of fraud, from and after the Closing, the exclusive remedy for any Elan Indemnified Person or Alkermes Indemnified Person for Covered Losses or other monetary damages arising from a breach of this Agreement or otherwise relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except as otherwise provided in any Ancillary 

   ##### 

  

 

Agreement) shall be the indemnification provided under this _Article IX_ or
_Article VII_. There shall be no remedy at law or otherwise for De Minimis
Damages arising out of the events or circumstances described in clause _(i)_
of _Sections 9.2(a)_ or  _9.3(a)_. Nothing in this Agreement shall interfere
with or impede a partys right to seek equitable remedies (including specific
performance or injunctive relief) to enforce any covenant in this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement. 

   

 (h) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE FOR (A) ANY PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR (B) ANY LOST PROFITS OR CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES; _provided, however_ , that if an Elan Indemnified Person or Alkermes Indemnified Person is held liable to a third party based on any final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction for any such Covered Losses and the applicable indemnifying party is obligated to indemnify such Person for the matter that gave rise to such Covered Losses, then such indemnifying party shall be liable for, and obligated to reimburse such Elan Indemnified Person or Alkermes Indemnified Person, as the case may be, for such Covered Losses. 

  

 Section 9.6. _Exclusive Tax Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article IX_, the above provisions of this _Article IX_ shall not apply to Tax indemnification matters, which matters shall instead be governed by _Article VII_.

 (f) By Alkermes, if Elan shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure (A) would render the condition in _Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.2(b)_ incapable of being satisfied, and (B) is incapable of being cured or has not been cured by Elan within 20 calendar days after written notice has been given by Alkermes to Elan of such breach or failure to perform; or
