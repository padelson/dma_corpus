Company as of the close of business as of the anticipated Closing Date

resolution of such dispute, if any such resolution is reached by the parties
pursuant to the negotiations contemplated by _Section 3.02(a)_. The Sellers
shall provide to Purchaser such data and information as Purchaser may
reasonably request supporting the amounts reflected in the Closing Statement,

shall notify the Sellers in writing no later than eight (8) days prior to the
Closing Date, and the Sellers and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith in
an effort to resolve such disputed Early Adjustment Amount or Later Adjustment
Amount, as the case may be, prior to the Closing. The Closing Purchase Price,

Adjustment Amount or the Later Adjustment Amount, as the case may be, and the
other adjustments thereto under this _Article III_, shall be paid in
accordance with _Section 3.01_.

 



 

(iii) The adjustment made at Closing pursuant to this paragraph (b) is
referred to herein as the " _Closing Adjustment_ ", and shall be subject to

(e) of this _Section 3.02_.

 



 

(c) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause its
accountants to prepare and deliver to the Sellers (i) a balance sheet of the

principles described in _Exhibit 3.02(a)(2)_ (such balance sheet, the "
_Final Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and (ii) a calculation of the PPA Adjustment
Amount as of the close of business on the Closing Date, immediately prior to
giving effect to the Closing, prepared in accordance with the principles
described in _Exhibit 1.01F_ (the " _Final PPA Adjustment Amount_ ").
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]. PurchaserÂ’s accountants shall consult with
the SellersÂ’ accountants in connection with the preparation of the Final
Closing Balance Sheet and the Final PPA Adjustment Amount, and each Party
shall permit the other PartiesÂ’ accountants, as reasonably required, to review
and have access to records, and to make copies of all work papers, schedules
and calculations, required or used in the preparation of the Final Closing
Balance Sheet and the Final PPA Adjustment Amount, all at the earliest
practicable date. Sellers shall cause their accountants to cooperate with
Purchaser and PurchaserÂ’s accountants in connection with the preparation of
the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Final PPA Adjustment Amount, including
by responding promptly to any requests by Purchaser or PurchaserÂ’s accountants
for information reasonably required to prepare such Final Closing Balance
Sheet and the Final PPA Adjustment Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, to the
extent any items, including trailing account payables, are used to prepare
both the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Final PPA Adjustment Amount, it
is the intent of the Parties that none of the Parties shall receive any
windfall as a result of redundancy (double-counting) that may be applied to
both the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Final PPA Adjustment Amount and
that each of the same may be adjusted with regard to such redundant item(s) to
avoid such windfall or double-counting.

 



 

(d) When the Purchaser delivers the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Final
PPA Adjustment Amount, Purchaser shall also deliver to the Sellers a
certificate, substantially in the form of _Exhibit 3.02(a)(3)_, containing

(i) the Net Working Capital of the Company as of the Closing Date (the "
_Closing Date Net Working Capital_ ") (based on the Final Closing Balance
Sheet), (ii) the Final PPA Adjustment Amount, and (iii) the adjustment to the
Closing Purchase Price that should have been made on the Closing Date pursuant
to _Section 3.02(b)_. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Final
Closing Balance Sheet, the Final PPA Adjustment Amount and the accompanying
certificate containing the PurchaserÂ’s Proposed Calculations, Sellers shall
notify the Purchaser in writing of their agreement or disagreement, as the
case may be, with (x) the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the accuracy of any
of the PurchaserÂ’s Proposed Calculations,

such written notice shall also include the SellersÂ’ proposed alternative

and the PurchaserÂ’s calculation of the Final PPA Adjustment Amount. If the
Purchaser and the Sellers are not able to resolve such dispute within thirty

and/or SellerÂ’s calculation of the Final PPA Adjustment Amount, then the
Sellers and Purchaser retain the Independent Accounting Firm to resolve the
remaining disputed items (the " _Remaining Disputed Items_ "), within thirty

Calculations and the SellersÂ’ Proposed Calculations, including the balance
sheets, expenses statements and other records on which each such calculations
were based, and thereafter selecting either PurchaserÂ’s Proposed Calculations
of the Remaining Disputed Items or the SellersÂ’ Proposed Calculations of the
Remaining Disputed Items or an amount in between the two and/or (ii) each of
the PurchaserÂ’s calculations and the SellersÂ’ calculations with regard to the
Final PPA Adjustment Amount, including the expenses statements and other
records on which each such calculations were based, and thereafter selecting
either PurchaserÂ’s calculations of the Remaining Disputed Items or the
SellersÂ’ calculations of the Remaining Disputed Items or an amount in between
the two. PurchaserÂ’s accountants and SellerÂ’s accountants shall be each
entitled to consult with the Independent Accounting Firm with respect to any
of the foregoing and the Independent Accounting FirmÂ’s calculations thereof,
and each Party shall permit the other PartiesÂ’ accountants, as reasonably
required, to review and have access to records, and to make copies of all work
papers, schedules and calculations, required or used by the Independent
Accounting Firm in connection with the foregoing determination. Purchaser and
the Sellers agree that they shall be bound by the determination of the
Remaining Disputed Items by the Independent Accounting Firm. [CONFIDENTIAL

SECTION 6.02 _Confidential Information_. (a) _Non-Disclosure_. For purposes
of this Agreement, any information concerning the Parties hereto, the Company,
or the Project, and which is disclosed to another Party pursuant to this
Agreement shall be considered " _Confidential Information_ " of the disclosing
Party. The Parties acknowledge that this Agreement itself constitutes the
Confidential Information of all of the Parties. Each Party agrees that it will
treat the Confidential Information of the other Parties with the same degree
of care with which it treats its own Confidential Information, but in no event
with less than a reasonable standard of care. Each Party agrees that it will
disclose the Confidential Information of a disclosing Party only to its and
its AffiliatesÂ’ respective members, shareholders, partners, directors,
officers, employees and attorneys who have a need-to-know such information,
and who have been informed of the proprietary and confidential nature thereof,
and who are under an obligation of confidentiality with respect thereto or
have agreed to be bound by confidentiality provisions at least as restrictive

consent in each instance of the disclosing Party (not to be unreasonably
withheld) provided, that Purchaser may disclose Confidential Information of a
disclosing Party to any consultants or actual or potential investors
(including any ratings agencies) in connection with providing financing of the
Facility or any of its assets, the purchase of the Company, or of the
operation of the Facility or any part thereof; and, provided that Sellers may
disclose Confidential Information to the parties to the Credit Facility to the
extent necessary to obtain the Lender Consent; provided, in each case, that
such persons agree to be bound by confidentiality provisions at least as
restrictive as those contained in this _Section 6.02_. Furthermore, each
Party agrees that it will use the Confidential Information of any other Party
solely for the purpose of carrying out this Agreement, and not to the
detriment of the disclosing Party or any of its Affiliates. Each Party shall
immediately notify the disclosing Party of any unauthorized disclosure or use
hereunder, and shall use all reasonable efforts necessary to prevent further
disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information of any
other Party shall not include any information that: (a) was furnished by such
Party prior this Agreement without restrictions; (b) was in the public domain
without fault or knowledge of the receiving Party prior to such disclosure;
(c) is received by either Party from a third party without restriction or
breach of any duty of confidentiality and without breach of this Agreement; or
(d) is independently developed by the receiving Party without reliance on the
Confidential Information of the disclosing Party. Notwithstanding and without
limiting the generality of this _Section 6.02(a)_, this _Section 6.02(a)_ is
subject to _Section 6.02(b)_ and a receiving Party may disclose Confidential
Information of a disclosing Party to the extent permitted under _Section
6.02(b)_. Sellers acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing, any
Confidential Information relating to the Company or the Project (other than
this Agreement and the terms hereof) shall be Confidential Information of
Purchaser and Company and not the Sellers or any of their Affiliates.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 6.02(a)_ the Parties
acknowledge that a receiving Party may be legally compelled to disclose
Confidential Information (or portions thereof): (i) pursuant to a valid
subpoena or other court process; (ii) at the express direction (including for
these purposes, as required by any statutes, rules or regulations of) any
properly authorized Governmental Authority or (iii) as necessary to obtain the
approval of any Governmental Authority to perform its obligations under this
Agreement. If a receiving Party in the opinion of legal counsel becomes
legally compelled pursuant to this _Section 6.02(b)_ to disclose any
Confidential Information of a disclosing Party as described in the preceding
sentence, the receiving Party will provide the disclosing Party with prompt
written notice thereof, including receiving PartyÂ’s determination thereof and
the nature, scope and contents of such legally compelled disclosure of such
Confidential Information (to the extent legally permissible), so that the
disclosing Party (A) may at the disclosing PartyÂ’s expense discuss and consult
with the receiving Party and its legal counsel regarding such legal compulsion
or requirement and the extent of the required disclosure and (B) may seek a
protective order or other appropriate remedy to prevent or limit the
disclosure arising from such legal compulsion or requirement. If,
notwithstanding any efforts pursuant to the preceding sentence, the receiving
Party is nonetheless, in the opinion of legal counsel, legally compelled to
disclose the Confidential Information to any tribunal or Governmental
Authority, the receiving Party will

disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that the receiving
Party is legally compelled to disclose, and the receiving Party will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the
Confidential Information, including by cooperating with the disclosing Party
and its counsel with respect to the disclosing PartyÂ’s efforts to obtain a
protective order (or other legal remedy) or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded any such Confidential Information.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Sections 6.02(a)_ and _6.02(b)_ , the
Parties acknowledge that each of the Parties or their respective Affiliates
may be subject to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") promulgated under the Securities Act of
1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or other rules or regulations of
any stock exchange upon which the securities of such Party or its Affiliates
are listed (" _Public Disclosure Rules_ ") that will compel such Party to
disclose Confidential Information). In addition, a receiving Party may be
compelled to submit Confidential Information to a Governmental Authority in
order to obtain approvals relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Wisconsin PSC Approval, approval of the Conversion
and recovery in rates of the receiving PartyÂ’s costs associated with this
Agreement, ownership and operation of the Project, and the Conversion. A Party
required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to this _Section
6.02(c)_ is referred to herein as the " _Public Disclosure Party_." In the
event of such legal compulsion arising in the opinion of such PartyÂ’s legal
counsel, the Public Disclosure Party shall promptly inform the other Parties
of its determination thereof and the nature, scope and contents of such
legally compelled disclosure of such Confidential Information. Prior to and
after its submission of documents with any Governmental Authority or stock
exchange pursuant to applicable Public Disclosure Rules or other disclosure
rules or requirements, the Public Disclosure Party will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of such Confidential
Information, including (A) providing to the other Parties drafts of any
disclosure document to be filed with the SEC or such stock exchange or other
Governmental Authority, (B) consulting with the other Parties with respect to
the contents thereof and the manner of filing or submission thereof (including
to the extent available, seeking confidential or non-public treatment of such
Confidential Information) and (C) cooperating with the other Parties and their
legal counsel with regard to such other PartiesÂ’ attempts to obtain a
protective order (or other legal remedy) to limit the disclosure of such
Confidential Information to the extent permitted under the Public Disclosure
Rules.

 



 

(d) Each Party shall promptly return to a disclosing Party, or verify the
destruction of all items containing or constituting Confidential Information
of such disclosing Party, together with all copies, extracts or summaries
thereof, upon the termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , that each Party
may retain one (1) copy of this Agreement in its legal archives for record
purposes; _provided further_ , that the provisions of this _Section 6.02_
shall continue to apply thereto.

 



 

(e) Each Party hereby acknowledges that any violation of this _Section 6.02_
will cause a disclosing Party immediate and irreparable harm that monetary
damages cannot adequately

remedy, and each Party agrees that, upon any actual, impending or threatened
breach or violation of this _Section 6.02_, the disclosing Party shall be
entitled to seek injunctive relief (without bond or proof of damages) and such
receiving Party agrees not plead in defense thereto that there would be an
adequate remedy at law.

 



 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 6.02_ shall survive for a period of three
(3) years after the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(g) Nothing in this _Section 6.02_ or otherwise in this Agreement is intended
to supersede or alter any obligations of any Party under any other
confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement between or among one or more
Parties and any Person that is not a Party.

 



 

SECTION 6.03 _No Other Contact_. Purchaser, its Affiliates and its
Representatives shall not contact or correspond with any customer, supplier,
contractor, vendor, employee or other Person associated with the Company, the
Project, the Company Assets, any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates,
without the prior written consent of each of the Sellers; provided, however
that so long as Purchaser is in compliance with its obligations under _Section
8.02(a)_, such contact or correspondence shall be permitted by Purchaser (x)
as a counterparty to any Contract with Company or with respect to the Project,
including the Existing Tolling Agreement or the New Tolling Agreement; (y) so
long as such contacts have been coordinated in all material respects with the
Sellers, in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; or (z) so long as such contacts and correspondence have
been coordinated in all material respects with the Sellers; provided further
that, nothing in this _Section 6.03_ shall prohibit Purchaser, its Affiliates
or its Representatives from contacting any such customer, supplier,
contractor, vendor, employee or other Person in connection with the operation
of the business of Purchaser, its Affiliates or its Representatives in the
ordinary course of PurchaserÂ’s business as PurchaserÂ’s business is conducted
without regard to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

real or personal property Taxes, the amount of such Taxes allocable to the
Pre-Closing Portion shall be equal to the amount of such property Taxes for
such Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the

business on the Closing Date (with exemptions, allowances or deductions that
are calculated on an annual basis including depreciation and amortization
deductions, being allocated to the Pre-Closing Portion based upon the number
of days in the Pre-Closing Portion relative to the number of days in such
Straddle Period).

 



 

(iv) Each Party shall cooperate in assuring that Taxes that are the
responsibility of Sellers pursuant to this _Section 7.03(a)_ are paid by

(60) days prior to the filing of a Tax Return of the Company for a Straddle
Period, Purchaser shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return to Sellers for their
review and comment. Sellers shall provide to Purchaser any comments Sellers
may have with respect to any such Tax Return within twenty (20) days of

an Independent Accounting Firm mutually agreed to Purchaser and Sellers shall
be final and binding on the Parties for all purposes and such Tax Return shall
be filed in a manner that is consistent with such determination. Not later
than thirty (30) days after filing any Tax Return of the Company for a
Straddle Period, Purchaser shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return as filed to
Sellers.

 



 

(iii) Sellers and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates and Representatives reasonably to cooperate, in
preparing and filing all Tax Returns, including maintaining and making
available to each other all records that are necessary for the preparation of
any Tax Returns that the other is required to file under this _Section 7.03_

Returns.

obligation with respect to such Tax Liabilities except to the extent such
failure materially impairs such SellerÂ’s ability to contest any such Tax
Liabilities.

 



 

(v) Subject to _Section 7.03(b)(vi)_, each Seller shall have the sole right
to represent the CompanyÂ’s interests in any Tax audit or administrative or
court proceeding relating solely to Tax Liabilities for which such Seller is
liable pursuant to _Section 7.03(a)_ and which relate to Pre-Closing Periods,
and to employ counsel of such SellerÂ’s choice at such SellerÂ’s expense;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such Seller shall have no right to represent the
CompanyÂ’s interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding
unless such Seller shall have first notified Purchaser in writing (i) of such
SellerÂ’s intention to do so and (ii) that such Seller agrees with Purchaser
that, as between Purchaser and such Seller, such Seller shall be liable for
any Taxes and Losses relating to Taxes that result from such audit or
proceeding; _provided_ , _further_ , that Purchaser and its Representatives
shall be permitted, at PurchaserÂ’s expense, to be present at, and participate
in, any such audit or proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the
prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned, neither of the Sellers nor any Affiliate of
either Seller shall be entitled to settle, either administratively or after
the commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes which could materially
adversely affect the liability for Taxes for which Purchaser is responsible
under _Section 7.03(a)_.

 



 

(vi) Sellers and Purchaser shall jointly control any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding relating to Tax Liabilities for a Straddle
Period, with any disputes as to the conduct of such audit or administrative or
court proceeding being resolved in the manner set forth as follows. The
objecting Party shall notify the other Party in writing of the area or areas
of disagreement. If the Parties are unable to resolve their dispute within
twenty (20) days, the matter shall be referred to a certified accountant or
tax attorney (" _Tax Advisor_ ") selected by both Parties. The decision of the
Tax Advisor shall be binding on all Parties. The Tax AdvisorÂ’s fees shall be
shared equally between Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser on the other
hand. No Party or its Affiliates shall take a position on any Tax Return, or
in any Tax audit or administrative or court, that is in any manner
inconsistent with such determination, without the prior written consent of the
other Party. Purchaser shall have the sole right to represent the CompanyÂ’s
interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to
Tax Liabilities other than any proceeding for a Straddle Period and any
proceeding in respect of which either Seller has the representation right
pursuant to _Section 7.03(b)(v)_ and to employ counsel of PurchaserÂ’s choice

consult and cooperate with the other Parties to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated hereby, as soon as reasonably practicable,
including the satisfaction of all conditions thereto set forth herein;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this shall in no way impair the PartiesÂ’
respective termination rights under _Section 13.01_. The Sellers and

therefor. The Sellers and Purchaser will provide the other with copies of all
written communications from Governmental Authorities relating to the approval
or disapproval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any Seller Regulatory Approval or Purchaser Regulatory Approval, as

with Purchaser and its Representatives in its development of PurchaserÂ’s
operational transition plan with regard to the Company and the Company Assets
(including the Project) and implementation thereof from and after the Closing
Date. Such commercially reasonable efforts of Sellers shall consist solely of
(i) causing the Company to provide access to and right to inspect the Project
and the Owned Real Property as Purchaser may reasonably request, (ii)
furnishing, and causing the Company to furnish access to such Representatives
of Sellers and the Company as Purchaser may reasonably request and (iii)
furnishing, and causing the Company to furnish, such financial and operating
data and information with respect to the Company as Purchaser may reasonably
request, in each case of clauses (i) through (iii) solely to the extent
reasonably related to PurchaserÂ’s development of its operational transition
plan and implementation thereof from and after the Closing Date; provided,
however, that any such investigation shall be subject to any applicable
confidentiality restrictions thereto or hereunder, and shall be conducted
during ordinary business hours upon reasonable advance notice to Sellers,
under supervision of SellersÂ’ or the CompanyÂ’s personnel and in a manner so as
not to interfere with the normal operations of the Company, including
compliance with safety and OSHA rules and other rules of conduct imposed by
the Company, its Affiliates or the operator of the Project, and Purchaser
shall have no right hereunder to perform invasive or subsurface investigation
of the Owned Real Property. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, none of Sellers or the Company (or any of their
respective Representatives) shall be required to disclose any information or
provide such access to Purchaser if such disclosure or access would, in the
SellersÂ’ sole discretion, (A) be repetitive or duplicative of information and
access previously provided, (B) involve disclosure of bids, letters of intent,
expressions of interest or other proposals received from third parties with
respect to the Transferred Interests or the Project, or the output of the
Project, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
otherwise, or of analyses or other information relating to such
communications, (C) cause significant competitive harm to Sellers, the Company
and their respective businesses if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not consummated, (D) jeopardize any attorney-client or other
privilege or (E) contravene any Applicable Law, any fiduciary duty or any
agreement binding on Sellers or the Company entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement. Without regard to _Article XII_, Purchaser shall indemnify,
defend, reimburse and hold harmless each of Sellers and their Representatives
from and against any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon
or against, any of them relating to, resulting from or arising out of the
access provided to Purchaser or its Representatives pursuant to this _Section
8.02(c)_, including any penalties or other Losses as a result of non-
compliance of safety rules and other applicable rules of conduct by Purchaser
or its Representatives. All requests for access and information by Purchaser
pursuant to this _Section 8.02(c)_ shall be submitted or directed exclusively
to PurEnergy, LLC (attention: Tom Murphy) or to such other entities or
individuals as Sellers may designate in writing from time to time. The Parties
understand and agree that the access and information to be requested by
Purchaser pursuant this _Section 8.02(c)_ after the date of this Agreement
shall be limited but will increase in frequency and in detail from and after
the date that is 60 days prior to the anticipated Closing Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, neither PurchaserÂ’s development or implementation of its
operational transition plan shall be a condition to Closing.

SECTION 8.03 _Public Announcements_. Without giving at least five (5) Business
DaysÂ’ prior notice and obtaining the prior written approval of each Seller (in
the case of a release or statement by Purchaser) or Purchaser and the other
Seller (in the case of a release or statement by a Seller), no Party will
issue, or permit any agent or Affiliate of such Party or the Company to issue
any press releases or otherwise make, or cause any agent or Affiliate of such
Party or the Company to make, any public statements with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or using the name of either
Seller or any Affiliate of either Seller (whether in connection with this
transaction or otherwise), except when such release or statement is deemed in
good faith by the releasing Party to be required by Applicable Law or any
Governmental Authority (including the PSCW), required to obtain an approval by
any Governmental Authority associated with this Agreement, the Project, or the
Conversion or under the applicable rules and regulations of a stock exchange
or market on which the securities of the releasing Party or any of its
Affiliates are listed. Specifically and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each Seller and Purchaser shall, to the maximum extent permitted by
the relevant Applicable Law, the relevant Governmental Authority (including
the PSCW) or the relevant rules and regulations of a stock exchange or market
on which the securities of the releasing Party or any of its Affiliates are
listed, redact from documents or otherwise protect the confidentiality of all
matters that constitute Confidential Information (including specifically the
financial terms of this Agreement and the CSA Management Agreement) when
participating in the proceedings and activities contemplated by _Section
8.06_. In each case to which such exception applies, the releasing Party will
use its reasonable efforts to provide a copy of such release or statement to
Purchaser (in the case of a release or statement by either Seller) or the
Sellers (in the case of a release or statement by Purchaser) and incorporate
any reasonable changes which are suggested by such Party or Parties prior to
releasing or making the statement.

 



 

SECTION 8.04 _Supplement to Schedules_

 



 

(a) Each Seller shall have the right prior to the Closing to supplement or
amend and deliver updates to the Disclosure Schedules with respect to any
matter which would have been required to be set forth on or described in such
Disclosure Schedules (a " _Disclosure Schedule Update_ "), whether on account
of any notice from Purchaser or under any other circumstance, but only to the
extent that such matter first arose or occurred, or relates to events, facts
or circumstances that first arose or occurred, after the date of the
Agreement, and each Seller shall provide Purchaser with any such Disclosure
Schedule Update as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later
than twenty (20) Business Days after SellersÂ’ Actual Knowledge of the nature
and extent of an event, fact or circumstance sufficient to require a
Disclosure Schedule Update. Purchaser shall obtain a title insurance
commitment for the title insurance policy described in _Section 9.02(f)_ and
a survey satisfying the requirements of _Section 9.02(g)_ no later than
ninety (90) days after the date of this Agreement and promptly provide Sellers
with copies of such title commitment and survey. Purchaser shall advise
Sellers if there are any items on such title commitment or survey to which
Purchaser objects no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date
of this Agreement. Purchaser shall obtain the Phase I report required by
_Section 9.02(i)_ no later than sixty (60) days after the date of this
Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS DOCUMENT. PORTIONS FOR

and promptly provide Sellers with copies of all drafts of such Phase I report
obtained pursuant to _Section 9.02(i)_ and the final report. Purchaser shall
advise Sellers if there are any items on such Phase I report to which
Purchaser objects no later than ninety (90) days after the date of this
Agreement. Seller shall have the right to update Schedule 4.02(n) based on the
results of such title commitment and survey and PurchaserÂ’s objections to any
items in such title commitment and survey (including any items that come
within the proviso of clause (f) of the definition of "Permitted Liens") and
_Schedule 4.02(i)_ based on the results of such Phase I report and
PurchaserÂ’s objections to any items in such Phase I report. Any Disclosure
Schedule Update shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgment or representation
that such Disclosure Schedule Update is material, to establish any standard of
materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of
this Agreement. In no event shall any Disclosure Schedule Update after the
date of this Agreement be deemed to cure any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty by either Seller in this Agreement as of the date
of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) If (i) Purchaser has the right to terminate the Agreement pursuant to
_Section 13.01(c)_ as a result of the breach of the representation and
warranty to which the Disclosure Schedule Update relates, so long as such
breach is not the result of fraud or intentional misconduct by the Sellers,
and (ii) Purchaser does not exercise such right within twenty (20) Business
Days of delivery of the Disclosure Schedule Update or the expiration of the
cure period under _Section 13.01(c)_, whichever is later, then, and only
then, such Disclosure Schedule Update will be deemed to have amended the
appropriate Schedule or Schedules as of the date of this Agreement, to have
qualified the representations and warranties as of the date of this Agreement,
and to have cured any misrepresentation or breach of warranty that otherwise
might have existed hereunder by reason of the existence of such matter, and
Purchaser shall not have any right to indemnity for such claims under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that with regard to any Disclosure
Schedule Update that results in the breach of the representation and warranty
to which such Disclosure Schedule Update relates and gives rise to PurchaserÂ’s
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 13.01(c)_, the Parties
may, in each of the PartiesÂ’ sole discretion, enter into such amendment or
supplement to this Agreement as may be necessary or desirable to address such
event or condition relating to such Disclosure Schedule Update for the
purposes of consummating the transactions contemplated herein on the Closing
Date. Any Disclosure Schedule Updates for which the foregoing conditions are
not satisfied shall not qualify the representations and warranties, or cure
any misrepresentation or breach of warranty hereunder for the purposes of
_Article IX_, _Article XII_, or _Section 13.01_.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 8.04_ to the contrary, in no
event shall any Disclosure Schedule Update from either Seller be deemed to
have amended any of the Excluded Update Schedules, to have qualified the
representations and warranties relating to any of the Excluded Update Schedule
as of the date of this Agreement, or to have cured any misrepresentation or
breach of warranty relating to any of the Excluded Update Schedules that
otherwise might have existed hereunder by reason of the existence of such
matter. The term " _Excluded Update Schedules_ " means _Schedules 1.01(b)_ ,
_1.01(c)_ (solely with respect to an increase in the amount of any item of
Seller Credit Support or the addition of any new Seller

_4.02(u)(i)_ , _8.01_ or _8.09_.

 



 

(d) Purchaser shall be permitted to update _Schedule 5.01(e)_ , except with
respect to clause (i) of _Section 5.01(e)_, and _Schedule 5.01(f)_ in the
same manner as Sellers are permitted to update their schedules under _Section
8.04(a)_. In the event that Purchaser updates such schedules, Sellers shall
have the rights and obligations of Purchaser, _mutatis mutandis_ , under
_Section 8.04(b)_ with respect to such updates, and Purchaser shall have the
rights and obligations of Sellers, _mutatis mutandis_ , under _Section
8.04(b)_ with respect to such updates.

 



 

SECTION 8.05 _Further Assurances_. The Sellers and Purchaser each agree that
from time to time after the Closing Date and at the prior written request of
the other Parties, they will execute and deliver such further instruments, and
take such other action, as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the
purposes and intents of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 8.06 _Regulatory and Other Authorizations and Consents_.

 



 

(a) _Filings_. Each Party shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain (and each of the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
consult and cooperate with the other Parties so that such Parties can obtain)
all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of, give all notices to and

pertaining to the Purchaser Regulatory Approvals and the Seller Regulatory
Approvals (including, without limitation, the FERC Approval, the Wisconsin PSC
Approval, the Permits and the expiration of or termination of all applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act (as described in _Section 9.02(d)_), if
applicable)) and third parties that may be or become necessary for its
execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations under, this
Agreement and will cooperate fully with the other Parties in promptly seeking
to obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders and approvals, giving such
notices and making such filings. To the extent required by either of the FERC
under the FPA, the HSR Act, or the Wisconsin PSC Approval, each Party shall
(i) file or cause to be filed, as promptly as practicable, with the FERC,
Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Justice, or the
PSCW, as applicable, all reports and other documents required to be filed by
such Party concerning the transactions contemplated hereby, and it is in the
intention of each Party to make all initial filings in respect of the
Wisconsin PSC Approval not later than 10 Business Days after the date of this
Agreement, and (ii) promptly comply with or cause to be complied with any
requests by either the FERC, Federal Trade Commission, the United States
Department of Justice, or the PSCW, as applicable, for additional information
concerning such transactions. Each of the Parties shall have the right, to the

unreasonably withheld) in advance all information relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby and such Party which appear in any application, notice,
petition or filing made by or on behalf of the other Parties in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, and each Party agrees and

(b) _Additional Undertakings of the Parties_. Without limiting the generality
of the undertakings pursuant to _Section 8.06(a)_, Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts (i) to eliminate any concerns on the part of
any Governmental Authority regarding the legality under any Applicable Law of
PurchaserÂ’s acquisition of the Transferred Interests, and (ii) if an
injunction or order has been issued in a judicial or administrative proceeding
that would make consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement unlawful or that would prevent or delay such consummation, to take
such commercially reasonable efforts as such Party determines to be
appropriate under the circumstances to attempt to vacate, modify or suspend
such injunction or order so as to permit the transactions contemplated hereby
to be consummated on a time schedule as close as possible to that contemplated
by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall have no
obligation to provide any consideration to any Governmental Authority or other
third-party, to sell or dispose of any assets or lines of business, or to
agree to the terms of any agreement or consent decree that is materially
adverse to the interests of the Sellers and the Purchaser.

 



 

(c) _Third Party Consents_. Each Seller will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, and Purchaser will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to assist each Seller in obtaining, any consents of third parties and
Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither Purchaser nor any Seller shall have any obligation to pay any
consideration to any Governmental Authority or other third-party to obtain any
such consents. In addition, each Seller shall keep Purchaser reasonably
apprised of its efforts to obtain necessary consents and waivers from third
parties and the responses of such third parties to such SellerÂ’s request to
provide such consents and waivers. Without limiting the generality of the
forgoing, within five (5) Business Days after the date hereof, Sellers will
submit to the Administrative Agent (as such term is defined in the Credit
Agreement) a written request for the Lender Consent. Until Sellers have
obtained the Lender Consent, no provision of this Agreement will be effective
to the extent that such provision would constitute a breach of the Credit
Agreement or Loan Documents (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Without
limiting the generality of this _Section 8.06(c)_ or of _Section 8.06(a)_,
Sellers will not influence any Affiliate of either Seller to refuse to approve
the Lender Consent.

 



 

(d) _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses, including fees and expenses of counsel,
financial advisors and accountants, incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring
such fee or expense, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred. Purchaser
shall be obligated to pay any and all costs of any audit of the Company as may
be required to enable Purchaser to complete and file any filing by Purchaser
or an Affiliate of Purchaser with any Governmental Authority (other than any
audit of the Company as Sellers have historically obtained in the ordinary
course of the business, including the annual audited financial statements of
Company). All filing fees incurred in connection with any filing made pursuant
to the HSR Act shall be paid [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED].

Representatives not to, initiate or solicit, directly or indirectly, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal with respect to, engage in
negotiations concerning, provide any confidential information or data to any
Person with respect to, have any discussions with any Person (except with

the meaning of Section 1313(a)(1) or (2) of the Code.

 



 

(d) _Exceptions_. The limitations set forth in _Sections 12.03(a)_ and
_12.03(b)_ shall not apply in instances of fraud or intentional misconduct on
the part of either Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, or to any breach of the
representations and warranties by Sellers set forth in _Sections 4.01(a)_
(Organization), _4.01(c)_ (Authority), _4.01(d)_ (Enforceability), _4.01(e)_
(Transferred Interests), _4.01(h)_ (Brokers), _4.02(a)_ (Organization),
_4.02(b)_ (Qualification), _4.02(c)_ (Capitalization), or _4.02(r)(i)_
(Title to Company Assets) (the " _Specified_ _Representations_ "), which
instances or breaches shall instead be subject to the following limitation:
(i) in no event shall Sellers ever be required to indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties (including pursuant to _Section 12.01(a)_, _12.01(b)_
(other than with respect to SellersÂ’ respective obligations to convey the
Transferred Interests pursuant to _Section 2.01_) or _Section 12.10_) for
Losses in any amount exceeding, in the aggregate, the greater of (y) the
Termination Amount _plus_ the Purchase Price _minus_ the Credit Facility

REQUESTED], nor (ii) shall either Seller individually be required to indemnify
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in any amount exceeding [CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT REQUESTED] of the greater of the foregoing clauses (y) and (z).

 



 

(e) [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED].

 



 

SECTION 12.04 _Indemnity Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Procedure for Third-Party Claims_.

 



 

(i) _Notice of Claim_. If a claim by a third party is made against a Seller
Indemnified Party or a Purchaser Indemnified Party (any such indemnified
party, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), and if such Indemnified Party intends to
seek indemnity with respect thereto under this _Article XII_, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly furnish written notice of such claim (in
reasonable detail and including the factual basis for such claim and, to the
extent known, the amount thereof) to the Party against whom indemnity is
sought (such Party, in such capacity, the " _Indemnifying Party_ ").
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party will deliver to the Indemnifying Party,
promptly after the Indemnified PartyÂ’s receipt thereof, copies of all material
notices and documents (including court papers) received or transmitted by the
Indemnified Party relating to such claim. The failure or delay of the
Indemnified Party to deliver prompt written notice of a claim shall not affect
the indemnity obligations of the Indemnifying Party hereunder, except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party was actually disadvantaged by such failure or
delay in delivery of notice of such claim.

 



 

(ii) _Conduct of Claim_. The Indemnifying Party shall have ten (10) days after
receipt of such notice to elect to undertake, conduct and control (through
counsel of its own choosing and at its own expense), and, in any event, shall
have the right to participate (at its own expense) in the settlement or
defense of such claim, and the Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate
with it in connection therewith. If the Indemnifying Party timely elects to
undertake, conduct and control the settlement or defense of such claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate in such
settlement or defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party (but
the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such Indemnified
Party). So long as the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s cost
and expense, (i) has undertaken the defense of, and assumed full
responsibility for all indemnified liabilities with respect to, such claim,
(ii) is contesting such claim in good faith through appropriate proceedings
and (iii) has taken such action (including the posting of a bond, deposit or
other security) as may be necessary to prevent any action to foreclose a Lien
against or attachment of the property of the Indemnified Party for payment of
such claim, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
pay or settle any such claim if it has waived in writing any right to
indemnity by the Indemnifying Party for such claim; and, _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, if within ten (10) days of such notice from the Indemnified
Party, the

WHICH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS REQUESTED ARE DENOTED BY [CONFIDENTIAL

Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that it elects (at
the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s cost and expense) to undertake the defense thereof
and assume full responsibility for all indemnified liabilities with respect
thereto, or gives such notice and thereafter fails to contest such claim in
good faith or to prevent action to foreclose a Lien against or attachment of
the Indemnified PartyÂ’s property as contemplated above, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right, at the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s expense, to contest, settle
or compromise such claim and the Indemnified Party shall not thereby waive any
right to indemnity for such claim under this Agreement.

 



 

(iii) _Limitations on Settlement_. No Indemnifying Party will consent to any
settlement, compromise or discharge (including the consent to entry of any
judgment) of any such claim without the Indemnified PartyÂ’s prior written
consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
_provided_ , that, if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such
claim, the Indemnified Party will agree to any settlement, compromise or
discharge of such claim which the Indemnifying Party may recommend and which
by its terms obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of Losses
in connection with such claim and releases the Indemnified Party and its
Affiliates from liability in connection with such claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnified Party may refuse to agree to any such
settlement, compromise or discharge (x) that provides for injunctive or other
non-monetary relief affecting the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
or (y) that, in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnified Party, would
otherwise adversely affect the Indemnified Party. Whether or not the
Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of such claim, the
Indemnified Party will not admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge (including the consent to entry of any judgment with
respect to), any such claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

 



 

(b) _Procedure for Other Claims_. Any claim on account of Losses for which
indemnification is provided under this Agreement, which does not involve a
claim of a third party, will be asserted by written notice (setting forth in
reasonable detail the facts or circumstances that allegedly give rise to such
claim and, to the extent known, the amount thereof) given by the Indemnified
Party to the Indemnifying Party from whom such indemnification is sought,
which notice shall be given promptly after such Indemnified Party obtains
actual knowledge of the existence of such claim. The failure or delay of the
Indemnified Party to deliver prompt written notice of a claim shall not affect
the indemnity obligations of the Indemnifying Party hereunder, except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party was actually disadvantaged by such failure or
delay in delivery of notice of such claim.

 



 

(c) _Subrogation_. In the event of payment in full by an Indemnifying Party to
any Indemnified Party in connection with any claim (an " _Indemnified Claim_
"), such Indemnifying Party will be subrogated to and will stand in the place
of such Indemnified Party as to any events or circumstances in respect of
which such Indemnified Party may have any right or claim

relating to such Indemnified Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting
such Indemnified Claim or against any other Person. Such Indemnified Party
will cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the
cost and expense of such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated
right or claim.

 



 

SECTION 12.05 _Survival and Time Limitation_. The terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall survive the Closing of the transactions contemplated
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Closing, any claim by any
Purchaser Indemnified Party that either Seller is liable to such Purchaser
Indemnified Party under the terms of this Agreement for breach of any
representations or warranties of such Seller must be made in writing and given
to such Seller (or not at all) on or prior to the date that is [CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT REQUESTED] after the Closing Date, except that (a) any claims for
breach of the Specified Representations shall survive the Closing
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED], (b) any claims for breach of the
representations and warranties in _Sections 4.02(j)_ (Taxes) and _4.02(k)_
(Employee Benefits) shall survive the Closing until the date that is
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] past the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations, and (c) there shall be no such time limitation or
survival period for any fraud or intentional misconduct.

 



 

SECTION 12.06 _Further Indemnity Limitations_.

 



 

(a) _Insurance Proceeds_. The amount of any indemnifiable Losses shall be
reduced to the extent of any (i) insurance proceeds actually received by such
Indemnified Party with respect to such Loss _less_ any self insurance
retention amount, deductibles paid and any reasonably foreseeable increases in
premiums, in each case relating to such Losses and (ii) any payment actually
received by an Indemnified Party from a third party with respect to such Loss.

 



 

(b) _Mitigation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
upon becoming aware of a Loss for which it seeks indemnification the
Indemnified Party will take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate all
Losses relating to a claim, including availing itself of any defenses,
limitations, rights of contribution, claims against third Persons and other
rights at law or equity, and will provide such evidence and documentation of
the nature and extent of the claim as may be reasonably requested by the
Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(c) _Materiality_. For purposes of determining the amount of Losses resulting
from a breach of a representation, warranty, or covenant under this Agreement
(but not for the purpose of determining whether or not such representation,
warranty, or covenant has been breached for the purposes of _Sections 12.01_
and _12.02_ ), the amount of such Losses shall be determined without reference
to any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualification in such
representation, warranty, or covenant.

 



 

SECTION 12.07 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, the
indemnification provisions of this _Article XII_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of each Party (including the Seller Indemnified Parties and
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties) (i) for any breach of any PartyÂ’s
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this

Agreement or (ii) otherwise with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby with respect to the Company, other than in the case of (i)
and (ii) instances of fraud or intentional misconduct or claims for non-
monetary relief with respect to the enforcement of _Section 6.02_ or _8.03_.
In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted under Applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes
of action it may have against another Party hereunder or under Applicable Law
with respect to the claims described in clauses (i) and (ii) above, other than
instances of fraud or intentional misconduct or claims for non-monetary relief
with respect to the enforcement of _Section 6.02_ or _8.03_.

 



 

SECTION 12.08 _Waiver of Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Sellers and Purchaser agree that the recovery
by any Indemnified Party of any damages suffered or incurred by such
Indemnified Party as a result of any breach by another Party of any of its
obligations under this Agreement shall be limited to the Losses suffered or
incurred by an Indemnified Party as a result of the breach by the breaching
Party of its obligations hereunder. Except with respect to any third party
claims against the Indemnified Party and in instances of fraud or intentional
misconduct, in no event shall the breaching Party be liable to an Indemnified
Party for any indirect, consequential, special, exemplary or punitive damages.

 



 

SECTION 12.09 _Additional Limitations._

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, this _Article XII_, including _Section 12.07_,
shall have no application with respect to claims between Fox OP and Fox River.

 



 

SECTION 12.10 _Special Indemnity._

 



 

Prior to Closing, Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
and deliver to Purchaser (a) a fully executed copy of [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
REQUESTED] described in [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] 3 on Schedule
4.02(n), and (b) an assignment instrument [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]
pursuant to which the original grantor assigned the [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
REQUESTED] described in [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] 11 on Schedule
4.02(n) [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] to the current grantor under the
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED], and an estoppel certificate or similar
written assurance executed by the current grantor under the [CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT REQUESTED] in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]. In the event that Sellers obtain and
deliver the [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED], the [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
REQUESTED] or the [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] prior to Closing, and any
of such are not reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, then Purchaser shall have
the right to terminate this Agreement by notice to Sellers. ** **In the event
Sellers fail to obtain and deliver to Purchaser the [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
REQUESTED], ** ** the [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] or the [CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT REQUESTED] ** ** on or prior to the Closing Date, from and after the
Closing, each Seller shall indemnify, defend, reimburse and hold harmless the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, on a several and not a joint basis, from and
against any and all reasonable Losses actually

incurred by any Purchaser Indemnified Party, acting consistent with Prudent
Industry Practices and in a manner consistent with the actions of such
Purchaser Indemnified Party or other utilities acting under similar
circumstances, as a result of, in connection with, relating to or arising out
of (y) failure of Company to hold a [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] for
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] 3 on Schedule 4.02(n), with no further
consideration due, and otherwise on terms substantially similar to the
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] for [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] 5 on
Schedule 4.02(n) (in the event that Sellers fail to deliver the [CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT REQUESTED] prior to the Closing Date), or (z) assignment to the
current grantor of the [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] having caused or
resulting in a material change in terms or termination of the [CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT REQUESTED] (in the event that Sellers fail to deliver the
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] prior to the Closing Date), or any Company
monetary breach or default under the [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] (in
the event that Sellers fail to deliver the [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]
prior to the Closing Date). The foregoing indemnity shall be effective
notwithstanding any disclosures in the Disclosure Schedules as of the date of
this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XIII _ 

_**

 

 ** _TERMINATION AND REMEDIES_**

 



 

SECTION 13.01 _Termination of Agreement_. No Party may terminate this
Agreement if the event allowing termination is the result of such PartyÂ’s
material breach of this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

 



 

(a) by the mutual written consent of each Seller and Purchaser;

 



 

(b) by either Seller, if (i) Purchaser fails to comply with any of its
covenants or agreements contained herein, or breaches any of its
representations and warranties contained herein, which failure to comply or
breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after receipt by Purchaser from
either Seller of written notice of such failure to comply or breach, and such
failure to comply or breach would result in a failure to satisfy the
conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 9.01_, or (ii) any of the
Purchaser Regulatory Approvals, the Seller Regulatory Approvals and the FERC
Approval shall have been obtained on terms and conditions that are materially
adverse to the interests of either of the Sellers;

 



 

(c) by Purchaser, if (i) either Seller fails to comply with any of its
covenants or agreements contained herein, or breaches any of its
representations and warranties contained herein, which failure to comply or
breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Sellers from
Purchaser written notice of such failure to comply or breach, and such failure
to comply or breach would result in a failure to satisfy the conditions to
Closing set forth in _Section 9.02_; or (ii) any of the Purchaser Regulatory
Approvals (except the Purchaser Regulatory Approval contemplated by clause (2)
of the definition of "Wisconsin PSC Approval"), the Seller

Regulatory Approvals and the FERC Approval shall have been obtained on terms
and conditions that are materially adverse to the interests of Purchaser;

 



 

(d) by either Seller or Purchaser, if a Governmental Authority shall have
issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (which order,
decree or ruling the parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to lift), which permanently restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and which order, decree,
ruling or other action is not subject to appeal;

 



 

(e) by Purchaser or either Seller, notice to the others, at any time if
Closing does not occur on or before December 28, 2013 (the " _Closing
Deadline_ ");

 



 

(f) by Purchaser, if [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED], and the same is not
cured (including by [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED], as reasonably
determined by Purchaser) within thirty (30) days after receipt by the
applicable Seller from Purchaser of written notice specifying particularly
such decline, and such decline would result in a failure to satisfy the
conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 9.02(e)_;

 



 

(g) by Purchaser, if by November 1, 2012, the Lender Consent has not been
obtained;

 



 

(h) by either Seller, if Purchaser terminates the New Tolling Agreement in
accordance with its terms; or

 



 

(i) by Purchaser, as set forth in _Section 12.10_.

 



 

SECTION 13.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by a Seller or Purchaser pursuant to _Section 13.01_, written
notice thereof shall promptly be given by the terminating Party to the other
Parties, and this Agreement shall thereupon terminate. Following any such
termination, Purchaser and the Sellers will continue to be bound by their
obligations set forth in _Sections 6.02_, _8.03_ and _8.06(d)_ , _Sections
12.08_ and _13.03(d)_ and _Article XIV_. If this Agreement is terminated as
provided herein, (a) all filings, applications and other submissions made to
any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent practicable, be withdrawn from
the Governmental Authority to which they were made, and (b) for the avoidance
of doubt, the Existing Tolling Agreement and New Tolling Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 



 

SECTION 13.03 _Remedies_.

 



 

(a) _Seller Remedies_. Upon the failure by Purchaser to fulfill any
undertaking or commitment provided for herein on the part of Purchaser that is
required to be fulfilled on or prior to the Closing Date, each Seller, at its
sole option, may (i) enforce specific performance of this Agreement or (ii)
pursue any rights or remedies available at law or in equity.

(b) _Purchaser Remedies_. Upon the failure by a Seller to fulfill any
undertaking or commitment provided for herein on the part of such Seller that
is required to be fulfilled on or prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser, as its
sole option, may (i) enforce specific performance of this Agreement or (ii)
pursue any rights or remedies available at law or in equity.

 



 

(c) _Election of Remedies_. If any Party elects to pursue singularly any right
or remedy available to it under this _Article XIII_, then unless this
Agreement expressly provides that such remedy is the PartyÂ’s sole remedy, such
Party may at any time thereafter cease pursuing that right or remedy and elect
to pursue any other right or remedy available to it under this _Article
XIII_. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, all rights and remedies
hereunder shall be cumulative. Except as otherwise provided by Applicable Law,
no delay or forbearance by a Party in the exercise or enforcement of any right
or remedy hereunder shall be deemed a waiver by such Party of its right
hereunder to exercise or enforce such right or remedy.

 



 

(d) _Remedies after Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 13.01_, there shall be no liability for
damages on the part of a Party to another under and by reason of this
Agreement except for any intentional or willful breach of or intentional or
willful failure to perform under this Agreement, the remedies for which shall
not be limited by the provisions of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that obligations of the Parties in _Sections 6.02_ , _8.03_ and _8.06(d)_ ,
_Sections 12.08_ and _13.03(d)_ and _Article XIV_, shall survive
termination of this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XIV**

 

 ** **

 

 ** _OTHER PROVISIONS_**

 



 

SECTION 14.01 _Seller Liability_. The Parties hereby recognize and agree that,
even where not otherwise explicitly stated in this Agreement, the liability of
each Seller under this Agreement (including with respect to the
indemnification provisions contained in _Article XII_) is intended to be
several, and not joint, with [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] of any such
liabilities; provided, however that this _Section 14.01_ shall have no
application with respect to (i) breaches of this Agreement by one Seller only,
in which case only such Seller shall have liability hereunder, and (ii)
breaches of any representation and warranties made only by one Seller under
_Article IV_, in which case only the Seller breaching the representations and
warranty shall have liability hereunder. Representations and Warranties under
Section 4.01 relating to Fox OP are made by Fox OP only, and not by Fox River;
and Representations and Warranties under _Section 4.01_ relating to Fox River
are made by Fox River only and not Fox OP. Representations and Warranties
under _Section 4.02_ that are made to SellersÂ’ Knowledge or SellersÂ’ Actual
Knowledge and are inaccurate shall be deemed to have been breached by both
Sellers even though only one Seller had SellersÂ’ Knowledge or SellersÂ’ Actual
Knowledge.

 



 

SECTION 14.02 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by means of telecopied signature pages), all of which,
taken together,

shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective
when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and
delivered to the other Parties.

 



 

SECTION 14.03 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the rights and obligations
of the Parties hereunder and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
governed by, enforced and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State
of Wisconsin without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. Each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of
any court of the State of Wisconsin located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and any
federal court located in the Eastern District of Wisconsin with respect to any
proceeding relating to this Agreement. Further, each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection or defense that it may
have based on improper venue or forum non conveniens to the conduct of any
such proceeding in any such courts. The Parties agree that any or all of them
may file a copy of this paragraph with any court as written evidence of the
knowing, voluntary and bargained agreement between the Parties irrevocably to
waive any objections to venue or to convenience of forum. Each of the Parties
agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding will be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Applicable Law.

 



 

SECTION 14.04 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Schedules and
Exhibits hereto contain the entire agreement between the Parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof and supersede any prior written or oral
agreements, understandings, representations or warranties between the Parties.

 



 

SECTION 14.05 _Notices_. All notices hereunder shall be sufficiently given for
all purposes hereunder if in writing and delivered personally, sent by
documented overnight delivery service or, to the extent receipt is confirmed,

will relieve the assigning or designating party of its obligations hereunder.
Subject to this _Section 14.06_ , this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their successors and assigns.

 



 

(b) Purchaser may assign, including by operation of law, its rights and
obligations under this Agreement to (i) any Affiliate of Purchaser upon prior
written notice to the Sellers or (ii) Financing Parties as collateral security
to such Financing Parties, as more fully set forth in _Section 14.06(c)_
below; provided that any such assignment under (i) or (ii) shall not relieve
Purchaser of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) In connection with any collateral assignment by Purchaser of this
Agreement to Financing Parties as set forth in _Section 14.07(b)_ above,
Sellers agree to enter into an agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Sellers directly with the Financing Parties and Purchaser
under which Sellers shall consent to such assignment and will agree to other
customary and reasonable provisions for the benefit of the Financing Parties,
including, without limitation, reasonable provisions under which the Financing
Parties or their designees (i) may assume or transfer the rights of Purchaser
under this Agreement, (ii) shall be entitled to receive from Sellers copies of
certain notices relating to breaches by the Purchaser and other similar
matters hereunder that Sellers might provide to Purchaser, (iii) obtain
SellersÂ’ agreement, subject to any rights Sellers may have hereunder,
including any right of offset, to make all payments due to Purchaser under
this Agreement to an account designated by the Financing Parties and (iv)
shall be provided other customary or related benefits or protections as
reasonably requested by the Financing Parties to support such financing (not
including in any event amendments to the Company Contracts), in each case
reasonably acceptable to Sellers and at no actual cost to Sellers.

 



 

SECTION 14.07 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be modified or
amended except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by each of
the Parties. The Sellers may together waive compliance by Purchaser, and
Purchaser may waive compliance by the Sellers, with any term or provision of
this Agreement on the part of such Party or Parties to be performed or
complied with, only by an instrument in writing. The waiver by a Party of a
breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a
waiver of any subsequent breach.

 



 

SECTION 14.08 _Schedules and Exhibits_. All Schedules and Exhibits hereto that
are referred to herein are hereby made a part hereof and incorporated herein
by such reference. Information set forth in the Schedules is included solely
for informational purposes, is not an admission of liability with respect to
the matters covered by the information, and may not be required to be
disclosed, pursuant to this Agreement. The specification of any dollar amount
in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the
inclusion of any specific item in the Schedules is not intended to imply that
such amounts (or higher or lower amounts) are or are not material, and no
Party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the
inclusion of any such item in the Schedules in any claim, dispute or
controversy as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein

material for purposes of this Agreement. Any disclosure in a particular
Schedule shall be deemed and understood to be disclosure in each other
Schedule to which the applicability of such disclosure is readily apparent on
its face, notwithstanding reference to a specific Section or paragraph of this
Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 14.09 _Agreement for the Parties Â’ Benefit Only_. Except as specified
in _Article XII_ , which is also intended to benefit and, to be enforceable by
the Seller Indemnified Parties and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, as
applicable, this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person not a
party hereto, other than the PartiesÂ’ successors or permitted assigns, any
rights or remedies hereunder, and no Person, other than the Parties, their
successors or permitted assigns, is entitled to rely on any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein.

 



 

SECTION 14.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
shall be held invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any
Applicable Law or public policy by a court of competent jurisdiction, all
other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to a Party. Upon such determination by a court of competent
jurisdiction that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable
of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to give effect to the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



 

SECTION 14.11 _Time of Essence; Action on Business Day_. Time is of the
essence in this Agreement. If the date specified in this Agreement for giving
any notice or taking any action is not a Business Day (or if the period during
which any notice is required to be given or any action taken expires on a date
that is not a Business Day), then the date for giving such notice or taking
such action (and the expiration date of such period during which notice is
required to be given or action taken) shall be the next day which is a
Business Day.

 



 

SECTION 14.12 _Construction of Agreement_. This Agreement and any documents or
instruments delivered pursuant hereto shall be construed without regard to the
identity of the Person who drafted the various provisions of the same. Each
and every provision of this Agreement and such other documents and instruments
shall be construed as though the Parties participated equally in the drafting
of the same. Consequently, the Parties acknowledge and agree that any rule of
construction that a document is to be construed against the drafting party
shall not be applicable either to this Agreement or such other documents and
instruments.
