 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of October 30,
2019, is by and among CDandR Arrow Parent, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company ("Parent"), CDandR Arrow Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Anixter International
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

BACKGROUND

A. The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have approved the merger (the "Merger") of Merger Sub with and into the
Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, whereby each issued share of common stock, par value $1.00 per
share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") not owned by Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company shall be converted into the right to receive cash in the
amount set forth in Section 2.01(c) (Conversion of Company Common Stock).

B. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and material inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this
Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company have entered into a voting and
support agreement in favor of Parent, whereby such stockholders have agreed to
vote in favor of, and support the consummation of, the Transactions (the
"Voting Agreement"), on the terms and conditions set forth therein.

C. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to
prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

AGREEMENT

Accordingly, intending to be legally bound, the parties hereby agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

The Merger

SECTION 1.01The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law
(the "DGCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the
Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). The Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are referred to herein as the
"Transactions".

SECTION 1.02Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at the offices of Sidley Austin LLP, 787 7th Avenue, New York, NY 10019,
at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the third (3rd) Business Day following
the date on which each of the conditions set forth in Article VII is satisfied
or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived by the party entitled to waive such
condition (except in any such case for any conditions that by their nature can
be satisfied only on the Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction of such
conditions or waiver by the party entitled to waive such conditions) or such
other time and location as mutually agreed by Parent and the Company in
writing; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the
Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article VII except in any such case for any
conditions that by their nature can be satisfied only on the Closing Date, but
subject to the satisfaction of such conditions or waiver by the party entitled
to waive such conditions, the Closing shall occur on the earlier of (a) any
date during the Marketing Period that may be specified by Parent on no fewer than three (3) Business Days' notice to
the Company (unless a shorter period shall be agreed to by Parent and the
Company) and (b) the third (3rd) Business Day following the final day of the
Marketing Period subject, in each case, to the satisfaction or waiver of the
obligations of the Parties set forth in Article VII (except in any such case
for any conditions that by their nature can be satisfied only on the Closing
Date, but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions or waiver by the
party entitled to waive such conditions). The date on which the Closing occurs
is referred to herein as the "Closing Date".

SECTION 1.03Effective Time. Before the Closing, the Company shall prepare, and
on the Closing Date the Company shall file with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, a certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (in
any such case, the "Certificate of Merger") executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State, or at such
other time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the
"Effective Time").

SECTION 1.04Effects. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement, the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the Certificate of
Merger.

SECTION 1.05Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws.

(a)The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended at the Effective Time to read in the form of Exhibit A, and, as so
amended, such Certificate of Incorporation shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by Law.

(b)The By-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by Law.

SECTION 1.06Directors. The directors of Merger Sub immediately before the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

SECTION 1.07Officers. Except as may be specified by Parent prior to the
Effective Time, the officers of the Company immediately before the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.



ARTICLE II



Effect on the Capital Stock of the

Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates



SECTION 2.01Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

a.Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

b.Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Each share of Company
Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no Merger Consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor. c.Conversion of Company Common Stock.

1.Subject to Section 2.01(b) (Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned
Stock) and Section 2.01(d) (Appraisal Rights), each issued and outstanding
share of Company Common Stock held by stockholders of the Company shall be
converted into the right to receive $81.00 in cash (the "Merger
Consideration").

2.As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer
be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate or certificates representing any such
shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive Merger Consideration,
without interest, upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with
Section 2.02 (Exchange of Certificates).

d.Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares ("Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time and that are held by any
Person who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who has otherwise complied in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") as of such time shall not be
converted into Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c) (Conversion
of Company Common Stock), but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be
entitled to payment of the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance
with Section 262; provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of
such holder's Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have
become exchangeable solely for, the right to receive Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.01(c) (Conversion of Company Common Stock), without
interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demand
for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands
and any other documents or instruments, in each case, received by the Company
related to Section 262 or stockholder demands or claims thereunder. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or negotiate, settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Parent shall
have the right, at Parent's sole expense, to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.

e.Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately and equitably adjusted,
without duplication; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 2.01(e)
shall be construed to permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any
other Person to take any action that is otherwise prohibited by Section 5.01.

f.Withholding. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Company and the
Surviving Corporation will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted
or withheld therefrom pursuant to any Law in respect of Taxes. Any such
amounts so deducted or withheld shall be paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Entity and, to the extent such amounts are timely paid to the
appropriate Governmental Entity, treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been
paid in satisfaction of the corresponding obligations hereunder.

SECTION 2.02Exchange of Certificates.

a.Exchange Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or
cause to be deposited with a bank or trust company designated by the Company
and reasonably acceptable to Parent (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the
Exchange Agent, sufficient funds for the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (the "Exchange Fund"). In the event
the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payment of the aggregate
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c), Parent shall promptly
deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Exchange Agent in
an amount sufficient to make such payments. Funds made available to the
Exchange Agent shall be invested by the Exchange Agent, as directed by the
Surviving Corporation, in direct short-term obligations of, or direct short-
term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United
States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days, pending
payment thereof by the Exchange Agent to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01(c); provided, however, that no
investment of such deposited funds shall relieve Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent from promptly making the payment of the
aggregate Merger Consideration as required by Section 2.01(c), and following
any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common
Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, in the amount of such
losses, which additional funds will be held and disbursed in the same manner
as funds initially deposited with the Exchange Agent for payment of the
aggregate Merger Consideration to such holders of Company Common Stock. Parent
shall direct the Exchange Agent to hold the Exchange Fund for the benefit of
such holders of Company Common Stock and to make payments from the Exchange
Fund in accordance with this Section 2.02. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any purpose other than to fund payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c).

b.Exchange Procedures. The Surviving Corporation shall instruct the Exchange
Agent to mail, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, to
each holder of record of Certificates that immediately before the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.01(c) (Conversion of Company Common Stock), (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancelation to the Exchange Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Company, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash that the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by
such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01(c)
(Conversion of Company Common Stock) into the right to receive, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and shares may be issued
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered
is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.02(c) (No Further
Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock), until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to Section
2.01(c) (Conversion of Company Common Stock). No interest shall be paid or
accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

c.No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of Section 2.01(c) upon
conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately before the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any certificates formerly representing shares of Company
Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

d.Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
the proceeds of any investment thereof) that remains undistributed to the
holders of Company Common Stock for one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holder of Company
Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for payment of its
claim for Merger Consideration.

e.No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been
surrendered before such date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity,
any such cash in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

f.Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate any cash that would be
payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

g.Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Surviving Corporation in
accordance with Section 2.02(a) (Exchange Agent), on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the
Surviving Corporation.

h.Uncertificated Shares. In the case of any outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock that are not represented by Certificates, the parties shall make
such adjustments to this Section 2.02 as are necessary or appropriate to
implement the same purpose and effect that this Section 2.02 has with respect
to shares of Company Common Stock that are represented by Certificates.

SECTION 2.03Treatment of Company Options, Restricted Stock Units and Equity
Plans.

a.Treatment of Company Options. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board
(or, if appropriate, a duly authorized committee thereof) shall adopt
appropriate resolutions as are necessary to provide that, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan (the "Company Options") shall
be fully vested and canceled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any
such canceled Company Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of
the cancelation of such Company Option and in full settlement therefor, a
payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such canceled Company Option and
(ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such canceled Company
Option, without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the "Option
Payments"); provided, however, that any such Company Option with respect to
which the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject thereto is
greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration shall be canceled in
exchange for no consideration. From and after the Effective Time, no Company
Option shall be exercisable, and each Company Option shall entitle the holder
thereof only to the payment, if any, provided for in this Section 2.03(a).

b.Treatment of Restricted Stock Units. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board (or, if appropriate, a duly authorized committee thereof) shall
adopt appropriate resolutions as are necessary to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding
restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of Company Common Stock
granted under a Company Stock Plan (whether subject to time-based vesting
criteria, performance-based vesting criteria or any combination thereof)
("Restricted Stock Units") shall be fully vested (in the case of any
Restricted Stock Units subject to performance-based vesting criteria, in
accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreements) and canceled
and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such canceled Restricted Stock
Units shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancelation of
such Restricted Stock Units and in full settlement therefor, a payment in cash
of an amount equal to the sum of (i) the product of (A) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such canceled Restricted Stock Units
and (B) the Merger Consideration, plus (ii) any accrued but unpaid dividends
payable to the holder of such Restricted Stock Units, including all accrued
but unpaid interest thereon (such amounts payable hereunder, the "RSU
Payments"). From and after the Effective Time, each Restricted Stock Unit
award shall entitle the holder thereof only to the payment provided for in
this Section 2.03(b).

c.Termination of Company Stock Plans. As of the Effective Time, all Company
Stock Plans shall terminate, and no further Company Options, Restricted Stock
Units or other rights with respect to shares of Company Common Stock shall be
granted thereunder. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, a duly authorized committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions as are necessary to give effect to this Section 2.03(c).

d.Parent Funding; Payment. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Company cash in the amount necessary
to make the Option Payments, if any, required under Section 2.03(a) (Treatment
of Company Options) and the RSU Payments, if any, required under Section
2.03(b) (Treatment of Restricted Stock Units). Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to make any such payments (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholding) as promptly as practicable after the Closing Date,
but in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date of the
Surviving Corporation that is at least eight (8) Business Days following the
Closing Date, through the payroll system or payroll provider of the Surviving
Corporation. If an Option Payment or RSU Payment cannot be made to a holder of
Company Options or Restricted Stock Units through the Surviving Corporation's
payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation will issue
a check for such payment to such holder (less applicable withholding Taxes),
which check will be sent via regular first class mail to such holder as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date.

duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized and has all necessary power and
authority to own, lease and operate its assets, properties and rights and to carry on its business as currently conducted, except, in the
case of the Company Subsidiaries, where the failure of a Company Subsidiary to
be in good standing or have such power or authority, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Schedule 3.01(a) lists each
Significant Company Subsidiary and its jurisdiction of organization. The
Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified, licensed and in good
standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the conduct or nature of
its business or the ownership, leasing or holding of its properties make such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed
or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole. For purposes of this Agreement, "Significant Company Subsidiary"

b.The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of the

By-laws"), and the comparable charter and organizational documents of each

by-laws or other applicable organizational documents in any material respect.

SECTION 3.02Capital Stock of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

a.The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 15,000,000 shares of Class B Preferred Stock, par

for issuance or outstanding, in each case as of the date hereof. Except as set

Significant Company Subsidiary have been, and all such shares that may be
issued before the Effective Time will be, when issued, duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and issued in compliance with all
applicable securities Laws and not subject to, or issued in violation of, any
purchase option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right,
subscription right or any similar right under any provision of Law (including

incorporation or by-laws (or comparable documents) of any Significant Company Subsidiary or any contract, lease, license, indenture, agreement,
commitment or other legally binding arrangement ("Contract") to which the
Company or any Significant Company Subsidiary is a party or otherwise bound.

any Significant Company Subsidiary having the right to vote (or convertible
into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters
on which holders of common stock of the Company or any Significant Company
Subsidiary may vote ("Voting Company Debt").

b.Except as set forth in Section 3.02(a), as of the date hereof, there are no

membership interests, partnership interests, joint venture interests and other
Equity Interests for which an amount in excess of $5,000,000 was invested by
the Company or any Significant Company Subsidiary in any Person (other than a
Company Subsidiary) owned as of the date hereof, directly or indirectly, by
the Company or any Significant Company Subsidiary.

SECTION 3.03Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability; State Takeover

Agreement, to perform and comply with each of its obligations under this
Agreement and, subject to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, to
consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery by the Company hereof,
the performance and compliance by the Company with each of its obligations
herein and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company,
subject, in the case of the Merger, to receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval. The Company has duly executed and delivered this Agreement, and this
Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable

determined that the terms of the Merger and the other Transactions are fair
to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (iii)
recommended that the Company's stockholders adopt this Agreement and (iv)
declared that this Agreement is advisable. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations set forth in Section 4.10 (Ownership of Company Common Stock),
such resolutions are sufficient to render the provisions of Section 203 of the
DGCL inapplicable to Parent and Merger Sub and to this Agreement, the Merger
and the other Transactions. No other "business combination", "control share acquisition", "fair price", "moratorium" or other anti-takeover Laws
apply to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Merger or any other
Transaction.

necessary to approve or adopt this Agreement and the Merger is the adoption of
this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (the "Company Stockholder Approval").

any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancelation or acceleration of
any obligation, to a right to challenge the Transactions or to loss of a
material benefit under, or result in the triggering of any payments pursuant
to, or the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary under, any provision of (i) the Company
Charter, the Company By-laws or the comparable charter or organizational
documents of any Company Subsidiary, (ii) any indenture, credit agreement,
mortgage, note, instrument of indebtedness, Company Contract or Company
Benefit Plan to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by
which any of their respective properties or assets is bound or (iii) subject
to the filings and other matters referred to in Section 3.04(b), any Judgment
or Law applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or their respective
properties or assets other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above,
any such items that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had, or would
not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

b.No consent, approval, waiver, license, permit, franchise, authorization or
Judgment ("Consent") of, or registration, declaration, notice, report,
submission or other filing ("Filing") with, any government or any arbitrator,
tribunal or court of competent jurisdiction, administrative agency or
commission or other governmental authority or instrumentality (in each case
whether Federal, state, local, foreign, international or multinational) (a
"Governmental Entity") is required to be obtained or made by or with respect
to the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance hereof or the consummation of the Transactions, other

be required in connection with the Taxes described in Section 6.08 (Transfer
Taxes), (vi) such Filings and Consents as may be required solely by reason of
Parent's (as opposed to any other third party's) participation in the
Transactions and (vii) such other Consents or Filings under applicable Law the
absence of which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

a party to, or has any obligation or other commitment to become a party to,
any "off balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation
S-K).

c.The Company and the Company Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent, fixed or

concluded litigation have been fully paid.

Return or paid a particular type of Tax has asserted that the Company or such
Company Subsidiary is required to file such Tax Return or pay such type of Tax
in such jurisdiction.

e.None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary will be required to include
any material item of income in, or exclude any material item of deduction

law), (ii) installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior
to the Closing Date, (iii) prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing

payment to a Person (other than the Company or any Company Subsidiary) with
respect to Taxes or (ii) has any liability for the Taxes of any Person
(whether under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision
of state, local or foreign Law, as a transferee or successor, pursuant to any
Tax sharing or indemnity agreement or other contractual agreements, or
otherwise).

h.None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has participated or engaged in
any transaction that constitutes a "listed transaction" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations section 1.6011-4(c) (or any analogous, comparable or
similar provision of state, local or foreign Law).

corporation" or a "controlled corporation" within the meaning of Section 355

related transactions" in conjunction with the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement.

contingent) thereunder. Except as has not had, or would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect, none of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, any officer of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of the Company Benefit Plans that are
subject to ERISA, including the Company Pension Plans, any trusts created

by the Company or any Company ERISA Affiliate or to which the Company or any
Company ERISA Affiliate contributes or is required to contribute, or in which
the Company or a Company ERISA Affiliate otherwise participates or in any way
has or may have any material direct or indirect liability (including any such
plan which the Company or any Company ERISA Affiliate contributed to,

connection with the Merger and the other Transactions based upon arrangements

opinions of Centerview Partners LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, to the
effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the

qualifications and limitations set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to
be paid to the holders of Company Common Stock (other than Appraisal Shares
and shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub
or held by any affiliate of the Company or Parent) pursuant to this Agreement

reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. For purposes
of this Agreement, "Significant Parent Subsidiary" means any Parent Subsidiary that constitutes a significant subsidiary within the meaning of

b.Parent has made available to the Company copies of the organizational
documents of Parent, as amended to the date of this Agreement (as so amended,

and compliance by Parent with each of its obligations herein and the
consummation by it of the Transactions have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub. Parent, as
sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has adopted this Agreement. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has duly executed and delivered this Agreement, and this Agreement

of them, is not necessary to approve this Agreement or consummate any
Transaction.

SECTION 4.03No Conflicts; Consents.

a.The execution and delivery hereof by each of Parent and Merger Sub do not,
and the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions and compliance
with the terms hereof will not, contravene, conflict with, or result in any
violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancelation or acceleration of
any obligation, to a right to challenge the Transactions or to loss of a
material benefit under, or result in the triggering of any payments pursuant
to, or the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary under, any provision of (i) Parent Charter, Parent
By-laws or the comparable charter or organizational documents of any Parent
Subsidiary, (ii) any indenture, credit agreement, mortgage, note, instrument
of indebtedness or Benefit Plan to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a
party or by which any of their respective properties or assets is bound or
(iii) subject to the filings and other matters referred to in Section 4.03(b),
any Judgment or Law applicable to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or their
respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii) above, any such items that, individually or in the aggregate, have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

b.No Consent of, or Filing with, any Governmental Entity is required to be
obtained or made by or with respect to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance hereof or the
consummation of the Transactions or the ownership by Parent of the Surviving
Corporation following the Closing, other than (i) the Required Antitrust

Adverse Effect.

SECTION 4.04Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Proxy Statement (including any amendments or supplements thereto) will,
at the date it is first published, mailed or given to the Company's
stockholders, on the date of any amendment or supplement thereto or at the
time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

SECTION 4.05Proceedings. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no
Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary, nor is there any Judgment outstanding against Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary, that (a) seeks or imposes any material injunctive
relief, (b) relates to the Transactions or (c) would reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 4.06Compliance with Laws. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are in
compliance in all material respects with all Laws and Judgments applicable to
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, except for failures to comply that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof,
neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has received any written
communication during the past two (2) years from a Governmental Entity that
alleges that Parent or a Parent Subsidiary is not in compliance in any
material respect with any Law.

SECTION 4.07Capitalization and Operation of Merger Sub. The authorized share
capital of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares, par value $0.01 per share, of
which 100 shares are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of Merger Sub are, and at the Effective Time will be, owned
by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned Parent Subsidiary. Merger Sub
was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions, and it has
not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has no assets,
liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its
formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Transactions.

SECTION 4.08Financing.

a.Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent has
delivered to the Company (i) an equity commitment letter from Clayton,
Dubilier and Rice Fund X, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership
(the "Fund"), dated as of the date hereof, addressed to Parent (the "Equity
Commitment Letter", and the financing contemplated thereby, the "Equity
Financing") and (ii) a debt commitment letter from the lenders party thereto
(the "Committed Lenders") and the arrangers party thereto, dated as of the
date hereof, addressed to Merger Sub (including all annexes, exhibits,
schedules and other attachments thereto, and as replaced, amended,
supplemented, modified or waived after the date hereof in compliance with
Section 6.09, the "Debt Commitment Letter" and the financing contemplated
thereby, the "Debt Financing", and the Debt Financing, together with Equity
Financing, the "Financing"), pursuant to which the Committed Lenders have
committed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to
lend the amounts set forth therein for the purpose of funding the
Transactions. As of the date hereof, each of the Commitment Letters has been
accepted by Merger Sub, is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn
or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect; provided that
the existence or exercise of "market flex" provisions contained in the Fee
Letter (as defined below) shall not constitute an amendment or modification to
the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, (x) the Equity Commitment
Letter, in the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, and is
enforceable against each party thereto in accordance with its terms, and (y) the Debt Commitment Letter, in
the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Merger Sub
and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, and is enforceable
against each party thereto in accordance with its terms, in each case except
as limited by Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or
by general equitable principles. As of the date hereof, there are no other
legally binding agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the
Financing (other than the Commitment Letters and the fee letter relating to
the Debt Commitment Letter, a true and complete copy of which has been
provided to the Company, with only the existence and/or amount of fees,
"market flex" terms, pricing terms, pricing caps and other commercially
sensitive information specified therein redacted, none of which redacted
terms, individually or in the aggregate, would reduce the amount of the Debt
Financing below an amount necessary (together with the Equity Financing) to
make all payments required by this Agreement or adversely affect the
conditionality, availability or termination of the Debt Financing or
materially delay or prevent the Closing or make the funding of the Debt
Financing less likely to occur ("Permissible Redacted Terms") (such fee
letter, the "Fee Letter")) among the parties thereto. As of the date hereof,
and (in the case of clause (ii)) assuming the accuracy of the representations
set forth in Article III, no event has occurred, and there is no condition or
circumstance existing, which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would or would reasonably be likely to (i) constitute a default or breach on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub or, to Parent's knowledge, any other party
thereto, under any of the Commitment Letters or (ii) result in any portion of
the Financing being unavailable on the Closing Date. As of the date hereof,
there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the full amount of the Financing (including any "market flex"
provisions), other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters and
the Fee Letter. Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid, or caused to be fully
paid, any and all commitment fees or other amounts that are due and payable by
Parent or Merger Sub on or prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the
Commitment Letters or otherwise in connection with the Financing. As of the
date hereof, no party to any Commitment Letter has any right to impose, and
Parent and Merger Sub do not have an obligation to accept, (i) any condition
precedent to the funding of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in
or contemplated by the Commitment Letters and the Fee Letter or (ii) any
reduction to the aggregate amount available under the Commitment Letters at
Closing (nor any term or condition that would have the effect of reducing the
aggregate amount available under the Commitment Letters at Closing) to an
amount that would be insufficient for the Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the Transactions, including payment of the Required Amount. As of the date
hereof, and assuming the accuracy of the representations set forth in Article
III, each of Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, has no reason to believe
that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the
timing of the Marketing Period) any of the terms or conditions to funding to
be satisfied by it contained in the Commitment Letters.

b.Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of a Limited
Guarantee, dated as of the date hereof (the "Limited Guarantee"), by and
between the Fund and the Company, pursuant to which the Fund has guaranteed
certain payment obligations of Parent under this Agreement on the terms, and
subject to the conditions, set forth in the Limited Guarantee. The Limited
Guarantee is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Fund, except as limited by Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles.

c.Assuming the Financing is funded in full on the Closing Date in accordance
with the Commitment Letters, the accuracy of the representations set forth in
Article III and the performance by the Company and its Affiliates of their
respective obligations under this Agreement, including the obligations set
forth in Sections 6.09, 6.11 and 6.12, Parent and Merger Sub will have, at the
Closing, sufficient funds to satisfy all of the obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub hereunder and to consummate the Transactions, including payment of
the aggregate Merger Consideration, the Option Payments, RSU Payments and all related fees and expenses under this Agreement, the Commitment Letters and the
Fee Letter, in each case, that are due and payable on the Closing Date
(collectively, the "Required Amount").

d.In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including the Debt Financing) by Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other
financing or other transactions be a condition to any of Parent's or Merger
Sub's obligations under this Agreement.

SECTION 4.09Brokers; Schedule of Fees and Expenses. No broker, investment
banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any broker's,
finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in connection
with the Merger and the other Transactions based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of Parent.

SECTION 4.10Ownership of Company Common Stock. None of Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their "affiliates" or "associates" is, or at any time during the last
three (3) years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company, in each
case as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub
beneficially owns (within the meaning of Section 13 of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) as of the date hereof, or
will at any time prior to the Closing Date beneficially own, any shares of
Company Common Stock or other securities convertible into, exchangeable for or
exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock or any securities of any
Company Subsidiary, or are a party as of the date hereof, or will at any time
prior to the Closing Date become a party, to any Contract, arrangement or
understanding (other than this Agreement) for the purpose of acquiring,
holding, voting or disposing of any shares of Company Common Stock or other
securities convertible into, exchangeable for or exercisable for shares of
Company Common Stock or any securities of any Company Subsidiary.

SECTION 4.11Portfolio. Parent has provided the Company a list of entities in
which the Fund or any of its respective Affiliates has an interest greater
than five percent (5%).

SECTION 4.12Solvency

. At and immediately following the Effective Time, assuming (i) that the
representations and warranties set forth in Article III are true and correct
in all material respects, (ii) that the most recent financial forecasts for
the Company made available to Parent prior to the date hereof have been
prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were and continue to be
reasonable, (iii) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parent's and
Merger Sub's respective obligation to consummate the Transactions and (iv)
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, without giving effect to the
Financing, none of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries are
insolvent, then, after giving effect to all the Transactions (including any
debt or equity financings being entered into in connection therewith), none of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary of the Surviving
Corporation will be insolvent. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at and immediately following the Effective Time and after giving
effect to all the Transactions (including any debt or equity financings being
entered into in connection therewith), with respect to each of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and each subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation: (i)
the sum of such entity's debts will not be greater than all of such entity's
assets or property at a fair valuation; (ii) the present fair saleable value
of such entity's assets will not be less than the amount that will be required
to pay such entity's probable liability on its existing debts as they become
absolute or matured; (iii) such entity shall not have incurred, will not
intend to incur, or believe or reasonably should believe that it would incur,
debts beyond its ability to pay as they become due or as they mature; and (iv)
such entity will not be engaged and will not be about to engage in a business
or transaction for which the remaining assets or property of such entity are
unreasonably small in relation to such business or transaction, and such
entity will not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation
of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged. Parent and
Merger Sub are not entering into this Agreement or the Transactions with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either current or future creditors of the
Company or of any of its Subsidiaries. Any term or phrase used but not defined
in this Section 4.12, including "insolvent", "fair valuation", "fair saleable
value", "liabilities" and "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital
for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged" shall have the meaning generally determined with respect to such term or phrase in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the
insolvency of debtors, including the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, as
approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in
1984 and any version thereof adopted by any state whose Laws apply to the
Surviving Corporation on or after the Closing, the Uniform Fraudulent
Conveyance Act, as approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on
Uniform State Laws in 1918 and any version thereof adopted by any state whose
Laws apply to the Surviving Corporation on or after the Closing and the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code, Title 11 of the U.S.C.



SECTION 4.13No Additional Representations. PARENT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND ITS
REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN PERMITTED FULL AND COMPLETE ACCESS TO THE BOOKS AND

RELATING TO THE COMPANY AND THE COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES MADE AVAILABLE TO PARENT.

Subsidiaries and the Company's Representatives shall be permitted to, directly
or indirectly:

i.solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate any inquiries or the making of

information regarding the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any third
Person in connection therewith;

ii.participate in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish information
(whether orally or in writing) or access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to, or otherwise
cooperate with, assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage efforts by,
Persons (or Representatives of Persons) that have made, are seeking to make,
have informed the Company of an intention to make, or have publicly announced
an intention to make, any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal; and

iii.amend, grant a waiver of or terminate any "standstill" or similar
obligation of any Person with respect to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary;

provided, however, that the Company (x) shall not disclose any material non-

first entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the intended
recipient (but for the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be required
to enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with any Representatives
of such intended recipient) and (y) shall make available to Parent copies of
all material non-public information (to the extent that such non-public
information has not been previously made available to Parent) that is made
available to any such other Person (or its Representatives) before or
substantially concurrently with the time it is made available to such other
Person (or its Representatives); provided that competitively sensitive
information or data provided to any such Person who is or whose Affiliates are
a competitor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will only be provided
in a separate "clean data room" and subject to customary "clean team"
arrangements regarding access to such information or data. Notice of the
execution of any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (without identifying the
identity of the counterparty) shall be provided to Parent promptly, and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours of execution of same. As promptly as
reasonably practicable, and in any event within one (1) Business Day following
the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a written
notice setting forth the identity of each Excluded Party and each other Person
that, to the Knowledge of the Company, has (or is expected to have) a more
than ten percent (10%) equity interest in such Excluded Party, which notice
shall also include the information required by Section 5.02(f).

b.Prohibition on Soliciting Activities. Except as permitted by this Section
5.02, beginning on the No-Shop Period Start Date (or, with respect to an
Excluded Party, the Cut-Off Time) until the earlier of the Effective Time and
the termination of this Agreement, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries: i.(A) shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and the Company
shall instruct its Representatives to terminate, any solicitation,
encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any Person or its
Representatives (other than Parent and Merger Sub and their Representatives)
conducted prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date with respect to any Company

officers, directors and employees, and shall use its reasonable best efforts

indirectly (A) initiate, solicit or knowingly facilitate or encourage any
inquiry or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal, (B) engage in,
enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, or otherwise cooperate with, assist, participate in or
knowingly facilitate or encourage efforts by, any Person or groups of Persons
(or Representatives of Persons) that have made, are seeking to make, have
informed the Company of an intention to make, or have publicly announced an
intention to make, any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal, (C) take any action to make
the provisions of any "fair price", "moratorium", "control share acquisition",
"business combination" or similar anti-takeover Law, or any restrictive
provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in the Company Charter or
Company By-Laws, inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by a Company
Takeover Proposal (and, to the extent permitted thereunder, the Company shall
promptly take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver that may have been
heretofore granted to any Person other than Parent and Merger Sub under any
such provisions) or (D) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

The parties agree that for all purposes of this Agreement any violation of the
provisions of this Section 5.02(b) by any Representative of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section
5.02(b) by the Company. No later than one (1) Business Day after the No-Shop
Period Start Date, the Company shall, to the extent it had not previously done
so, deliver a request to each Person who executed a confidentiality or similar
agreement with the Company prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date in
connection with considering or making a Company Takeover Proposal (other than
any such Person that the Company is permitted to continue discussions or
negotiations with pursuant to Section 5.02(c)) to promptly return or destroy
any non-public information previously furnished or made available to such
Person or any of its Representatives on behalf of the Company or any of its
Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may continue to
take any of the actions described in the foregoing clause (ii) with respect to
any Excluded Party (for so long as such Person or group of Persons remains an
Excluded Party) from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date.

c.Discussions Permitted in Certain Circumstances. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, before receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, in response to a Company Takeover Proposal that did not
result from a material breach of Section 5.02(b), if the Company Board
determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and the
Company's financial advisor, (x) that it is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Company Proposal and (y) that failure to take the actions set forth
in clauses (A) and (B) below would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, then the Company and its Representatives may, in
response to such Company Takeover Proposal, (A) furnish information with
respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement and (B) participate in discussions and negotiations
(including solicitation of a revised Company Takeover Proposal) with such
Person and its Representatives regarding any Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall make available to Parent copies of all material non-public
information (to the extent that such non-public information has not been
previously made available to Parent) that is made available to any such third
party before or substantially concurrently with the time it is made available
to such third party. The Company shall not furnish any information or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person pursuant to
this Section 5.02(c) unless the Company notifies Parent in writing of its
intention to take such action, promptly after the Company Board determines to
take such action but in any event not more than twenty-four (24) hours after
such determination, which notice shall include any information required by
Section 5.02(f) (Required Notices). The parties agree that, notwithstanding
the commencement of the obligations of the Company under Section 5.02(b)
(Prohibition on Soliciting Activities) on the No-Shop Period Start Date, the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their Representatives may continue to
engage in the activities described in clause (A) or clause (B) of this Section
5.02(c) with respect to any Excluded Party on and after the No-Shop Period
Start Date for so long as the Excluded Party remains an Excluded Party,
including with respect to any amended or revised proposal submitted by such
Excluded Party on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date, and this Section
5.02(c) shall not apply with respect thereto.

d.Company Recommendation. Except as contemplated by Section 5.02(e) (Change in
Recommendation Permitted in Certain Circumstances), the Company shall cause
the Proxy Statement to include the recommendation of the Company Board to the
Company's stockholders that they give the Company Stockholder Approval (the
"Company Recommendation"). Except as contemplated by Section 5.02(e) (Change
in Recommendation Permitted in Certain Circumstances), neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (A) (i) change, qualify, withhold,
modify or withdraw, or authorize or resolve to change, qualify, withhold,
modify or withdraw, in any manner adverse to Parent, the approval or
recommendation by the Company Board of this Agreement or the Merger, (ii)
approve, adopt, endorse or recommend, resolve to or announce its intention to,
approve, adopt, endorse or recommend, a Company Takeover Proposal (excluding
any confidential, non-public recommendation to review, consider, clarify,
discuss, evaluate or negotiate any Company Takeover Proposal) or fail to
include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement when mailed, (iii)
within five (5) Business Days of Parent's written request, fail to make or
reaffirm the Company Recommendation following the date any Company Takeover
Proposal or material modification thereto is first published or sent or given
to the stockholders of the Company (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates or Representatives), provided that Parent may only
make such request twice with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal and once
with respect to any material modification thereto that is made public, (iv)
fail to recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 against any Company Takeover Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange
offer subject to Regulation 14D promulgated under the Exchange Act within ten
(10) Business Days after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer (it being
understood and agreed that a "stop, look and listen" statement pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall be deemed not to be a Company
Recommendation Change), or (v) publicly propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing (any one or more of the foregoing actions described in this clause
(A), a "Company Recommendation Change"), or (B) enter into, approve, adopt,
endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to enter into, approve, adopt,
endorse or recommend, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other Contract providing for a transaction referred
to in the definition of a "Company Takeover Proposal" (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).

e.Change in Recommendation Permitted in Certain Circumstances.

i.If, in response to a Superior Company Proposal received by the Company after
the date of this Agreement that did not result from a material breach of
Section 5.02(b), the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's outside counsel and financial advisor, that a
failure to make a Company Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then before receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval the Company Board may make a Company Recommendation Change, but only if (x) the
Company notifies Parent in writing of its intention to take such action,
promptly after the Company Board determines to take such action but in any
event not less than five (5) Business Days before taking such action, which
notice shall include the identity of the offeror and a true and complete copy
of the most current version of such Superior Company Proposal (including any
proposed agreement and any financing and other related documents), (y) for
five (5) Business Days following delivery of such notice (it being understood
that any amendment or modification to any Superior Company Proposal that is
the basis for such proposed Company Recommendation Change shall require a new
notice of Company Recommendation Change and a new five (5)-Business Day
period) the Company negotiates in good faith with Parent with respect to any
revised proposal from Parent in respect of the terms of the Transactions (to
the extent Parent desires to negotiate) and (z) upon the end of such five
(5)-Business Day period (as extended pursuant to clause (y)) the Company Board
shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of the
Transactions proposed in writing by Parent and shall have determined in good
faith after consultation with the Company's outside counsel and financial
advisor, (1) that the Superior Company Proposal would nevertheless continue to
constitute a Superior Company Proposal and (2) that the failure of the Company
Board to make such a Company Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

ii.If, in response to an Intervening Event, the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Company's legal counsel and financial
advisor, that a failure to make a Company Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then before
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may make a
Company Recommendation Change, but only if: (x) the Company notifies Parent in
writing of its intention to take such action promptly after the Company Board
determines to take such action but in any event not less than five (5)
Business Days before taking such action, which notice shall specify the
reasons therefor and include a description of the applicable Intervening
Event, (y) for five (5) Business Days following delivery of such notice, the
Company negotiates in good faith with Parent to make adjustments to the terms
of the Transactions (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) and (z)
following the end of such five (5)-Business Day period, the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith after consultation with the Company's
legal counsel and financial advisor that the failure of the Company Board to
make such a Company Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

f.Required Notices. From the No-Shop Period Start Date (or, with respect to
any Excluded Parties, the Cut-Off Time) until the earlier to occur of the
Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article VIII: (i) the Company promptly, and in any event within one (1)
Business Day of receipt, shall advise Parent or its Representatives in writing
of any Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal and the
identity of the Person or group of Persons making any such Company Takeover
Proposal or inquiry and unredacted copies of all material correspondence and
proposed transaction documents, including any financing documents, received by
the Company or any of its Representatives in connection with such Company
Takeover Proposal or inquiry, or, if communicated orally, a summary of the
material terms of such oral communication); and (ii) the Company shall keep
Parent informed on a current basis of the status of any such Company Takeover
Proposal or inquiry, including any material developments or change to the
material terms thereof. The terms and existence of any such Company Takeover
Proposal shall be subject to the confidentiality obligations imposed on Parent
pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement.

g.Disclosures under Law. Nothing in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit the
Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Company's stockholders a
position contemplated by (i) Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange
Act, (ii) Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or
(iii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that is
required by Law; provided, however, that this Section 5.02(g) shall not be deemed to permit the Company
Board to make a Company Recommendation Change other than in accordance with
Section 5.02(e).

h.Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:

"Company Takeover Proposal" means any bona fide written offer or proposal that
is not withdrawn by any Person or group of Persons concerning (i) any
acquisition or purchase by such Person or group, directly or indirectly, of
more than twenty percent (20%) of any class of outstanding voting or equity
securities of the Company, or any tender offer (including a self-tender offer)
or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person or group of
Persons beneficially owning more than twenty percent (20%) of any class of
outstanding voting or equity securities of the Company, (ii) any sale, lease,
exchange, transfer, license or other disposition to such Person or group,
directly or indirectly, of assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(including Equity Interests of any of Company Subsidiary) representing 20% or
more of the consolidated assets of the Company, (iii) any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, joint venture,
recapitalization, reorganization or other similar transaction involving the
Company and such Person or group of Persons pursuant to which the stockholders
of the Company immediately preceding such transaction hold less than eighty
percent (80%) of the Equity Interests in the surviving or resulting entity of
such transaction or (iv) any combination of the foregoing.

"Excluded Party" shall mean any Person or group of Persons from whom the
Company or any of its Representatives has received a Company Takeover Proposal
after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the No-Shop Period Start
Date that the Company Board determines in good faith (such determination to be
made prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date and after consultation with its
outside counsel and financial advisor) constitutes or is reasonably likely to
result in a Superior Company Proposal; provided that any Person shall cease to
be an Excluded Party if the Company Takeover Proposal submitted by such Person
is withdrawn or terminated or modified in any material respect such that such
Company Takeover Proposal would not reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Company Proposal (it being understood that a modification of a
Company Takeover Proposal submitted by such Person or group of Persons shall
not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a withdrawal or termination of a
Company Takeover Proposal submitted by such Person or group of Persons).

"Superior Company Proposal" means a bona fide written Company Takeover
Proposal (except that references in the definition of "Company Takeover
Proposal" to "20%" shall be replaced by "50%") received after the date of this
Agreement that did not result from a material breach by the Company of Section
5.02 (other than Section 5.02(a)), on its most recently amended or modified
terms, if amended or modified, that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with the Company's outside counsel and financial advisor)
to be more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Company
Common Stock than the Transactions and is reasonably likely to be timely
consummated in accordance with its terms (in each case, taking into account
all the terms and conditions of such proposal or offer (including the
transaction consideration, identity of the Person or group of Persons making
the Company Takeover Proposal, conditionality, timing, certainty of financing
and/or regulatory approvals and likelihood of consummation) and this Agreement
(including any such changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent
in response to such proposal or otherwise)). ARTICLE VI

d.The Company shall, as soon as practicable after the Proxy Statement is
cleared by the SEC for mailing to the Company's stockholders, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of seeking
the Company Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that the Company shall
not be required to mail the Proxy Statement prior to the No-Shop Period Start
Date or, if there are any Excluded Parties, the Cut-Off Time. Subject to
Section 5.02, (i) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit
proxies and secure the Company Stockholder Approval, and (ii) except as Parent
shall have otherwise consented to in writing in advance, the adoption of this
Agreement shall be the only matter (other than procedural matters and matters
that are required by the Exchange Act or other applicable Law to be voted on
by the Company's stockholders in connection therewith) which the Company shall
propose to be acted on by the Company's stockholders at the Company
Stockholders Meeting. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 6.01(d) shall not be affected by (x) the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Company
Takeover Proposal or (y) the withdrawal by the Company Board of its approval
or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger. The Company Stockholders
Meeting and the record date therefor shall be set in consultation with Parent
and shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent. The Company shall keep Parent
updated with respect to proxy solicitation efforts and tallies as reasonably
requested by Parent or Merger Sub.

e.Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
may not recess or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting, and may not
change the record date thereof, except (x) upon Parent's prior written request
or (y) with respect to any recess or postponement, (i) to the extent
necessary, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (following
consultation with the Company's advisors, including legal counsel, and with
Parent), (A) to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement is provided to the stockholders of the Company a reasonable amount
of time in advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting or (B) if as of the
time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as
set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting or to
the extent that at such time the Company has not received proxies sufficient
to allow the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company
Stockholders Meeting or (ii) to the extent required by applicable Law.

SECTION 6.02Access to Information; Confidentiality. The Company shall, and
shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, afford to Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours during the
period before the Effective Time to all their respective properties,
facilities, books, records, contracts, commitments, correspondence (in each
case, whether in physical or electronic form), officers, employees, agents and
other assets and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each
Company Subsidiary to, furnish promptly to the other party all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably
request; provided, however, that such access does not unreasonably disrupt the
normal operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. This Section
6.02 shall not require the Company or any Company Subsidiary to permit any
access, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of
such party could reasonably be expected to result in (i) the disclosure of any
trade secrets of third parties or a violation of any of its obligations with
respect to confidentiality, (ii) the loss of attorney-client privilege with
respect to such information (provided that such privilege cannot in the
Company's good-faith judgment be reasonably sufficiently protected using a
joint defense or other similar agreement) or (iii) a Governmental Entity
alleging that providing such information violates antitrust Law; provided that
the Company shall use good faith efforts to communicate to Parent the
requested information in a way that would not waive any applicable attorney-
client privilege or contravene any applicable Law or confidentiality
agreement, as applicable. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section
6.02 or pursuant to Section 6.09 shall be subject to the nondisclosure
agreement, dated as of August 5, 2019, by and between the Company and Clayton,
Dubilier and Rice, LLC (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 6.02, neither Parent nor any of its
Representatives shall conduct, without the prior written consent of the
Company, which consent may be withheld in the Company's sole discretion, any
environmental investigation at any Company Property involving any sampling or
other intrusive investigation of air, surface water, groundwater, soil, structures
or anything else at or in connection with any Company Property. During any
visit to the business or property sites of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, Parent shall, and shall cause its Representatives accessing such
properties to, comply with all applicable Laws and all of the Company's and
the Company Subsidiaries' safety and security procedures.

SECTION 6.03Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification.

a.Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions, including (i) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities, if
any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an
approval or waiver from, or to avoid a Proceeding by, any Governmental Entity,
(ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties, (iii) the defending of any Proceedings challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out
the purposes of this Agreement; provided that this Section 6.03 shall not be
deemed to (x) expand the obligation of any party with respect to any matter
that is otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement, or (y) require any
party to waive any right or condition to any of such party's obligations
hereunder. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company
and the Company Board (i) shall take all action necessary to ensure that no
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement and (ii) shall, if any state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to any
Transaction or this Agreement, take all actions necessary to ensure that the
Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise act to
render such state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation
inapplicable to the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and
its Representatives shall not be prohibited under this Section 6.03 from
taking any action permitted by Section 5.02 (Solicitation; Change of Company
Recommendation).

b.The Company and Parent shall make or file, or cause to made or filed, as
promptly as practicable, with the appropriate Governmental Entity all filings,
forms, registrations and notifications required to be filed to consummate the
Merger under any applicable Antitrust Law, and subsequent to such filings, the
Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, as
promptly as practicable, respond to inquiries from Governmental Entities, or
provide any supplemental information that may be requested by Governmental
Entities, in connection with filings made with such Governmental Entities. The
Company and Parent shall file, or cause to be filed, the notification and
report forms required under the HSR Act no later than ten (10) Business Days
after the date of this Agreement, and any filings, notifications or
submissions (or drafts thereof, as appropriate) required under any other
applicable Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable, but no later than thirty
(30) Business Days, after the date of this Agreement. Each of Parent and the
Company shall (i) cooperate with each other in connection with any such filing
and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any
Governmental Entity under applicable Laws with respect to any such filing,
(ii) keep each other apprised of the status of any communications with and any
inquiries or requests for additional information from any Governmental Entity,
(iii) comply as promptly as practicable with any such inquiry or requests for
additional information, (iv) give the other party reasonable prior notice of
any such filings or submissions and, to the extent reasonably practicable, of
any communication to or from any Governmental Entity regarding the
Transactions, and provide the other party a reasonable opportunity to review, comment on and discuss in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of the other party in connection with, any such filings,
submissions and communications, and (v) unless prohibited by applicable Law,
(A) not participate in or attend any meeting, or engage in any substantive
conversation, with any Governmental Entity in respect of the Transactions
without the other party (other than telephone calls regarding routine
administrative matters), (B) give the other party reasonable prior notice of
any such meeting or substantive conversation, and (C) furnish the other party
with copies of all filings, submissions and substantive communications to or
from any Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions; provided that
confidential information pertaining to each party may be withheld or redacted
as appropriate (except that such confidential information shall not be
withheld or redacted from copies of any filings, submissions, communications
or other documents made available by a party to the other parties' outside
counsel); provided, further, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, materials
made available to the other parties' outside counsel may be redacted to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company and the Merger.

c.Without limiting the generality of paragraph (a), Parent shall, and shall
cause the Parent Subsidiaries to, take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the Transactions, including taking all such
further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the
United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities,
competition authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction or any other
Governmental Entity or Person may assert under any Law with respect to the
Transactions, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity or Person with respect to
the Transactions so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably
possible (and in any event no later than the Outside Date), including (x)
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any
assets or businesses of Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) or their Affiliates and (y) otherwise taking or
committing to take any actions that after the Effective Time would limit the
freedom of Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) or their Affiliates with respect to, or their ability to retain,
one or more of their businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as may
be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of,
any Judgment in any Proceeding that would otherwise have the effect of
preventing the Closing, materially delaying the Closing or delaying the
Closing beyond the Outside Date; provided, however, that neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary shall become subject to, or be required to consent
or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement,
condition, understanding, agreement or order, unless such requirement,
condition, understanding, agreement or order is binding only in the event that
the Closing occurs. Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement, Parent
shall not (and shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to) take
or agree to take any action that would be reasonably likely to prevent or
materially delay the Closing. Parent shall cause its Affiliates to comply with
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.03 as if such Affiliates were
Parent, and any failure by any of its Affiliates to comply with such
obligations shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to be a breach
of this Agreement by Parent.

d.The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent or Merger Sub
shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any representation or warranty
made by it contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality
becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such representation or
warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect or (ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notice
(or failure to give any such notice) shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

SECTION 6.04Employee Benefits.

a.From the Effective Time until the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the
"Benefit Protection Period"), Parent shall provide or cause the Parent
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to provide to each individual who is an employee of the
Company or a Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time (each,
a "Company Employee") (i) base salary and wages at a rate that is no less
favorable than the rate of base salary or wages provided to such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) short-term incentive
opportunity to each Company Employee that is not less favorable than the
short-term incentive opportunity provided to such Company Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (iii) long-term incentive compensation
opportunities to each Company Employee that are comparable in value to the
long-term incentive compensation opportunities provided to such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, which may be provided in the
form of equity-based awards, cash-based awards or a combination thereof, as
determined by Parent in its sole discretion; (iv) severance benefits to each
Company Employee that are no less favorable than the severance benefits
provided under the severance plan, policy or agreement in effect for the
benefit of such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(v) other compensation and employee benefits (including paid-time off) to each
Company Employee that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the
other compensation and employee benefits provided to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

b.Without limiting the generality of Section 6.04(a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation, to, assume, honor and continue all of the
Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' employment, severance, retention and
termination Contracts (including any change-in-control or severance Contract
between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any Company Employee), in
each case, in accordance with their respective terms as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits
or rights arising as a result of the Transactions (either alone or in
combination with any other event) and, for the duration of the Benefit
Protection Period, or such longer period of time as required under the terms
of the applicable Contract, shall do so without any amendment or modification,
other than any amendment or modification required to comply with applicable
Law or as adopted in accordance with the terms of such Contract, including the
receipt of any required consents. Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to, assume, honor and
continue each short-term cash incentive or short-term bonus program covering a
Company Employee as of the Effective Time for the applicable performance
period that includes the Closing Date, and pay the Company Employees such cash
incentives or bonuses for the applicable performance measurement period that
includes the Closing Date in accordance with such programs.

c.For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits,
vesting and benefit accruals under any "employee benefit plan" (as such term
is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, but without regard to whether the
applicable plan is subject to ERISA) and any other employee benefit plan,
program, policy or arrangement maintained by Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, including any vacation,
paid time off and severance plans, each Company Employee's service with or
otherwise credited by the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the
Effective Time shall be treated as service with Parent and its Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation to the same extent such Company Employee
was entitled, prior to the Effective Time, to credit for such service under a
similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that such service
need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits or compensation.

d.Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation, to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, in which Company Employees
(and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after
the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause the
Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to recognize, or
cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and
similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying such plan year's deductible and co-payment limitations
under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Company Employee (and
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

e.Parent shall, and shall cause its relevant Affiliates to, on a timely basis,
provide the Company or a Company Subsidiary with such information as the
Company or a Company Subsidiary may reasonably request as is necessary to
comply with applicable Law (whether statutory or pursuant to any written
agreement with, or the constitution of, any works council or other employee
body) requiring it or them to consult with employees of the Company or a
Company Subsidiary, a relevant trade union, a relevant works council or any
other employee representatives in relation to the Transactions, and the
Company shall comply with all such Laws and obligations and use its reasonable
best efforts to complete such consultations as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date hereof. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed about
all material steps in the notification and/or consultation processes in the
jurisdictions concerned and shall provide Parent with any written
communications to be delivered in connection therewith reasonably advance and
consider in good faith any comments Parent has in respect of such
communications. Reasonably in advance of any meeting between the Company, a
Company Subsidiary or its representatives and a trade union, a works council
or any other employee representative, the Company shall invite a
representative of Parent to attend such meeting. All notifications and
consultations pursuant to this Section 6.04(e) shall be made in accordance
with the requirements of applicable Laws. In connection with these
consultations and notifications, the Company shall not, and shall cause the
applicable Company Subsidiaries not to, make or accept any commitments,
obligations or undertakings which could materially affect or prejudice the
financial, legal or other position of Parent without the prior written consent
of Parent.

f.Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated
as the establishment of, an amendment of, or undertaking to establish or
amend, any Company Benefit Plan or any other compensation benefit plan,
program, policy, agreement or arrangement, (ii) give any employee or former
employee or any other individual associated therewith or any employee benefit
plan or trustee thereof or any other third Person any right to enforce the
provisions of this Section 6.04, (iii) obligate Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates to maintain any particular benefit plan
program, policy, agreement or arrangement or (iv) prohibit Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates from terminating or modifying
the employment or engagement of any particular Company Employee or other
individual service provider.

g.The Company will provide to Parent by no later than the date that is twenty
(20) days following the date hereof an analysis demonstrating a reasonable
estimate of the amounts, if any, that could be received (whether in cash,
property or the vesting of property) by a "disqualified individual" from the
Company or any of its Affiliates (other than such amounts resulting from acts,
omissions or the direction of the Parent or any of its Affiliates) that could
reasonably be expected to be characterized as an "excess parachute payment"
(as such terms are defined for purposes of Section 280G of the Code). The
Company will provide an updated version of such analysis not later than ten
(10) days prior to the anticipated Closing Date.

SECTION 6.05Indemnification.

a.After the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor all the Company's obligations to exculpate or indemnify,
defend and hold harmless (including advancing funds for expenses), to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, the current and former directors and officers
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and any employee of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries who acts as a fiduciary under any Company
Benefit Plan for acts or omissions by such persons occurring at or before the
Effective Time (including acts or omissions relating to this Agreement and the
Transactions), and such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with the
terms of the Company Charter, the Company By-laws and any individual indemnity
agreements or other applicable documents from the Effective Time until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any claims
against such persons arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect of,
such acts or omissions. After the Effective Time through the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of (i) the Surviving
Corporation's certificate of incorporation as in effect immediately after the
Effective Time (the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A), (ii) the
Company By-laws and any Company Subsidiary's certificates of incorporation and
by-laws or similar organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (iii) any indemnification agreements of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or
employees as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and in each
case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) shall not amend, repeal or otherwise
modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or
former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries.

b.For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and officers'
liability insurance maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(the "DandO Insurance") (provided, however, that Parent may substitute therefor
policies with reputable and financially sound carriers of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous) with respect to claims arising from, relating to or otherwise in
respect of facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time;
provided, however, that Parent shall not be obligated to make annual premium
payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed $2,200,000
(such amount, the "Maximum Premium"). If such insurance coverage cannot be
obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the
Maximum Premium, Parent shall maintain the most advantageous policies of
directors' and officers' insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to
the Maximum Premium. At the Company's option, the Company may, in lieu of
maintaining the DandO Insurance, purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six
(6)-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially
equivalent benefits as the DandO Insurance with respect to facts or events that
occurred at or before the Effective Time, including the Transactions. If such
"tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect
for its full term and cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all obligations
thereunder.

c.If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties
and assets, then, and in each case, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
ensure that such surviving corporation or entity or the transferees of such
properties or assets assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.05.

SECTION 6.06Fees and Expenses.

a.Except as provided herein, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the Merger and the other Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring
such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated, except that
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with filing, printing and mailing
the Proxy Statement and all fees and expenses incurred in connection with
obtaining any of the Required Antitrust Filings or obtaining any other
consents or approvals from third parties necessary for Closing shall be borne
50% by Parent and 50% by the Company.

b.The Company shall pay to Parent a nonrefundable fee of $90,000,000 (the
"Company Termination Fee") if: (i) the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01(f); (ii) (A) any Person makes a Company Takeover
Proposal (except that references in the definition of "Company Takeover
Proposal" to "20%" shall be replaced by "50%") (a "Qualifying Transaction")
and thereafter Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c) or the Company terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) at a time when Parent had the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c) and (B) within twelve
(12) months of such termination the Company consummates, or enters into a
definitive agreement to consummate and subsequently consummates, a Qualifying
Transaction; (iii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(d); (iv) the Company or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(b)(i) at a time at which Parent had the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d); or (v) (A) any Person makes a Company
Takeover Proposal for a Qualifying Transaction that was publicly disclosed
before the Company Stockholders Meeting but not publicly withdrawn by the date
of the Company Stockholders Meeting and thereafter this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii) and (B) within twelve (12) months
of such termination the Company consummates, or enters into a definitive
agreement to consummate and subsequently consummates, a Qualifying
Transaction; provided, however, that in the event the Company terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) or Parent terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(i), in each case either (A) prior to the No-Shop
Period Start Date in connection with the Company's receipt of a Superior
Company Proposal, Company Takeover Proposal or Qualifying Transaction (as
applicable) or (B) before midnight New York City time on the tenth (10th) day
after the No-Shop Period Start Date (the "Cut-Off Time") in connection with a
Superior Company Proposal from an Excluded Party, the Company Termination Fee
shall instead be an amount equal to $45,000,000. The Company Termination Fee
shall be paid by wire transfer to an account to be specified by Parent of
same-day funds on the date of termination pursuant to clause (i) above, within
two (2) Business Days after termination pursuant to clause (iii) or (iv)
above, or on the date of the consummation of such transaction in the case of
termination pursuant to clause (ii) or (v) above. In no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

c.If the Company or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(iii), the Company shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer to the account
specified in Schedule 6.06(b) of same-day funds within two (2) Business Days
after such termination, an amount equal to that required to reimburse Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates for all reasonable out-of-pocket
fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions (the "Parent Expenses"), it being understood that in no event
shall payment for the Parent Expenses under this Section 6.06(c) exceed
$25,000,000; provided that in the event that the Company Termination Fee shall
subsequently become payable pursuant to clause (iv) of this Section 6.06(c),
any amount previously paid by the Company in respect of the Parent Expenses
shall be credited against the amount of the Company Termination Fee.

d.Parent shall pay the Company a nonrefundable fee of $190,000,000 (the
"Reverse Termination Fee") in the event that this Agreement is terminated (i)
by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(e) or Section 8.01(g) or (ii) by the
Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) at a time at which the
Company had the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e)
or Section 8.01(g). Any fee due under this Section 6.06(d) shall be paid by
wire transfer to the account specified in Schedule 6.06(d) of same-day funds
within two (2) Business Days after termination as contemplated in the
foregoing sentence. In no event shall Parent be required to pay the Reverse
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

e.If the Company fails to promptly pay the Company Termination Fee or the
Parent Expenses when due pursuant to Section 6.06(b) or Section 6.06(c) or
Parent fails to promptly pay the Reverse Termination Fee when due pursuant to
Section 6.06(d), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent, on the one
hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a suit that results in a
final and non-appealable judgment against the Company for the amount due
pursuant to Section 6.06(b) or Section 6.06(c) or a final and non-appealable
judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in Section 6.06(d), the
Company shall pay to Parent, or Parent shall pay to the Company, as
applicable, its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket attorneys' fees) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount or portion
thereof at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published
in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid to the date of actual payment
(any such amount, the "Termination Expenses and Interest"). Any amount payable
pursuant to this Section 6.06(e) shall be paid by the applicable party by wire
transfer of same-day funds prior to or on the date such payment is required to
be made pursuant to such final and non-appealable judgment.

f.The parties agree that the agreements contained in this Section 6.06 are an
integral part hereof and that the Company Termination Fee, the Reverse
Termination Fee, the Parent Expenses and the Termination Expenses and Interest
constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty.

SECTION 6.07Public Announcements. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other before issuing,
and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, and shall
use reasonable best efforts to agree on, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the
prior written consent of the other party (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), except to the extent required by Law, court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange; provided that the foregoing shall not restrict
disclosures of information by or on behalf of any party hereto or its
respective Affiliates or successors, on the one hand, to their respective
direct and indirect potential investors, Affiliates, financing sources,
counsel, accountants, consultants and others, on the other hand (so long as,
in the case of any such disclosures by or on behalf of Parent or any of its
respective Affiliates or successors, such disclosure has a valid business
purpose and is effected in a manner consistent with customary private equity
practices).

SECTION 6.08Transfer Taxes. All stock transfer, real estate transfer,
documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including interest,
penalties and additions to any such Taxes) ("Transfer Taxes") arising as a
result of the Transactions shall be paid by either Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation, and the Company shall cooperate with Merger Sub and Parent in
preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer

SECTION 6.09Financing.

a.Prior to the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, advisable or desirable to arrange and consummate
the Financing on terms and conditions no less favorable to Parent and Merger
Sub than those described in or contemplated by the Commitment Letters and the
Fee Letter (including any "market flex" provisions that are contained in the
Fee Letter), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) satisfy on a
timely basis (taking into account the anticipated timing of the Marketing
Period) all conditions applicable to Parent or Merger Sub set forth in the
Commitment Letters and the Fee Letter (including definitive agreements related
thereto) that are within its control, including the payment of any commitment,
engagement or placement fees required as a condition to the Debt Financing,
(ii) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters (subject to Parent's right to
amend, modify, supplement, restate, assign, substitute or replace the
Commitment Letters in accordance herewith), comply with its obligations
pursuant to the Commitment Letters, diligently enforce their rights under the
Commitment Letters and, with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter, negotiate
and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and
conditions no less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than those described in
or contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter (including
any "market flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter), (iii) consummate
the Financing at or prior to the Closing, (iv) ensure the participation by a
Representative of Parent and Merger Sub in, and assistance by Representatives
of Parent and Merger Sub with, the preparation of rating agency presentations,
meetings with ratings agencies and meetings with prospective lenders and (v)
comply with Merger Sub's obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Fee Letter. If funds in the amounts and on the terms set forth in a Debt
Commitment Letter become unavailable to Parent or Merger Sub on the terms and
conditions (including any "market flex" provisions contained in the Fee
Letter) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter (other than as a result of the Company's
breach of this Agreement, or if the Company's failure to perform would be the
sole cause of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 or Section 7.02 not to
be satisfied), Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company of such
fact and shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as
practicable alternative debt financing (the "Alternative Financing") in
amounts, when added with the Equity Financing, sufficient to consummate the
Transactions, including, for the avoidance of doubt, payment of the Required
Amount and that would not (i) include any conditions precedent to the Debt
Financing that are not contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee
Letter that would reasonably be expected to (1) make the funding of the Debt
Financing (or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt
Financing) less likely to occur or (2) materially delay or prevent the Closing
and (ii) otherwise reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the
Closing; provided that Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to accept
any Alternative Financing having terms and conditions (including "market flex"
provisions) less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than those in the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter; provided, further, that if Parent and
Merger Sub proceed with such Alternative Financing, Parent and Merger Sub
shall be subject to the same obligations with respect to such Alternative
Financing as set forth in this Section 6.09(a) with respect to the Financing,
and all references in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing", "Financing",
"Debt Commitment Letter", "Fee Letter" and "Commitment Letters" (and other
like terms in this Agreement) shall be deemed to also include such Alternative
Financing, as applicable. In the event all conditions applicable to the
Commitment Letters have been satisfied or waived, Parent shall cause the Fund
to fund the Equity Financing and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Persons providing the Debt Financing to fund such Debt Financing
required to consummate the Transactions on the Closing Date.

b.Upon written request of the Company, Parent shall keep the Company apprised
(as promptly as possible, and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) of
material developments relating to the Financing. Parent shall give the Company
prompt written notice of any material adverse change with respect to the
Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall give
the Company prompt written notice and, in any event, within forty-eight (48)
hours, (i) of any breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to
any of the Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the
Financing of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, (ii) of the receipt of
(A) any written notice or (B) other written communication, in each case from
any Lender Related Party with respect to any (1) actual breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any of the Commitment Letters or
definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of the
Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing of which
Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware or (2) material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to the Commitment Letters or definitive
agreements of which Parent becomes aware related to the Financing with respect
to the obligation to fund any of the Financing or the amount of the Financing
to be funded at the Closing and (iii) if at any time for any reason Parent
believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion
of the Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by the Commitment Letters or definitive agreements
related to the Financing such that it would not have amounts sufficient to
consummate the Merger and the other Transactions, including payment of the
Required Amount. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within
forty-eight (48) hours of the date that the Company delivers to Parent a
written request, Parent shall provide any information reasonably requested by
the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii) or
(iii) of the immediately preceding sentence. Parent shall not replace, amend,
supplement, modify or waive the Debt Commitment Letter or any provision of any
fee letter relating to the Debt Commitment Letter (it being understood that
the existence or exercise of "market flex" provisions contained in the Fee
Letter shall not constitute a replacement, amendment, supplement, modification
or waiver of the Debt Commitment Letter), without the Company's prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, or conditioned or
delayed) if such replacement, amendment, supplement, modification or waiver
(x) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing
the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing or similar fees) such that Parent would
not have amounts sufficient to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions, including payment of the Required Amount, (y) amends the
conditions precedent to the Debt Financing in a manner that adds additional
conditions precedent to the Debt Financing, or otherwise expands, amends or
modifies any of the conditions precedent to the availability of the Debt
Financing, in each case, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (1)
make the funding of the Debt Financing (or the satisfaction of the conditions
to obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely to occur or (2) materially delay
or prevent the Closing or (z) adversely impacts the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter (as it may be replaced, amended, supplemented, modified or
waived in accordance with this Section 6.09); provided that Parent and Merger
Sub may replace, amend, supplement or modify the Debt Commitment Letter to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
(or titles with respect to such entities) that have not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement (it being understood that
the aggregate commitments of the lenders party to the Debt Commitment Letter
prior to such amendment, supplement or modification may be reduced in the
amount of such additional party's commitments) (provided that, except as
provided for in the Debt Commitment Letter with respect to Additional
Committing Lenders (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter), no such
addition shall relieve the original Committed Lenders of their obligations
under the Debt Commitment Letter prior to the funding of the Debt Financing).
Parent shall promptly provide to the Company true and complete copies of any
commitment letter and fee letter (which, in the case of a fee letter, may
redact Permissible Redacted Terms) associated with a replacement Debt
Financing or Alternative Financing as well as any amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver of any Debt Commitment Letter or any related fee letter
(which, in the case of a fee letter, may redact Permissible Redacted Terms),
that is permitted hereunder.

c.Parent shall not replace, amend, supplement, modify or waive or agree to
replace, amend, supplement, modify or waive (in any case whether by action or
inaction), any term of the Equity Commitment Letter without the prior written
consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Parent shall promptly (and in any event within one
(1) Business Day) notify the Company of (i) the expiration or termination (or
attempted or purported termination, whether or not valid) of the Equity
Commitment Letter or (ii) any refusal by the Fund to provide the full
financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter.

d.Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
provide, and to cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to use their reasonable best efforts to provide, to Parent and
Merger Sub, in each case at Parent's sole cost and expense (subject to the
expense reimbursement provision in the last sentence of this Section 6.09(d)),
such cooperation as is customary and reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing or any customary high-
yield non-convertible bonds being issued in lieu of all or any portion of the
Debt Financing, including by:

i.assisting in preparation for and participating (including causing the
Company's and Company Subsidiaries' management teams, with appropriate
seniority and expertise to participate) in a reasonable number of investor and
lender meetings (including a reasonable and limited number of customary one on
one meetings and calls that are requested in advance with or by the parties
acting as lead arrangers, bookrunners or agents for, and prospective lenders
and purchasers of, the Debt Financing), lender due diligence presentations,
drafting sessions, road shows and presentations, including sessions with
rating agencies in connection with the Debt Financing or any customary high-
yield non-convertible bonds being issued in lieu of all or any portion of the

assisting Parent in obtaining ratings in connection with the Debt Financing or
any customary high-yield non-convertible bonds being issued in lieu of all or
any portion of the Debt Financing;

ii.assisting Parent, Merger Sub and the Lender Related Parties with the

with the Debt Financing or any customary high-yield non-convertible bonds
being issued in lieu of all or any portion of the Debt Financing; provided
that (i) the Company's obligation to provide information for such materials
shall be limited to information about the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub shall be solely responsible for, the
preparation of pro forma financial information, including pro forma cost
savings, synergies, capitalization or other pro forma adjustments desired to
be incorporated into any pro forma financial information (collectively, the
"Debt Marketing Materials"), including (A) furnishing business and financial
projections with respect to the Company on a consolidated basis reasonably
requested by Parent or Merger Sub and (B) furnishing records, data or other
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries necessary
to support any statistical information or claims relating to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries appearing in the Debt Marketing Materials;

iii.executing and delivering as of (but not prior to) the Closing any pledge
and security documents, other definitive financing documents for the Debt
Financing or any customary high-yield non-convertible bonds being issued in
lieu of all or any portion of the Debt Financing, or other certificates or
documents and back up therefor and for legal opinions as may be reasonably
requested by Parent (including (x) solely to the extent such Person has been
appointed as chief financial officer or treasurer (or other comparable
officer) of the Borrower (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) on the
Closing Date, executing and delivering a certificate of the chief financial
officer or treasurer (or other comparable officer) of the Borrower
substantially in the form attached as Annex I to Exhibit E to the Debt

(y) any certificate or other document reasonably requested by Parent as backup

contemplated by Section 6.12)) and otherwise reasonably facilitating the
granting of guarantees and the pledging of collateral; provided that (A) none
of the documents or certificates shall be executed and/or delivered except in
connection with the Closing, (B) the effectiveness thereof shall be
conditioned upon, or become operative after, the occurrence of the Closing (in
the case of each of the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), other than the

in accordance with, this Section 6.09, Section 6.11 and Section 6.12) and any information used in
connection therewith, in each case other than to the extent any of the

terminated in accordance with its terms.

h.Parent acknowledges and agrees that, except as otherwise expressly provided

reasonably satisfactory to Parent, providing for the payoff, discharge and
termination in full on the Closing Date of all indebtedness and commitments
with respect thereto for the Existing Credit Facilities, and the release of

such prepayment prior to the occurrence of the Closing). SECTION 6.12Company Indentures.

reasonable consideration to the comments, if any, raised by the Company (the
"2021 Notes Tender Offer Documents") and the material terms and conditions of
the 2021 Notes Tender Offer. The terms and conditions specified by Parent for
the 2021 Notes Tender Offer shall be in compliance with the 2021 Indenture and
any applicable Laws. The closing of a 2021 Notes Tender Offer, if any, shall
be expressly conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, and in accordance

2021 Notes Tender Offer (provided that the proposed amendments to the 2021
Indenture set forth in any 2021 Notes Tender Offer Document may not become
operative unless and until the Closing has occurred). The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause Anixter Opco to provide, and to cause its
Representatives to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the 2021 Notes Tender Offer, including appointing a dealer

any other applicable Law, it being understood that Anixter Opco shall not be
required to take any action that does not comply with Rule 14e-1, the TIA, if
applicable, or other applicable Law. The Company shall cause Anixter Opco to
waive any of the conditions to a 2021 Notes Tender Offer as may be reasonably
requested by Parent (other than the condition that a 2021 Notes Tender Offer
is conditioned on the Closing occurring), so long as such waivers would not
cause a 2021 Notes Tender Offer to violate the Exchange Act, the TIA or any
other applicable Law, and to not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
waive any condition to a 2021 Notes Tender Offer or make any material change,
amendment or modification to the terms and conditions of a 2021 Notes Tender
Offer (including any extension thereof) other than as directed by Parent. If
all of the 2021 Notes then outstanding are validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn in the 2021 Notes Tender Offer, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause Anixter Opco to cause the delivery, taking or making of
all required documents, actions or payments (other than the deposit of funds,
if any, in accordance with clause (iii) below) under the 2021 Indenture to
effect the satisfaction and discharge or defeasance of the 2021 Indenture
pursuant to the requisite provisions of the 2021 Indenture; and/or

ii.if requested by Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to cause Anixter
Opco to (x) deliver, or use its reasonable best efforts to cause the trustee
under the 2021 Indenture to deliver, a notice of optional redemption on the
Closing Date (contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing) (the "2021
Redemption Notice") for all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of
the 2021 Notes, pursuant to the requisite provisions of the 2021 Indenture and
(y) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the delivery, taking or making of
all required documents, actions or payments (other than the deposit of funds
in accordance with clause (iii) below) under the 2021 Indenture to effect the satisfaction and discharge or defeasance of the 2021 Indenture pursuant to the
requisite provisions of the 2021 Indenture. The Company shall (1) provide
Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on drafts of the
definitive documentation for any such redemption of the 2021 Notes and will
give reasonable consideration to the comments, if any, raised by Parent and
(2) use its reasonable best efforts to cause Anixter Opco to timely provide
the trustee under the 2021 Indenture with such officers' certificates and
other documentation or take such actions required by the 2021 Indenture or
reasonably requested by the trustee under the 2021 Indenture in connection
therewith; and

iii.on the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable after the Merger is
consummated, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall deposit or cause to be
deposited funds with the trustee under the 2021 Indenture as required pursuant
to the terms of the 2021 Indenture and (if applicable) the 2021 Redemption
Notice sufficient to effect the satisfaction and discharge or defeasance of
the 2021 Indenture. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
deliver to Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date a
schedule setting forth the amount required to be deposited with the trustee
under the 2021 Indenture on the Closing Date sufficient to effect the
satisfaction and discharge or defeasance of the 2021 Indenture, together with
wire transfer instructions. The Company shall (1) provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on drafts of the definitive
documentation for any such satisfaction and discharge or defeasance of the
2021 Notes and 2021 Indenture at the Closing, and will give reasonable
consideration to the comments, if any, raised by Parent, and (2) use its
reasonable best efforts to cause Anixter Opco to timely provide the trustee
under the 2021 Indenture with such officers' certificates and other
documentation or take such actions required by the 2021 Indenture or
reasonably requested by the trustee under the 2021 Indenture in connection
therewith. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain a trustee's acknowledgement of satisfaction and
discharge or defeasance of the 2021 Indenture, in a form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and executed by the trustee under the 2021
Indenture;

b.Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Company shall,

their respective Representatives (including legal and accounting
representatives) to, with respect to the 2023 Notes and the 2023 Indenture:

not, without the prior written consent of Parent, waive any condition to the
2023 Notes Consent Solicitation or make any material change, amendment or
modification to the terms and conditions of any 2023 Notes Consent

party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party
to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. For any matter under
this Agreement requiring the consent or approval of any party, such consent or
approval shall be valid and binding on a party hereto only if such consent or
approval is delivered in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party.

SECTION 8.05Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver. A

policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.
