(b) _Definitions Relating to Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(1) The " **Merger Consideration** " shall be: $120,500,000.

automatically exchanged for the applicable respective portion of the Merger
Consideration, calculated pursuant to Section 1.7(b) and the Company
Certificate, subject to the setting aside of the Escrow Fund and the
provisions of Article VIII.

  



  

For clarity and illustration, making the assumptions specified in Section
1.7(b)(2)(iv), and subject in all cases (other than Company Common Stock) to
the setting aside of the Escrow Fund and the provisions of Article VIII:

holders of such class or series pursuant to Section 1.7(c)(1) shall
respectively be called the " **Cash Exchange Ratio** " for that class or
series.

  



  

(3) The aggregate amount of cash to be paid to each holder of Company Capital
Stock (a " **Shareholder** ") hereunder shall be calculated by aggregating
all shares of Company Capital Stock held by such Shareholder and multiplying,
for each share, by the respective Cash Exchange Ratio, and rounded (after
aggregation) to the nearest whole cent, so

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

that the aggregate amounts paid to Shareholders plus the Option Allocation is
equal to the Allocable Merger Consideration.

  



  

(d) _Assumption of Company Options_. As described in Section 5.10, the
Company Options that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time

Parent (the " **Parent Common Stock** ").

  



  

(e) _Exchange of Company Warrants and Other Rights Outstanding_. As of the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, each Company Warrant and each Other Right

evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

(g) _Adjustments to Cash Exchange Ratio_. The Cash Exchange Ratio (and any
amounts or numbers described by defined terms used to calculate the Cash
Exchange Ratio) applicable to any class or series of Company Common Stock
shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Capital Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or
other like change with respect to Company Capital Stock occurring after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time so as to provide Parent and the
holders of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse
split, stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization or like change.

  



  

(h) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any shares of capital stock of the Company for which the

Section 262 of the Delaware Law or (to the extent applicable) Chapter 13 of
the California Corporations Code (the " **CCC** ") (such shares, "
**Dissenting Shares** ") shall not be converted into or represent the right
to receive a portion of Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
1.7(c), and the holder or holders of such shares shall be entitled only to
such rights as may be granted to such holder or holders in Section 262 of the
Delaware Law or (to the extent applicable) Chapter 13 of the CCC; provided,
however, that if the status of any such shares as Dissenting Shares shall not
be perfected, or if any such shares shall lose their status as Dissenting
Shares, then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the time of the
failure to perfect such status or the loss of such status, such shares shall
automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right to receive
(upon the surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such
shares) a portion of the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section

extent applicable) the CCC, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice

customary form and have such other provisions as are reasonably acceptable to
the Company and Parent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Stock Certificates in exchange for the a portion of the

(or, as applicable, a certification of lost instrument and indemnity) to the

Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such
Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
amount of cash which such holder has a right to receive as Merger

defined in Article VIII) an amount equal $12,000,000 (the " **Escrow Fund

the " **Escrow Cash** "), which shall be set aside from distributions of the
portion of Merger Consideration into which shares of Company Capital Stock
(other than Company Common Sock) shall have been converted. The Escrow Cash
shall be governed by and released in accordance with Article VIII and the
Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(d) _Conversion Schedule_. The Company has provided Parent with a schedule,

records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the appropriate

thereof; provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Stock Certificates to (a) deliver a bond in such sum as
the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity, (b) certify the loss, theft or
destruction of such Stock Certificate and (c) agree to indemnify Parent for
damages suffered by Parent as a result of such loss, theft or destruction or
against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation

**Section 2.15(g)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete

the total payments to Company did not exceed Twenty Thousand Dollars
($20,000) and otherwise are not material to Company (collectively, the "
**Outbound License Agreements** "), indicating for each the title and the
parties thereto; except that such schedule need not list (i) non-disclosure
agreements that do not grant substantive use rights in Intellectual Property

under each Inbound License Agreement shall, subject to the satisfaction of
the assignment consent obligations listed on Section 2.9 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, be exercisable by Parent on and immediately after the
Closing to the same extent as by Company immediately prior to the Closing. To
Companys knowledge, no loss or expiration (other than by expiration of the
term of the relevant agreement) of any Intellectual Property licensed to
Company under any Inbound License Agreement is pending or reasonably
foreseeable or threatened. No licensor under any Inbound License Agreement
has any ownership or exclusive license rights in or with respect to any
improvements made by Company to the Intellectual Property licensed
thereunder, although no representation is made concerning licenses for
Administrative Materials. There is no outstanding or, to Companys knowledge,
threatened dispute or disagreement with respect to any Inbound License
Agreement or any Outbound License Agreement or the Intellectual Property
licensed thereunder. Company has not made any submission or suggestion to and
is not subject to any agreement with a standards body or multi-party
standards agreement that would obligate Company to grant licenses to or
otherwise impair its control of its Intellectual Property.

or other rights to use, free and clear of all Liens, orders and arbitration
awards, all of the Intellectual Property used in the design, manufacture,

versions that have been shipped to customers (including in prototype) and, to
the knowledge of Company, in versions of the Companys products contemplated
by Company, except as set forth on Section 2.15(g) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. Company owns or possesses adequate licenses or other rights to use,
free and clear of all Liens, orders and arbitration awards, all of the
Intellectual Property used by it in its business (other than the design,
manufacture, import, sale and support of the products addressed in the
foregoing sentence) as currently conducted or as currently contemplated by
Company to be conducted, except with respect to aspects of its business
currently contemplated by Company but not sufficiently developed to require
licenses to any third party materials that may eventually be necessary.
The Scheduled Company IP, Company Owned Copyrights, Company Trade Secrets
and Company Software, together with Companys rights under the licenses
granted to Company under the Inbound License Agreements (collectively, the "
** _Intellectual Property Assets_** "), constitute all the Intellectual
Property rights used in the Companys business as it is currently conducted
and are all the Intellectual Property rights necessary to operate the

Parent has timely filed and made available to the Company each required
statement, report, registration statement (with the prospectus in the form
filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "
**Securities Act** ")), definitive proxy statement, and other filings filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " **SEC** ") by Parent
since December 31, 2003, and prior to the Effective Time, Parent will have
furnished the Company with true and complete copies of any additional
documents filed with the SEC by Parent prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the " **Parent SEC Documents** ").  In addition, Parent has
made available to the Company all exhibits to the Parent SEC Documents filed
prior to the date hereof, and will promptly make available to the Company all
exhibits to any additional Parent SEC Documents filed prior to the Effective
Time. As of their respective filing dates, the Parent SEC Documents complied
(or will comply) in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act, and none of the Parent SEC Documents
contained (or will contain) any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted (or will omit) to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent
corrected by a subsequently filed Parent SEC Document.  The financial
statements of Parent, including the notes and schedules thereto, included in
the Parent SEC Documents (the " **Parent Financial Statements** ") were
complete and correct in all material respects as of their respective dates,
complied as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the rules and regulations of the SEC with respect

consistent with each other (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto
or, in the case of unaudited statements included in Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC). The Parent Financial
Statements fairly present the consolidated financial condition and operating
results of Parent at the dates and during the periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal, recurring year-end
adjustments which were not and are not expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, material in amount). Parent and each of its subsidiaries
maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with
the management of such companys general or specific authorization; (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets;
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management of
such companys general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with

respect to any differences.

34   

     
   

  



  

(d) any authorization of, or commitment or agreement to take any of, the
foregoing actions except as otherwise permitted by this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 3.10** Financing

  

 ** **

  

Parent has sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of
immediately available funds to enable it to make payment of the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts to be paid by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation hereunder in full in connection with the Closing.

  



  

 **Section 3.11** No Litigation

  

 ** **

  

No litigation or proceeding exists that would be reasonably expected to (i)
have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) preclude
consummation of the Merger, or (iii) conflict with or impair Parent or Merger
Subs ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement, including
without limitation by impairing their respective assets or properties to an

Corporation hereunder in full in connection with the Closing.

required or appropriate for inclusion in the Information Statement, or in any
amendments or supplements thereto, and to cause its counsel and auditors to
cooperate with the others counsel and auditors in the preparation of the
Information Statement. The Company will promptly advise Parent, and Parent
will promptly advise the Company, in writing if at any time prior to the

 **Section 5.4** Confidentiality

  

 ** **

  

The parties hereto acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously
executed a non-disclosure agreement dated January 26, 2005 (the "
**Confidentiality Agreement** ") which Confidentiality Agreement shall

40   

     
   

  



  

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any party to this Agreement
(and any employee, representative, or other agent of any party to this
Agreement) may disclose to any and all persons having a need to know such
information for reasons related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " **Transactions** "), the tax treatment and tax structure of
the Transactions, and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other

practicable to all inquiries or requests received from the Federal Trade
Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice for

parties shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all
such filings or responses, including notifying the other party of any
communications or discussions with any government agency and using reasonable
efforts where practicable to afford the other party the opportunity to

to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other Federal, state or
foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders or decrees that are designed

  



  

41   

     
   

  



  

to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect
of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, " **Antitrust Laws**
"). In connection therewith, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law,
each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use all commercially
reasonable efforts vigorously to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent (each an " **Order** "), that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents, or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
or any such other transactions, unless by mutual agreement Parent and the
Company decide that litigation is not in their respective best interests.
 Notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence, it is
expressly understood and agreed that neither Parent nor the Company

have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company

 ** **

  

Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly apply for or otherwise seek,
and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, all consents and approvals
required to be obtained by it for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. The Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents,
waivers and approvals under any of its Material Contracts for the assignment
thereof or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
including the provisions of Sections 5.11 and 7.3 below, if the lessor or
licensor under any of the Companys leases requests that the Parent guarantee
obligations under such lease and the Parent refuses to so guarantee such
lease, then if the lessor or licensor under any of the Companys leases
conditions its grant of a consent (including by threatening to exercise a
"recapture" or other termination right) upon, or otherwise requires in
response to a notice or consent request regarding this Agreement, the payment
of a consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other consideration (including
increased rent payments), or the provision of additional security (including

or providing all such additional security.

respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and will take all reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and will
cooperate with the other parties hereto in obtaining) any consent, approval,
order or authorization of, or any registration, declaration or filing with,
any Governmental Entity or

  



  

42   

     
   

  



  

other person, required to be obtained or made by them in connection with the
taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement.

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option shall by virtue of
the Merger be assumed by Parent. Each Company Option so assumed by Parent
under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms
and conditions of such options immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, any repurchase rights or vesting provisions),
except that (i) each Company Option will be exercisable (or will become
exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock) of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Option Exchange
Ratio, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option will be equal to
the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) determined by dividing
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company
Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option
Exchange Ratio. Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent will issue to

cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable (subject to any
applicable laws) to consummate and make effective the Merger as promptly as
practicable including, but not limited to (i) the preparation and filing of
all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the

Agreement in favor of such directors, officers, employees and agents.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain tail coverage to continue the
Companys existing director and officer liability coverage for six years
following the Closing Date; provided, however, that any expense incurred by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to obtain coverage that exceeds the
policy limits of Parents director and officer liability coverage (as of the
Closing Date) will be deemed a "Recoverable Expense" for purposes of Article
VIII.

  



  

(b) Parent agrees to pay all expenses, including attorneys fees, which may
be incurred by any director or officer of the Company in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section 5.12.

or any of its subsidiaries following the Closing Date (" **Continuing

in the employee welfare benefit plans, programs or policies (including

action necessary to terminate, or cause to terminate, before the Effective

meaning of Section 423 of the Code.

  



  

(c) After the Closing Date, Parent will grant to the Continuing Employees
options to purchase Parent Common Stock, Parent restricted stock units, or a

for a period of at least six months after the Closing Date, severance

prevailing in the Continuing Employees employment location for similarly
situated employees, but in any event shall not be less favorable than: three
months salary and continued medical insurance benefits.

  



  

45   

      
  

  



  

(e) Parent shall establish and maintain a bonus plan for the benefit of those
persons who are employees of the Company as of the Closing Date, as described

and exhibits thereto) in excess of the amount of the Escrow Fund; provided,
however, that there shall be no indemnification by the shareholders of the
Company for any matters described in Section 8.2(a) if the Merger does not
become effective. In the case of fraud or willful misconduct, Parent shall
have all remedies available at law or in equity (including for tort) with
respect to such conduct.

the Escrow Agent as provided in Section 8.4 and such amount is determined
pursuant to this Article VIII to be payable, in which case, Parent shall
receive cash equal to the full amount of Damages (and not just for the amount
of Damages in excess of the Indemnity Threshold), it being understood and
agreed that the Indemnity Threshold shall apply to each individual
claim, such that each individual claim must exceed $50,000 before Parent
receives payment from the Escrow Fund for that claim, and it being further
understood and agreed that the term " **individual claim** " includes a
group of claims made by the same party (under the same agreement,
if applicable) all arising from a single cause; and

  



  

(2) on account of Recoverable Expenses or Escrow Expenses without regard to
the Indemnity Threshold, after one or more Officers Certificates
identifying Recoverable Expenses or Escrow Expenses have been delivered to
the Escrow Agent as provided in Section 8.4 and such amount is determined
pursuant to this Article VIII to be payable, in which case, Parent shall
receive cash equal to the full amount of such Recoverable Expenses or Escrow
Expenses.

  



  

(d) If and to the extent that Parent is able to file a valid insurance claim
with respect to any claim for indemnification under this Agreement, (i)
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file such insurance claim
before pursuing its rights against the shareholders of the Company, and (ii)
the amount of Damages owing to Parent hereunder shall be reduced by

  



  

53   

     
   

  



  

the amount recovered from such insurance claim. However, subject to the
immediately preceding provision, the parties agree that this shall in no way
limit the right of Parent to fully pursue its indemnification and any
other rights against the shareholders of the Company arising pursuant to
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements.  The parties agree that any
indemnification provided by this Agreement is not to be deemed insurance
(whether primary, excess, or otherwise) for purposes of seeking reimbursement
from the applicable insurance coverage.

  



  

(e) The parties agree that there shall not be any multiple recovery for any
Damages.

  



  

 **Section 8.3** Escrow Period

  

 ** **

  

The escrow period (the " **Escrow Period** ") shall terminate at 11:59 p.m.
Pacific Time on the first anniversary of the Closing Date.

  



  

 **Section 8.4** Claims upon Escrow Fund

  

 ** **

  

(a) Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent at or before the end of the Escrow
Period of a certificate signed by any officer of Parent (an " **Officer s
Certificate**"):

  



  

(1) stating that Damages exist in an aggregate amount greater than the
Indemnity Threshold, or stating that Recoverable Expenses or Escrow Expenses
exist; and

  



  

(2) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items included in such
claim, the date each such item was paid, properly accrued or arose and the
nature of the breach of warranty or claim to which such item is related (if
applicable); then

  



  

the Escrow Agent shall set aside such cash or other assets held in the Escrow
Fund, as applicable, having a value equal to such Damages,
Recoverable Expenses, or Escrow Expenses.

  



  

(b) Upon the earliest of: (i) receipt of written authorization from the
Shareholders Agent or from the Shareholders Agent jointly with Parent to
make such delivery, (ii) receipt of written notice of a final decision in
arbitration of the claim, or (iii) in the event the claim set forth in the
Officers Certificate is uncontested by the Shareholders Agent as of the
close of business on the next business day following the forty-fifth (45th)
day following receipt by the Escrow Agent of the Officers Certificate; on
the next business day the Escrow Agent shall deliver cash or other assets
from the Escrow Fund to Parent.

  



  

 **Section 8.5** Objections to Claims

  



  

At the time of delivery of any Officers Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a
duplicate copy of such Officers Certificate shall be delivered to the
Shareholders Agent and for a period of forty-five (45) days after such
delivery to the Escrow Agent of such Officers Certificate, the Escrow Agent
shall make no delivery from the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 8.4 unless
the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from
the Shareholders Agent to make such delivery.  After the expiration of such
forty-five (45) day period, the Escrow Agent shall make delivery from the
Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 8.4, provided that no such payment or
delivery may be made if the Shareholders Agent shall object in a written
statement

  



  

54   

     
   

  



  

to the claim made in the Officers Certificate, and such statement shall have
been delivered to the Escrow Agent and to Parent prior to the expiration of
such forty-five (45) day period.

  



  

 **Section 8.6** Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration

  



  

(a) In case the Shareholders Agent shall so object in writing to any claim
or claims by Parent made in any Officers Certificate, Parent shall have
forty-five (45) days after receipt by the Escrow Agent of an objection by the
Shareholders Agent to respond in a written statement to the objection of the
Shareholders Agent. If after such forty-five (45) day period there remains a
dispute as to any claims, the Shareholders Agent and Parent shall attempt in
good faith for sixty (60) days to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Shareholders Agent and
Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and
shall distribute from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.

  



  

(b) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either
Parent or the Shareholders Agent may, by written notice to the other, demand
arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the damage or loss is at issue
in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall
not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to
arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be settled by
arbitration conducted by three arbitrators. Within twenty (20) days after such
written notice is sent, Parent and the Shareholders Agent shall each select
one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a
third arbitrator. If within such twenty (20) day period, either Parent or
the Shareholder Agent does not select one arbitrator and give written notice
to the other party of the arbitrator selected, the arbitrator that would
otherwise have been selected by such party shall be selected by the American
Arbitration Association. The decision of the arbitrators as to the validity
and amount of any claim in such Officers Certificate shall be binding and
conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement, and notwithstanding
anything in this Section 8.6, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in
accordance with such decision and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow
Fund in accordance therewith.

  



  

(c) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in Santa Clara
County, California under the commercial rules then in effect of the American
Arbitration Association.  Parent, on the one hand, and the Company
shareholders, on the other hand, shall each bear its/their own expenses
(including, attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with any
such arbitration. The Company shareholders expenses and reasonable
attorneys fees will be paid by the Shareholders Agent from the Escrow Fund,
as provided in Section 8.7(c).  In the event the arbitrator or arbitrators
find in favor of Parent as to the claim in dispute, all fees, costs, and the
reasonable expenses of legal counsel incurred by Parent will be charged
against the Escrow Fund in addition to the amount of the disputed claim.
In the event the arbitrator or arbitrators find in favor of the
Company stockholders as to the claim in dispute, all fees, costs, and the
reasonable expenses of legal counsel incurred by the Company stockholders
will be reimbursed by Parent to the Escrow Fund.  The fees and expenses of
each arbitrator and the administrative fee of the American Arbitration
Association shall be allocated by the arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case

  



  

55   

     
   

  



  

may be (or, if not so allocated, shall be borne equally by Parent, on the one
hand, and the Company shareholders, out of the Escrow Fund on the other
hand).

  



  

 **Section 8.7** Shareholders Agent

  

 ** **

  

(a) Robert C. Fox, Jr. shall be constituted and appointed as the
Shareholders Agent for and on behalf of the shareholders of the Company to
give and receive notices and communications, to authorize delivery to Parent
of Escrow Cash (or other consideration, if applicable) from the Escrow Fund
in satisfaction of claims by Parent, to object to such deliveries, to agree
to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to such claims, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in
the reasonable judgment of the Shareholders Agent for the accomplishment of
the foregoing.  Such agency may be changed by the holders of a majority in
interest of the Escrow Fund from time to time upon not less than ten (10)
days prior written notice to all of the Shareholders holding an interest in
the Escrow Fund and to Parent. No bond shall be required of the
Shareholders Agent.  Notices or communications to or from the Shareholders
Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the Shareholders.

  



  

(b) The Shareholders Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as Shareholders Agent while acting in good faith and in the
exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the
advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith and
reasonableness. The Shareholders shall severally and not jointly indemnify
the Shareholders Agent and hold him harmless against any loss, liability or
expense incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on
the part of the Shareholders Agent and arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder.  In addition to
the right of indemnification as against the Shareholders individually, the
Shareholders Agent shall be entitled to indemnification from the Escrow Fund
for any such loss, liability or expense prior to any distribution thereof to
the Shareholders, but only after the Escrow Period has terminated, and only
out of funds otherwise immediately distributable to the Shareholders.

  



  

(c) The Shareholders Agent will serve without compensation but will be
reimbursed from the Escrow Fund upon occurrence for all out of pocket
expenses reasonably incurred, including expenses for lawyers, accountants and
other experts employed on behalf of the Shareholders interests in the Escrow
Fund.  In no event will the Shareholders Agent be entitled to incur
expenses reimbursable by the Escrow Fund in excess of $200,000 without the
approval of Shareholders holding a majority of the shares of the Escrow Fund
and Parent. Parents approval may be withheld in Parents sole discretion,
provided that any amounts withheld at Parents discretion shall be reimbursed
at the direction of the Shareholders Agent prior to any distribution to
Shareholders of any funds otherwise distributable.

  



  

 **Section 8.8** Actions of the Shareholders Agent

  

 ** **

  

A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders Agent shall
constitute a decision of all of the Shareholders and shall be final, binding
and conclusive upon each and every Shareholder, and the Escrow Agent and
Parent may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Shareholders Agent as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of
each

  



  

56   

     
   

  



  

and every Shareholder. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from
any liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders Agent.

  



  

 **Section 8.9** Third-Party Claims

  



  

In the event that Parent becomes aware of a third-party claim which Parent
believes may result in a demand against the Escrow Fund, Parent shall
promptly notify the Shareholders Agent of such claim, and the Shareholders
Agent and the Shareholders shall be entitled, at their expense, to
participate in any defense of such claim. Parent shall have the right to
settle any such claim; provided, however, that Parent may not effect the
settlement of any such claim without the consent of the Shareholders Agent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

 **Section 8.10** Reliance.

  

 ** **

  

No disclosure by any party (the " **Disclosing Party** ") to this Agreement
nor any investigation made by or on behalf of another party with respect to
the Disclosing Party shall be deemed to affect the other partys reliance on
the respective representations and warranties contained in this Agreement (as
modified by each partys respective Disclosure Schedule) and shall not effect
a waiver of that partys rights to indemnity as herein provided for the
breach of any of said representations and warranties.

  



  

 **Section 8.11** Indemnification by Parent

  

 ** **

  

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII, for a period
beginning at the Effective Time, and ending at 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Shareholders, together with their respective officers,
directors, agents and employees, and each person, if any, who controls or may
control any Shareholder within the meaning of the Securities Act (hereinafter
referred to individually as an " **Shareholder** **Indemnified Person** " and
collectively as " **Shareholder** **Indemnified Persons** ") from and against:
Any and all losses, costs, damages, obligations, liabilities, fines,
penalties, judgments, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
legal and other professional fees, costs and expenses incurred in
investigating, preparing, defending against or prosecuting any claim, demand,
suit, action, cause of action, arbitration, investigation or proceeding)
arising out of any material misrepresentation or material breach of, or
default in connection with, any of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements given or made by the Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement or any exhibit or schedule to this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement (collectively, " **Shareholder**   **Damages** ").

  



  

(b) All indemnification obligations of Parent shall be satisfied in cash, by
payment to the Shareholders Agent for further distribution by the
Shareholders Agent to the Shareholders, or at the election of the
Shareholders Agent to the Escrow Agent for further distribution by the
Escrow Agent to the Shareholders. Notwithstanding any instruction of
the Shareholders Agent to deliver such indemnification proceeds to the
Escrow Agent, such indemnification proceeds

  



  

57   

     
   

  



  

shall not become a part of the Escrow Fund, but shall be delivered solely for
further distribution the Shareholders.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other
Ancillary Agreement, the Shareholders Agent shall have the authority to
exercise on behalf of the Shareholders all applicable remedies available at
law or in equity.

  



  

(d) The parties agree that there shall not be any multiple recovery for any
Shareholder Damages. Except in the case of fraud, in no event shall the
aggregate liability of Parent under this Section 8.11 exceed $3,000,000. This
Section 8.11 represents the sole remedy for any claim by any Shareholder
Indemnified Person relating to Shareholder Damages. No claim may be presented
relating to Shareholder Damages after the first anniversary of the Closing
Date. Parent shall not be liable on any individual claim for Shareholder
Damages, unless the individual claim exceeds $50,000.

Shareholders Agent, this Agreement shall nonetheless be binding upon Parent,
Company and Merger Sub, and such parties thereto shall endeavor in good faith
to add promptly after the date hereof a party as Shareholders Agent in

the date hereof and before the Closing with the consent of the Company and
without the consent of Parent to designate and add as a party for the limited
purposes specified in this Agreement, a Shareholders Agent and to add
identifying information and address information in the appropriate sections
of this Agreement; provided that if the Shareholders Agent is not a member
