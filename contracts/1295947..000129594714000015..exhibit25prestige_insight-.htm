Representative may, within forty-five (45) days after the Sellers
Representative's receipt thereof (the "Notice Period"), give written notice
(the "Notice") to Buyer specifying in reasonable detail such objections and
the basis therefor, and the calculations which the Sellers Representative has
determined in good faith are necessary to eliminate such objections. If the
Sellers Representative does not deliver the Notice within the Notice Period,
Buyer's determinations in the Closing Date Statement shall be final, binding
and conclusive on the Parties. If the Sellers Representative provides the
Notice within the Notice Period, the Sellers Representative and Buyer shall
negotiate in good faith during the fifteen (15)-Business Day period after the
date of Buyer's receipt of the Notice (the "Resolution Period") to resolve any
disputes regarding the Closing Date Statement. If the Sellers Representative
and Buyer are unable to resolve all such disputes within the Resolution
Period, then within fifteen (15) Business Days after the expiration of the
Resolution Period, all unresolved disputes shall be submitted to an
independent accounting firm, to be mutually agreed upon by the Sellers
Representative and Buyer (the "Arbitrator"), who shall be engaged to provide a
final, binding and conclusive resolution of all such unresolved disputes

act as an independent arbitrator to determine, based solely on the
presentations by the Sellers Representative and Buyer and not by independent
review, only those issues that remain in dispute, and the Arbitrator may not
assign a value to any particular item that is greater than the greatest value
for such item claimed by either Buyer or the Sellers Representative or less
than the lowest value for such item claimed by either Buyer or the Sellers
Representative, in

each case, as presented to the Arbitrator. Upon the final resolution of all
such disputed items, the Arbitrator shall issue a written report detailing its
final calculation of such disputed items. The determination of the Arbitrator
shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties, and the fees and
expenses of the Arbitrator shall be borne by the Sellers (on the one hand) and
Buyer (on the other hand) in proportion to the amounts by which their
proposals differed from the Arbitrator's final determination. In connection
with the resolution of any such dispute, each Party (the Sellers on the one
hand and Buyer on the other) shall pay its own fees and expenses, including
legal, accounting and consultant fees and expenses. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, any disputes regarding amounts shown in the
Closing Date Statement shall be resolved as set forth in this Section 2.4.

expiration of the Notice Period, if no Notice is delivered by the Sellers
Representative to Buyer by such date, and (y) the final resolution of all
disputes regarding the Closing Date Statement pursuant to Section 2.4.1 above:

2.4.2.1 if such post-Closing adjustments result in an Estimated Payment
Increase, then (i) Buyer shall pay each Seller (or, in the case of a Seller
that is an Optionholder, to the Company for disbursement to such Optionholder
in accordance with the Company's ordinary payroll practices and Section 2.2),
such Seller's Pro Rata Portion of the Estimated Payment Increase by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the bank accounts designated by the
Sellers Representative (or, in the case of a Seller that is an Optionholder,
the Company) and (ii) Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall direct the
Escrow Agent to disburse to the Sellers Representative (for the account of the
Sellers) the NWC Escrow Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to a bank account designated by the Sellers Representative; and

2.4.2.2 if such post-Closing adjustments result in an Estimated Payment
Decrease, then Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall direct the Escrow
Agent to disburse to Buyer an amount equal to the Estimated Payment Decrease
from the NWC Escrow Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
a bank account designated by Buyer; provided that, if the NWC Escrow Amount is
insufficient to satisfy any such Estimated Payment Decrease (a "NWC Escrow
Shortfall"), then at Buyer's option (i) Buyer and the Sellers Representative
shall direct the Escrow Agent to disburse to Buyer an amount equal to the NWC
Escrow Shortfall (or any portion thereof) from the Indemnity Escrow Amount by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by
Buyer and/or (ii) Buyer may recover the NWC Escrow Shortfall (or any portion
thereof) directly from the Sellers and the Sellers in such event shall be
severally but not jointly obligated, in accordance with each Seller's Pro Rata
Portion, to pay to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a
bank account designated by Buyer the NWC Escrow Shortfall or portion thereof,
as applicable.

and warranties that address matters only as of a particular date or only with
respect to a specific period of time, which need only be true and correct in

agreements required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it
on or prior to the Closing, except where Buyer's failure to have so performed
or complied, individually or in the aggregate, does not constitute a Material

Tax Matters. 

| 
---|--- 

10.1

|

Tax Indemnification. From and after the Closing, the Buyer Parties shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Sellers on a several but not joint basis
in accordance with each Seller's Pro Rata Portion from and against any Pre-
Closing Taxes (which, for purposes of this Section 10.1, shall include any
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in preparing any Tax Returns with
respect thereto or conducting any audit arising therefrom). 

| 
---|--- 

10.2

|

Straddle Period. In the case of any Straddle Period, (i) the amount of any
Taxes based upon or measured by income or receipts of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Period shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-
through entity in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time), and (ii) the
amount of other Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for a Straddle
Period which relate to the Pre-Closing Period shall be deemed to be the amount
of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period. 

|

10.3

|

Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns. 

10.3.7 The Sellers Representative shall, at the Sellers' cost and expense,
prepare, or cause to be prepared all Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns required
to be filed by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries after the
Closing Date. All such Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns shall be prepared and
filed in a manner that is consistent with the prior practice of the Company or
its applicable Subsidiary (as the case may be), except as required by
applicable Law. The Sellers Representative shall deliver or cause to be
delivered drafts of all such Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns to Buyer for its
review and comment at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date of any
such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return. The Sellers Representative shall
incorporate any comments or changes reasonably requested by Buyer at least
five (5) days prior to the due date of any such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law. The Sellers Representative shall
timely file all such Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns; provided, however, if any
such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return is filed after the Closing and the Sellers
Representative is not authorized to execute and file such Pre-Closing Period
Tax Return by applicable Law, Buyer shall execute and file (or cause to be
filed) such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return (as finally determined pursuant to
this Section 10.3.1) with the appropriate Taxing Authority. The Sellers
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) shall pay all Pre-Closing Taxes due
and payable in respect of all Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns of each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that if any Pre-Closing
Period Tax Return is due after the Closing and is to be filed (or caused to be
filed) by Buyer, the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) shall
pay (in immediately available funds) to Buyer the amount of all Pre-Closing
Taxes due and payable with respect of such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return
(determined pursuant to this Section 10.3.1) no later than three (3) Business
Days prior to the earlier of the date such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return is
filed or the due date of such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return.

10.3.8 Buyer shall, at its expense, prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Straddle Period Tax Returns required to be
filed by the Company and its Subsidiaries. All Straddle Period Tax Returns
shall be prepared and filed in a manner that is consistent with the prior
practice of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary (as the case may be),
except as required by applicable Law. Buyer shall deliver or cause to be
delivered drafts of all Straddle Period Tax Returns to the Sellers
Representative for its review and comment at least fifteen (15) days prior to
the due date



\- 56 -

of any such Straddle Period Tax Return. Buyer shall incorporate any comments
or changes reasonably requested by Sellers Representative at least five (5)
days prior to the due date of any such Straddle Period Tax Return, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law. No later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the earlier of the date a Straddle Period Tax Return of any of the
Company or its Subsidiaries is filed or the due date of such Straddle Period
Tax Return, the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) shall pay
(in immediately available funds) to Buyer the amount of all Pre-Closing Taxes
required to be paid with respect to such Straddle Period Tax Return
(determined pursuant to this Section 10.3.2).

| 
---|--- 

10.4

|

Post-Closing Actions. Neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer (including,
after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall file, amend, re-
file or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any periods (or portion thereof) ending
on or before the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of the
Sellers Representative, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The
Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) shall be entitled to receive
payment from Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing,
the Company and its Subsidiaries) of any refund of Pre-Closing Taxes
(including refunds arising by reason of amended Tax Returns filed after the
Closing Date or otherwise, except to the extent attributable to any Tax
attribute arising in a Tax period beginning after the Closing Date), but
excluding any Tax receivables included in the calculation of the Actual Net
Working Capital (as finally determined), with respect to any Tax period ending
on or prior to the Closing Date and the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle
Period of the Company and its Subsidiaries that is actually received by Buyer
or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries), as additional consideration in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer and its Subsidiaries
(including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall
cooperate with the Sellers Representative, to the extent reasonably requested,
in obtaining any refund to which the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the
Sellers) is entitled under this Section 10.4. All such refunds shall be
claimed in cash rather than as a credit against future Tax Liabilities.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that
a refund to which the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) is
entitled under this Section 10.4 is subsequently determined by any Taxing
Authority to be less than the amount paid by Buyer to the Sellers
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers), the Sellers Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers) shall promptly return any such disallowed amounts (plus
any interest in respect of such disallowed refunds owed to a Taxing Authority)
to Buyer. 

| 
---|--- 

10.5

|

Cooperation and Records Retention. The Sellers Representative and Buyer shall
(i) each provide the other, and Buyer shall, after the Closing, cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to provide the Sellers Representative, with such
assistance as may be reasonably requested by any of them in connection with
the preparation of any Tax Return, audit, or other examination by any Taxing
Authority or judicial or administrative proceedings relating to any Liability
for Taxes, (ii) each retain and provide the other, and Buyer shall, after the
Closing, cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to retain and provide the
Sellers Representative with, any records or other information that may be
relevant to such Tax Return, audit or examination, proceeding, or
determination, and (iii) each provide the other with any final determination
of any such audit or examination, proceeding, or determination that affects
any amount required to be shown on any Tax Return of the other or the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries for any period. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Buyer shall retain, and shall, after the Closing, cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to retain, and the Sellers Representative shall
retain, until the applicable statutes of limitations (including any
extensions) have expired, copies of all Tax Returns, supporting work
schedules, and other records or information that may be relevant to such
returns for all Tax periods or portions thereof ending before or including the
Closing Date, and shall provide copies of such records at the other Party's

Tax Proceedings. 

10.6.8 Buyer shall deliver a written notice to the Sellers Representative
promptly following any demand, claim, or notice of commencement of a claim,
proposed adjustment, assessment, audit, examination or other administrative or
court proceeding with respect to Taxes of any of the Company or its
Subsidiaries for which the Sellers may be liable ("Tax Contest") and shall
describe in reasonable detail (to the extent known by Buyer) the facts
constituting the basis for such Tax Contest, the nature of the relief sought,
and the amount of the claimed Taxes, if any (the "Tax Claim Notice");
provided, however, that the failure or delay to so notify the Seller
Representative shall not relieve the Sellers of any Liability that the Sellers
may have to Buyer, except to the extent that the Sellers Representative
demonstrates that the Sellers are materially and adversely prejudiced thereby.

10.6.9 With respect to Tax Contests for Taxes of each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Period, the Sellers Representative may elect to
assume and control the defense of such Tax Contest by written notice to Buyer
within thirty (30) days after delivery by Buyer to the Sellers Representative
of the Tax Claim Notice. If the Sellers Representative elects to assume and
control the defense of such Tax Contest, the Sellers Representative (i) shall
(on behalf of the Sellers) bear its own costs and expenses, (ii) shall be
entitled to engage its own counsel and (iii) may (A) pursue or forego any and
all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any
Taxing Authority, (B) either pay (on behalf of the Sellers) the Tax claimed or
sue for refund where applicable Law permits such refund suit or (C) contest,
settle or compromise the Tax Contest in any permissible manner; provided,
however, that the Sellers Representative shall not settle or compromise (or
take other actions described herein with respect to) any Tax Contest without
the prior written consent of Buyer (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). If the Sellers Representative elects to
assume the defense of any Tax Contest, the Sellers Representative shall (x)
keep Buyer reasonably informed of all material developments and events
relating to such Tax Contest (including promptly forwarding copies to Buyer of
any related correspondence and providing Buyer with an opportunity to review
and comment on any material correspondence before the Sellers Representative
sends such correspondence to any Taxing Authority), (y) consult with Buyer in
connection with the defense or prosecution of any such Tax Contest and (z)
provide such cooperation and information as Buyer shall reasonably request,
and Buyer shall have the right to participate in (but not control) the defense
of such Tax Contest (including participating in any discussions with the
applicable Taxing Authorities regarding such Tax Contests).

10.6.10 In connection with any Tax Contest that relates to Taxes of each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Period that (i) the Sellers
Representative does not timely elect to control pursuant to Section 10.6.2 or
(ii) the Sellers Representative fails to diligently defend, such Tax Contest
shall be controlled by Buyer (and the Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Buyer relating to a Tax Contest
described in this Section 10.6.3) and the Sellers and the Sellers
Representative agree to cooperate with Buyer in pursuing such Tax Contest. In
connection with any Tax Contest that is described in this Section 10.6.3 and
controlled by Buyer, Buyer shall (x) keep the Sellers Representative informed
of all material developments and events relating to such Tax Contest
(including promptly forwarding copies to the Sellers Representative of any
related correspondence and shall provide the Sellers Representative with an
opportunity to review and comment on any material correspondence before Buyer
sends such correspondence to any Taxing Authority), (y) consult with the
Sellers Representative in connection with the defense or prosecution of any
such Tax Contest and (z) provide such cooperation and information as the
Sellers Representative shall reasonably request, and, at the cost and expense
of the Sellers, the Sellers Representative shall have the right to participate

in any discussions with the applicable Taxing Authorities regarding such Tax
Contests); provided, however, that Buyer shall not settle or compromise (or
take other actions described herein with respect to) any such Tax Contest
without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

10.6.11 In connection with any Tax Contest for Taxes of each of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period, such Tax Contest shall be
controlled by Buyer; provided, that Buyer shall not settle or compromise (or
take such other actions described herein with respect to) any Tax Contest
without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyer shall (x) keep
the Sellers Representative informed of all material developments and events
relating to such Tax Contest (including promptly forwarding copies to the
Sellers Representative of any related correspondence and shall provide the
Sellers Representative with an opportunity to review and comment on any
material correspondence before Buyer sends such correspondence to any Taxing
Authority), (y) consult with the Sellers Representative in connection with the
defense or prosecution of any such Tax Contest and (z) provide such
cooperation and information as the Sellers Representative shall reasonably
request, and, at the cost and expense of the Sellers, the Sellers
Representative shall have the right to participate in (but not control) the
defense of such Tax Contest (including participating in any discussions with
the applicable Taxing Authorities regarding such Tax Contests).

the procedures for all Tax Contests shall be governed exclusively by this
Section 10.6 (and not Section 11.6).

10.7

|

Adjustments to the Purchase Price. Buyer and the Sellers agree to treat any
amounts payable after the Closing by the Sellers to Buyer (or by Buyer to the
Sellers) pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment to the purchase price
payable hereunder, unless a final determination by the appropriate Taxing
Authority or court of competent jurisdiction causes any such payment not to be
treated as an adjustment to the purchase price payable hereunder for Tax
purposes. 

| 
---|--- 

10.8

|

Transfer Taxes. Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand,
shall each pay one-half of all transfer, sales, use, gains, documentary,

Indemnification by the Sellers. 

11.2.9 Each Seller severally, as to itself only, shall indemnify, protect,

against any Losses any of the Buyer Parties may suffer, sustain or become
subject to, through and after the date of the claim for indemnification
resulting from, arising from or out of, relating to, or caused by (i) any
breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of such Seller in

covenant or agreement that is specific only to that Seller (and not a covenant
or agreement applicable to all of the Sellers) set forth in this Agreement by
such Seller.

11.2.10 The Sellers shall, on a several but not joint basis in accordance with
each Seller's Pro Rata Portion, indemnify, protect, defend and hold and save

Parties may suffer after the end of the applicable survival period (if any),
if a claim is made before the end of the applicable survival period (if any),

Agreement; (iii) any Company Transaction Expenses or Indebtedness that are not
taken into account in the calculation of the payments and adjustments set

Limitations on Indemnification. The indemnification obligations of the Sellers
set forth in Section 11.2 shall be subject to the following limitations: 

11.5.13 Subject to the other limitations expressly set forth in this
Agreement, the aggregate liability of the Sellers to indemnify the Buyer
Parties from and against any Buyer Indemnifiable Losses arising under Section
11.2.1(i) and Section 11.2.2(i) shall not, in any event, exceed Thirty-Two
Million Dollars ($32,000,000) (the "Cap"); provided, however, that, subject to
Section 11.4, the Cap shall not apply to (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any
of the Fundamental Representations, or (ii) any claims relating to actual,
intentional (and not constructive or any other type of) fraud.

11.5.14 Subject to the other limitations expressly set forth in this
Agreement, the Sellers will not have any obligation to indemnify the Buyer
Parties with respect to any Buyer Indemnifiable Losses arising under Section
11.2.2(i) until the Buyer Parties shall first have suffered aggregate Buyer
Indemnifiable Losses relating thereto in excess of Three Million Seven Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($3,700,000) (the "Basket") (at which point the Sellers will
be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Parties only for Buyer Indemnifiable
Losses in excess of the Basket); provided, however, that the limitation set
forth in this Section 11.5.2 shall not apply to (i) any breach or inaccuracy
of any of the Fundamental Representations or any of the representations and
warranties in Section 5.13, or (ii) any claims relating to actual, intentional
(and not constructive or any other type of) fraud.

11.5.15 Except for any Indemnifiable Loss arising under Section 10.1, Section
11.2.1(ii), Section 11.2.2(i) with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any
of the representations and warranties in Section 5.13 only, Section
11.2.2(ii), Section 11.2.2(iii), Section 11.2.2(iv), Section 11.2.2(v), or
Section 11.3(ii) (for which, in each case, the limitations in this Section
11.5.3 shall not apply), no Indemnifiable Loss shall be payable unless such
Indemnifiable Loss (together with all other Indemnifiable Losses that arise
out of substantially similar facts or circumstances) equals or exceeds Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($50,000), and any Indemnifiable Loss which is not payable
because of such Fifty Thousand Dollar ($50,000) threshold shall not be taken
into account in determining if the Buyer Parties have suffered aggregate Buyer
Indemnifiable Losses in excess of the Basket in Section 11.5.2 above.

11.5.16 Subject to the other limitations expressly set forth in this
Agreement, the Sellers will not have any obligation to indemnify the Buyer
Parties with respect to any Buyer Indemnifiable Losses arising under Section
11.2.2(i) with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any of the
representations and warranties in Section 5.13 until the Buyer Parties shall
first have suffered aggregate Buyer Indemnifiable Losses relating thereto in
excess of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) (at which point the
Sellers will be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Parties only for such Buyer
Indemnifiable Losses in excess of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($250,000); provided, however,

11.5.17 The Sellers shall have no obligation to indemnify the Buyer Parties
from and against any Losses consisting of or relating to any Taxes with
respect to any taxable period, or the portion of any Straddle Period,
beginning after the Closing Date as a result of any breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.9 other than the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.9.2, 5.9.10, 5.9.12 or
5.9.13 of such Section 5.9.

11.5.18 Neither a Party's good faith judgment as to whether a matter meets a
"materiality" or Material Adverse Effect threshold under a representation or
warranty qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, respectively,
nor a Party's good faith estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of
financial statements shall be considered fraud for the purposes of this
Agreement.

Indemnification Procedures. 

11.6.3 Other than a claim involving Taxes, which procedure is set forth in and
which shall be governed exclusively by Section 10, and other than a matter set
forth in Section 11.2.2 of the Disclosure Schedule, if any third party (i.e.,
other than a Buyer Party or a Seller Party) shall notify any Party (the
"Indemnified Party") with respect to any matter (a "Third Party Claim") which
may give rise to a claim by such Indemnified Party for indemnification against
any other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") under this Agreement, then the
Indemnified Party shall promptly upon becoming aware of any such claim give
each Indemnifying Party written notice describing such claim and, to the
extent known, the nature and amount of such Indemnifiable Loss; provided,
however, that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party promptly shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the
extent such failure shall have materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

11.6.4 Any Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend the Indemnified
Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of the Indemnifying Party's
choice, reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, so long as (i) the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party, within ten (10) Business
Days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim to
the Indemnifying Party (or by such earlier date as may be necessary under
applicable procedural rules in order to file a timely appearance and response)
that the Indemnifying Party is assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim,
(ii) the Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified Party with evidence
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party has
and is reasonably likely at all times to continue to have the financial
resources to defend against the Third Party Claim and fulfill its
indemnification obligations hereunder with respect thereto, (iii) the
Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and
diligently, and (iv) the Third Party Claim (x) does not seek injunctive
relief, specific performance or other similar equitable relief as the primary
remedy, has not been brought by any Governmental Authority, and does not
allege any criminal allegations, (y) is not one in which the Indemnifying
Party is also a party and, in the opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party,
there may be legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are
different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party, or
(z) does not involve a claim which, upon petition by the Indemnified Party,
the appropriate court rules that the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing
to vigorously prosecute or defend. Notwithstanding anything in this Section
11.6.2 to the contrary, the Sellers Representative shall have the sole and
exclusive authority to conduct the defense of any matter set forth in Section
11.2.2 of the Disclosure Schedule.

11.6.5 So long as the conditions set forth in Section 11.6.2 are and remain
satisfied, then (i) the Indemnifying Party may conduct the defense of the

Calculation of Indemnification Payments. 

11.7.1 The amount of any Indemnifiable Loss payable under this Section 11 by
the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnified Party from insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to
be responsible for such Indemnifiable Loss ("Alternative Arrangements"), in
each case net of the following (collectively, "Collection Expenses"): (i)
costs and expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in
procuring such recovery, (ii) any retro-premium obligations, increases in
premiums or premium adjustments to the extent attributable to such recovery,
and (iii) deductibles and other amounts incurred in connection with such
recovery. If the Indemnified Party actually receives any amounts under any
Alternative Arrangements with respect to such Indemnifiable Loss, subsequent
to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified
Party shall promptly (but in any event within ten (10) Business Days after
such determination) reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any indemnification
payment actually made to such Indemnified Party by such Indemnifying Party in
connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount
actually received by the Indemnified Party, in each case, net of associated
Collection Expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, no Buyer Party will be entitled to be indemnified under this
Section 11 for any Loss to the extent that it has been taken into account in
the final determination of Actual Company Indebtedness, Actual Company
Transaction Expenses or Actual Net Working Capital pursuant to Section 2.4
hereof.

11.7.2 Indemnification payments under Section 10 and this Section 11 shall be
paid by the Indemnifying Party without reduction for any Tax Benefits
available to the Indemnified Party. However, to the extent that the
Indemnified Party recognizes Tax Benefits as a result of any Losses in any Tax
year in which or prior to which such Losses were incurred (or in any of the
two (2) immediately succeeding Tax years), the Indemnified Party shall pay the
amount of such Tax Benefits (but not in excess of the indemnification payment
or payments actually received from the Indemnifying Party with respect to such
Losses) to the Indemnifying Party as such Tax Benefits are actually recognized
by the Indemnified Party. For this purpose, the Indemnified Party shall be
deemed to recognize a tax benefit ("Tax Benefit") with respect to a taxable
year if, and to the extent that, the Indemnified Party's cumulative Liability
for Taxes through the end of such taxable year, calculated by excluding any
Tax items attributable to the Losses from all taxable years, exceeds the
Indemnified Party's actual cumulative Liability for Taxes through the end of
such taxable year, calculated by taking into account any Tax items



\- 63 -

US_ACTIVE-116890188.17-330225-00006

* * *





attributable to the Losses for all taxable years (to the extent permitted by
relevant Tax law and treating such Tax items as the last items claimed for any
taxable year).

11.7.3 Subject to the other provisions regarding indemnification contained
herein, if the Sellers are obligated to reimburse or compensate the Buyer
Parties for any Buyer Indemnifiable Losses in connection with a claim for
indemnification by the Buyer Parties under Section 10.1, Section 11.2.2(i),
Section 11.2.2(ii), Section 11.2.2(iv) or Section 11.2.2(v), then
indemnification for such Losses, subject to the applicable limitations, if
any, set forth in Section 11.5, shall be satisfied first from the then
remaining balance of the Indemnity Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account and
then, to the extent there are insufficient funds in the portion of the Escrow
Account attributable to the Indemnity Escrow Amount, directly from the Sellers
on a several but not joint basis in accordance with each Seller's Pro Rata
Portion; provided, that, if (i) the Sellers are obligated to reimburse or
compensate the Buyer Parties for any Buyer Indemnifiable Losses in connection
with a claim for indemnification by the Buyer Parties under Section 10.1,
Section 11.2.2(i), Section 11.2.2(ii), Section 11.2.2(iv) or Section
11.2.2(v), (ii) there are insufficient funds in the portion of the Escrow
Account attributable to the Indemnity Escrow Amount to satisfy such Buyer
Indemnifiable Losses, and (iii) there has previously been a distribution from
the portion of the Escrow Account attributable to the Indemnity Escrow Amount
to satisfy any Liabilities for Taxes pursuant to Section 10.1 or Section
11.2.2(iv), each Seller shall promptly following any final determination of
the amount of any such insufficiency, and in any event within three (3)
Business Days thereof, contribute, pursuant to the wire transfer instructions
provided by the Sellers Representative, which wire transfer instructions the
Sellers Representative shall provide to the Sellers within the aforementioned
time period, an amount equal to such Seller's Pro Rata Portion of such
insufficiency to the Escrow Agent to thereafter be held and disbursed by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement.

No Contribution or Circular Recovery. The Sellers shall not have any right of
contribution against Buyer, the Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries
or any other Buyer Party with respect to any Buyer Indemnifiable Losses. The
Sellers hereby agree that they shall not make any claim for indemnification
against Buyer, the Company (following the Closing), any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any other Buyer Party by reason of the fact that the Sellers
or any of their agents or other representatives was a controlling person,
equityholder director, officer, manager, employee, agent or other
representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or was serving as
such for another Person at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (whether such claim is for losses of any kind or otherwise and
whether such claim is pursuant to any Law, Organizational Document,
contractual obligation or otherwise) with respect to any claim brought by
Buyer against such Person pursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement.

Certain Determinations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach
and the amount of any Losses that are the subject matter of a claim for
indemnification hereunder, each representation and warranty in this Agreement
shall be read without regard and without giving effect to the term(s)
"material" or "Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualifiers as if such words
and surrounding related words (e.g. "reasonably be expected to," "could have"
and similar restrictions and qualifiers) were deleted from such representation
and warranty, (i) except where any such provision requires disclosure of lists
of items of a material nature or above a specified threshold in which case
such provision shall not deleted for purposes of determining the lists of
items which must be disclosed, including with respect to the definition of
"Material Contracts" and all uses of such defined term, and (ii) except for
purposes of Section 5.23.

Mitigation. Each Party seeking indemnification hereunder shall use Reasonable
Efforts to mitigate any Losses as soon as reasonably practicable after such

Buyer Parties and the Seller Parties to indemnification pursuant to Section 10

of this Agreement or the transactions set forth herein (including, without
limitation, with respect to any Environmental Laws) (other than disputes under
Section 2.4, which disputes under Section 2.4 shall be resolved in accordance
with the dispute resolution mechanism set forth in Section 2.4).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) nothing herein shall limit or impair any
party's right to obtain specific performance or other injunctive relief with
respect to any breach or anticipated breach of this Agreement or limit a cause

other type of) fraud, and (ii) the limitations on remedies contained in this

Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by

written approval of the other Parties, except that Buyer may assign (i) its
rights and obligations hereunder to any of its Affiliates (provided, that no

executed and delivered in accordance herewith, along with any amendments

binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No Party hereto shall raise the use of a facsimile
machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" or similar format data file to deliver
a signature to this Agreement or any amendment hereto or the fact that such
signature was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile
machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" or similar format data file as a
defense to the formation or enforceability of a contract, and each Party
hereto forever waives any such defense.

Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the domestic laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any
choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. 

| 
---|--- 

13.11

|

CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE APPLICABLE STATE
OR FEDERAL COURTS SITTING IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE, FOR PURPOSES OF ALL LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND EACH OF THE PARTIES AGREES NOT TO COMMENCE ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING RELATED THERETO EXCEPT IN SUCH COURTS. EACH OF THE PARTIES
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION
WHICH HE, SHE OR IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF THE VENUE OF
ANY SUCH COURT OR THAT SUCH ACTION HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, EACH OF
THE PARTIES HERETO: (I) AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT BRING OR SUPPORT ANY PERSON IN
ANY ACTION OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION, WHETHER

IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, AGAINST ANY
OF THE DEBT FINANCING SOURCES IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE DEBT COMMITMENT

AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER, ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES
OF ACTION (WHETHER AT LAW, IN EQUITY, IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE)
AGAINST ANY OF THE DEBT FINANCING SOURCES IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR THE
FINANCINGS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, SHALL BE EXCLUSIVELY GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,
WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO PRINCIPLES OR RULES OR CONFLICT OF LAWS TO THE EXTENT
SUCH PRINCIPLES OR RULES WOULD REQUIRE OR PERMIT THE APPLICATION OF LAWS OF
ANOTHER JURISDICTION.

| 
---|--- 

13.12

|

WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH OF THE PARTIES
HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS OR ANY COURSE OF
CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALINGS, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS
OF ANY OF THE PARTIES IN CONNECTION HEREWITH (INCLUDING IN THE CASE OF ANY
ACTION AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE (OR ITS AFFILIATES) IN CONNECTION
WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED UNDER THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER). THE
PARTIES HEREBY EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT
FOR THEM TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT. 

| 
---|--- 

13.13

|

Amendments and Waivers. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall
be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Buyer, the Company
and the Sellers Representative. No waiver by any Party of any default,
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether
intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent
default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or
affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent
occurrence of such kind. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Sections 13.5, 13.11, 13.12 and this 13.13 hereof (and any provision
of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification, waiver or
termination of such provision would modify the substance of Sections 13.5,
13.10 13.11, 13.12 and this 13.13 hereof) may not be amended, modified, waived
or terminated in a manner that impacts or is adverse in any respect to the
Debt Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing
Sources party to the Debt Commitment Letter on the date of this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

13.14

|

Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is
invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce
the scope, duration, 

 

\- 73 -

US_ACTIVE-116890188.17-330225-00006

* * *





or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to
replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing
the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time
within which the judgment may be appealed.

| 
---|--- 

13.15

|

Expenses. Each of the Parties will bear such Party's own costs and expenses
(including fees and expenses of legal counsel, investment bankers, brokers or
other representatives or consultants) incurred in connection with the
negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether or not such transactions are consummated;
provided, however, for purposes of clarity, in the event of a conflict between
the foregoing and Section 1.1, Section 7.6.4, Section 10.8, or Section 13.2,
then such other provision shall control. 

| 
---|--- 

13.16

|

Further Assurances. Each of Buyer, the Company, the Sellers and the Sellers
Representative shall use Reasonable Efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable in compliance with applicable Laws to consummate and make effective,
as soon as reasonably practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby,
including, as and when reasonably requested by any Party hereto, executing and
delivering, or causing to be executed and delivered, all such documents and
instruments, and taking, or causing to be taken, all such further or other
actions as the requesting Party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to
evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

13.17

|

Construction. The Parties have jointly participated in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. In the event of an ambiguity or question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the Parties and no presumptions or burdens of proof shall arise
favoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement. Any reference to "Sellers" herein shall be deemed to refer
both to each Seller on an individual basis and also to the Sellers on a
collective basis. As used in this Agreement, the words "including" and
"include" shall mean by way of example and not by way of limitation and shall
be deemed to be followed by the phrase "without limitation" in each instance,
the word "or" is not exclusive and the words "herein," "hereof," "hereby,"
"hereto" and "hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole. Each defined term
used in this Agreement shall have a comparable meaning when used in its plural
or singular form. Unless the context otherwise requires, references herein:
(i) to Sections, Exhibits and Schedules mean the Sections of and the Exhibits
and Schedules attached to this Agreement, (ii) to an agreement, instrument or
document means such agreement, instrument or document as amended, supplemented
and modified from time to time to the extent permitted by the provisions
thereof and not prohibited by this Agreement and (iii) to a Law means such Law
as amended from time to time and includes any successor legislation thereto.
The headings and captions used in this Agreement, or in any Schedule or
Exhibit hereto are for convenience of reference only and do not constitute a
part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit, characterize or in
any way affect any provision of this Agreement or any Schedule or Exhibit
hereto. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit attached hereto
and not otherwise defined therein shall have the meanings set forth in this
Agreement. All amounts payable hereunder and set forth in this Agreement are
expressed in U.S. dollars, and all references to dollars (or the symbol "$")
contained herein shall be deemed to refer to United States dollars. The
Parties intend that each representation, warranty and agreement contained in
this Agreement will have independent significance. If any Party has breached
any representation, warranty or agreement in any respect, the fact that there
exists another representation, warranty or agreement relating to the same
subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) that the
Party has not breached will not detract from or mitigate the fact that the
Party is in breach of the first representation, warranty or agreement.

13.18

|

Directors and Officers. For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Buyer
shall not, and shall not permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to,
amend, repeal or modify (in a manner adverse to the beneficiary thereof) any
provision in such Person's certificates of incorporation, bylaws, limited
liability company agreement or comparable governing documents relating to the
exculpation or indemnification of, or advancement of expenses to, any
officers, directors or managers, it being the intent of the parties hereto
that the officers, directors and managers of the Company and its Subsidiaries
on the date hereof shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation,
indemnification and advancement to the full extent of the Law. The provisions
of this Section 13.18 are intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable
by, any Person who is on the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Closing
Date, an officer, director or manager of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company and each such Person's estate, heirs and representatives, and are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have pursuant to law, the
organizational documents of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company,
contract or otherwise.
