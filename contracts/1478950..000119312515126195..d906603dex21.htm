to the stockholders of the Company and the assumption of all of the Companys
liabilities, followed by the distribution of such Merger Consideration to the
stockholders of the Company in liquidation of the Company pursuant to Section
331 and Section 562 of the Code, and that this Agreement be, and is hereby
adopted as, a "plan of liquidation" of the Company for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, and (b) the Partnership Merger shall be treated as (i) the sale of
the Partnership Common Units by the Cash-Out Limited Partners to the
Surviving Company, and (ii) the contribution of Partnership Common Units by
the Roll-Over Limited Partner in the Partnership in exchange for New
Partnership Preferred Units of the Surviving Partnership in a tax-deferred
transaction under Section 721 of the Code to the extent applicable to the
exchange by each Roll-Over Limited Partner. The parties hereto agree not to
take any position on any tax return that is inconsistent with the foregoing
for all U.S. federal, and, if applicable, state and local tax purposes.

ARTICLE II.

 

MERGER CONSIDERATION; COMPANY STOCK; PARTNERSHIP UNITS

 

Section 2.1 _Company Common Share Merger Consideration; Effect on
Company Stock_. 

(a) _Shares of Merger Sub_. At the Company Merger Effective Time, by
virtue of the Company Merger and without any action on the part of any holder
thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time
shall remain as one issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company.

 

(b) _Company Common Share Merger Consideration; Conversion of Company
Common Shares_. At the Closing, Parent shall pay to the holders of common
stock,

 



5  par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (each, a " _Company Common Share_

action on the part of any holder thereof, each Company Common Share (other

Subsidiary Common Shares (as defined below)) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time shall automatically be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to Fifteen

and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share (each, a " _Surviving Company Common Share_
"), of the Surviving Company. From and after the Company Merger Effective
Time, all certificates representing Company Common Shares owned by any direct
or indirect Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Company into which they were converted
in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

(d) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned and Merger Sub-Owned Company Common
Shares_. Each issued and outstanding Company Common Share that is owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Company Merger Effective Time (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_

exist, and no cash, Company Common Share or other consideration shall be
delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

 

(e) _Cancellation of Company Common Shares_. As of the Company Merger
Effective Time, all Company Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately

holder of a Company Common Share (other than Excluded Shares, if any, and
Company Subsidiary Common Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect
to such interest, except the right to receive the Per Company Common Share
Merger Consideration, without interest, or, with respect to the Company

Share per Company Subsidiary Common Share.

 

Section 2.2 _Effect on Company Preferred Shares_. At the Company Merger
Effective Time, by virtue of the Company Merger and without any action on the
part of any holder thereof, (i) each share of 7.00% Series A Cumulative

6   _Preferred Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time shall automatically be converted into the right

defined below) and (ii) each share of 8.125% Series B Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value (each, a " _Company Series B Preferred Share_
" and, collectively, the " _Company Series B_ _Preferred Stock_ "), issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time shall
automatically be converted into the right to receive the Per Company Series B
Preferred Share Merger Consideration (as defined below).

Section 2.3 _Restricted Shares_. Immediately prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time, each restricted share granted under the Companys and
Partnerships 2014 amendment and restatement of the 2010 Equity Incentive
Award Plan (the " _Company Share Incentive Plan_ ," and such restricted
shares, " _Restricted Shares_ ") shall be fully vested and non-forfeitable,
and all Company Common Shares represented thereby shall be considered
outstanding for all purposes of this Agreement and subject to the right to
receive the Per Company Common Share Merger Consideration, less any applicable
income and employment withholding Taxes.

 

Section 2.4 _Partnership Merger Consideration; Effect on Partnership
Units_.

 

(a) At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the
Partnership Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof,
each Partnership Common Unit held by a Minority Limited Partner issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, shall be converted
into, and shall be cancelled in exchange for, the right to receive an amount
in cash equal to the Per Company Common Share Merger Consideration, without
interest (the " _Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration_ "); _provided_
that, in lieu of receiving the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration, if
but only if (x) the holder of such Partnership Common Unit has effectively
made and not revoked a valid election pursuant to Section 2.4(b) to receive
New Partnership Preferred Units in respect thereof, and (y) the issuance of
such New Partnership Preferred Units would be exempt from registration under
the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, then each of such
holders Partnership Common Units shall be converted into one fully paid New
Partnership Preferred Unit, without interest. The aggregate amount of cash
payable as the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration and such
New Partnership Preferred Units are hereinafter referred to as the "
_Partnership Merger Consideration_ " and, together with the Company Common
Share Merger Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_."

 

(b) Subject to Section 2.4(b)(iv) and in accordance with Section 2.4(a),
each eligible holder of Partnership Common Units shall be entitled, with
respect to all, but not less than all, of such holders Partnership Common
Units, to make an unconditional election, on or prior to the Election Date, to
receive in the Partnership Merger in lieu of the Per Partnership Unit Merger
Consideration to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, New

as promptly as practicable following the date the Proxy Statement is mailed

 



7  to the stockholders of the Company and, in any event, not later than five
(5) Business Days after the date on which the Proxy Statement is mailed to the
stockholders of the Company, and the Partnership shall mail to the holders of
Partnership Common Units, a form of election, which form shall be subject to
the reasonable approval of the Company (the " _Form of Election_ "). The Form
of Election may be used by each holder of Partnership Common Units to
designate such holders election to convert all, but not less than all, of the
Partnership Common Units held by such holder into New Partnership Preferred
Units. Any such holders election to receive New Partnership Preferred Units
shall be deemed to have been properly made only if Parent shall have received
at its principal executive office, not later than 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, on the date that is five (5) Business Days before the scheduled date of
the Company Stockholders Meeting (the " _Election Date_ "), a Form of

Election shall automatically be revoked if the Partnership Merger has been
abandoned.

 

(iii) The reasonable determination of Parent shall be binding as
to whether or not elections to receive New Partnership Preferred Units have
been properly made or revoked. If Parent determines that any election to
receive New Partnership Preferred Units was not properly made, Parent shall
notify such holder of Partnership Common Units of the improper election and
provide a reasonable opportunity to such holder to cure the improper election.
If, following such reasonable period, the improperly made election remains
uncured, the Partnership Common Units with respect to which such election was
not properly made shall be converted into Per Partnership Unit Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.4(a). Parent may, with the
agreement of the Company, make such rules as are consistent with this Section
2.4(b) for the implementation of elections provided for herein as shall be
necessary or desirable to fully effect such elections.

 

(iv) Each holder of Partnership Common Units, as a condition to making
a Unit Election with respect to such holders Partnership Common Units, shall
(x) represent to Parent that such holder is an Accredited Investor (as such
term is defined under Rule 501 promulgated under the Securities Act) and (y)
agree to be bound by the terms of the limited partnership agreement of the
Surviving Partnership as it will be in effect immediately following the
Partnership Merger Effective Time (which agreement shall incorporate the terms
of the New Partnership Preferred Units set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto and
any other terms determined by Parent that are not inconsistent with the terms
of the New Partnership Preferred Units).

 

(v) The Company and its Subsidiaries agree to reasonably cooperate
with Parent in preparing any disclosure statement or other disclosure

 



8  information to accompany the Form of Election, including information
applicable to an offering of securities exempt from registration under the
Securities Act pursuant to Rule 506 thereunder, each of which shall be
subject to the reasonable approval of the Company.

 

(vi) Promptly after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the
Surviving Partnership shall deliver to each holder of Partnership Common
Units entitled to receive New Partnership Preferred Units pursuant to the
terms of Sections 2.4(a) and 2.4(b), a notice confirming such holders record
ownership of the New Partnership Preferred Units issuable pursuant hereto in
respect of such Partnership Common Units.

 

(vii) Each Person that receives New Partnership Preferred Units
pursuant to the terms of Section 2.4(a) and Section 2.4(b) shall
automatically be admitted as a limited partner of the Surviving Partnership at
the Partnership Merger Effective Time.

 

(c) At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the
Partnership Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
partnership interest of the Partnership, (i) each Partnership Common Unit held
by the Surviving Company immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective
Time shall be unaffected by the Partnership Merger and shall remain
outstanding as Partnership Common Units of the Surviving Partnership held by
the Surviving Company and (ii) the Roll-Over Limited Partners shall own the
number of New Partnership Preferred Units issued to them in the Partnership
Merger.

(d) At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the
Partnership Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof,
each Partnership Preferred Unit outstanding immediately prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time shall be unaffected by the Partnership
Merger and shall remain outstanding as Partnership Preferred Units of the
Surviving Partnership.

 

(e) At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the
Partnership Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof,
the general partner interests of the Partnership outstanding immediately prior
to the Partnership Merger Effective Time and owned by the Surviving Company
shall remain outstanding as general partner interests of the Surviving
Partnership, entitling the Surviving Company to such rights, duties and
obligations as are more fully set forth in the Amended Partnership Agreement.

 

(f) At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the
Partnership Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof,
each partnership interest in the Merger Partnership shall automatically be
cancelled and cease to exist, the holders thereof shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, and no payment shall be made with respect

9 Section 2.5 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company
to act as Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for (i) the payment or
exchange in accordance with this Article II of the Merger Consideration
(other than any New Partnership Preferred Units to be issued in accordance
with Article II pursuant to the Unit Election) and (ii) if Parent wishes the
Paying Agent to so act, in Parents discretion, the exchange of Partnership
Common Units for New Partnership Preferred Units in accordance with this
Article II pursuant to the Unit Election (the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration and any such New Partnership Preferred Units being referred to
herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). On or before the Company Merger Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent the Exchange Fund for the
benefit of the holders of Company Common Shares and Cash-Out Limited Partners,
as applicable, less applicable income and employment withholding taxes due in
connection with the vesting of Restricted Shares, which shall be paid directly
to the Surviving Company. The Paying Agent shall make payments of the Company
Common Share Merger Consideration and the Partnership Merger Consideration
out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement and the Articles of
Merger. The Company shall cooperate with Parent and the Paying Agent to
facilitate an orderly transfer of funds. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose. Any and all interest earned on cash deposited in the
Exchange Fund shall be paid to the Surviving Company.

 

(b) _Share and Unit Transfer Books_. On the Closing Date, the share
transfer books of the Company and the unit transfer books of the Partnership
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of the Company Common Shares or Partnership Common Units. From and
after the Closing Date, the holders of certificates representing ownership of
the Company Common Shares or, if applicable, Partnership Common Units
outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time or
Partnership Merger Effective Time, as applicable, or any book-entry shares or
book-entry units representing Company Common Shares or Partnership Common
Units (each such certificate, book-entry share or book-entry unit, a "
_Certificate_ "), shall cease to have rights with respect to such shares or
units, as applicable, except as otherwise provided for herein. On or after the
Closing Date, any Certificates presented to the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Company or the Partnership in accordance with this Agreement shall be
exchanged for the Per Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Per
Partnership Unit Merger Consideration or New Partnership Preferred Units, as
applicable, with respect to the Company Common Shares or Partnership Common
Units formerly represented thereby.

 

Section 2.6 _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) _Procedure_. As soon as possible after the Closing Date (but in any
event within five (5) Business Days), the Surviving Company shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates
that, immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, represented
outstanding Company Common Shares or that, immediately prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, represented Partnership Common

 



10  Units whose shares or units, as applicable, were converted into the right to
receive or be exchanged for the Per Company Common Share Merger Consideration,
Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration or New Partnership Preferred Units,
as applicable, pursuant to Sections 2.1 and 2.4: (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass to the Paying Agent, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Per Company Common Share Merger
Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration or New Partnership
Preferred Units, as applicable, to which the holder thereof is entitled. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such
other agent or agents reasonably satisfactory to the Company as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed
and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Per
Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger
Consideration or New Partnership Preferred Units, as applicable, payable in
respect of the Company Common Shares or Partnership Common Units, as
applicable, previously represented by such Certificate pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Shares or Partnership Common Units to a Person that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company or Partnership, payment may be made to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.6, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Closing Date to represent
only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Per Company Common Share
Merger Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration or New
Partnership Preferred Units, as applicable, as contemplated by this Section
2.6. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of
any Certificate.

 

(b) _No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Common Shares or
Partnership Common Units_. On the Closing Date, holders of Company Common
Shares or Partnership Common Units (that are converted into the right to
receive Per Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Per Partnership Unit
Merger Consideration or New Partnership Preferred Units) shall cease to be,
and shall have no rights as, stockholders of the Company or limited partners
of the Partnership other than the right to receive the Per Company Common
Share Merger Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration or New
Partnership Preferred Units, as applicable, provided under this Article II.
The Per Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger
Consideration or New Partnership Preferred Units, as applicable, paid
or delivered upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates representing
Company Common Shares or Partnership Common Units, in accordance with the
terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid or delivered, as
the case may be, in 

 



11  full satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to the Company
Common Shares or Partnership Common Units, exchanged therefor.

 

(c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for twelve
(12) months after the Closing Date, shall be delivered to the Surviving
Company and any holders of Company Common Shares or Partnership Common Units
prior to the Company Merger or Partnership Merger, as applicable, who have
not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Company and only as general creditors thereof for payment of the
Per Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger
Consideration or New Partnership Preferred Units, as applicable.

 

(d) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company,
the Partnership, Merger Partnership, the Surviving Partnership, the Company
or the Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, trustee, director, agent or
Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of Merger
Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of the Certificates immediately prior to the
time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become the property
of, any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of any claims or
interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or
personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

(e) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. After the Closing Date, the Paying
Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the
Surviving Company, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Company. Until the
termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 2.6(c), to the extent
that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments
of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, the Surviving Company
shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost
through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is,
at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent (or,
if subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to Section
2.6(c), the Surviving Company) will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Per Company Common Share Merger Consideration,
Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration or New Partnership Preferred Units,
as applicable, payable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 2.7 _Withholding Rights_. The Company, the Surviving Company,
the Surviving Partnership or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold

 



12  from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment (and, with respect to the Restricted Shares, the
vesting of such Restricted Shares) under the Code (as defined herein), and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local
or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Company, the Surviving Company, the Surviving Partnership or the Paying Agent,
as applicable, and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Company, the Surviving Company, the Surviving Partnership or
the Paying Agent, as applicable.

 

Section 2.8 _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights
shall be available with respect to the Mergers.

Section 2.9 _Adjustment of Company Common Share Merger Consideration,
Partnership Merger Consideration or New Partnership Preferred Units_. In the
event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time or Partnership Merger Effective Time, as applicable,
the Company Common Shares or Partnership Common Units issued and outstanding
shall, through a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock
dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in
the capitalization of the Company or Partnership, as applicable, increase or
decrease in number or be changed into or exchanged for a different kind or
number of securities, then an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall
be made to the Company Common Share Merger Consideration and the Partnership
Merger Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing set forth in this
Section 2.9 shall be construed to supersede or in any way limit the
prohibitions set forth in Section 5.1 hereof.

Partnership are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
Partnership Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Partnership
and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by each of
Parent, Merger Sub, and Merger Partnership, constitutes a valid, legal and
binding agreement of the Partnership, enforceable against the Partnership in
accordance with and subject to its terms and conditions, except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar Laws of general

obligation to contribute) to a multiemployer plan, as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "). Neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has incurred any present or contingent liability under Title IV of
ERISA, nor does any condition exist which could reasonably be likely to

Plan, of which there are none) have been made available to Parent by the
Company: (i) plan and related trust documents, and amendments thereto; (ii)

performed by them under all Company Employee Benefit Plans; (ii) the Company
Employee Benefit Plans have been administered in compliance with their terms
and the requirements of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws; (iii) all
contributions and premium payments (including all employer contributions and
employee salary reduction contributions) required to have been made under any

Company Employee Benefit Plan or the exemption of such trust.

 

(g) Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.12(g)_ , none of the Company
Employee Benefit Plans provide for continuing post-employment health, life
insurance coverage or other welfare benefits for any participant or any
beneficiary of a participant, except as may be required under the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, or similar state law.

(h) No stock or other security issued by the Company forms or has formed
a material part of the assets of any tax qualified Company Employee Benefit
Plan.

 

(i) Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.12(i)_ , neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger will (either
alone or in combination with any other event) (i) result in any payment
becoming due, or increase the amount of compensation due, to any current or
former Service Provider; (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under
any Company Employee Benefit Plan or (iii) result in the acceleration of the
time of payment (including the funding of a trust) or vesting of any
compensation or benefits from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
current or former Service Provider. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, except as set forth in Schedule 3.12(i), no amount payable to any
current or former Service Provider (whether in cash or property or as a
result of accelerated vesting) as a result of the execution of this Agreement
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either
alone or in combination with any other event) under any compensation
arrangement would be nondeductible under Section 280G of the Code. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations to gross-up,
indemnify or otherwise reimburse any current or former Service Provider for
any Taxes incurred by such Service Provider, including under Section 409A or
4999 of the Code, or any interest or penalty related thereto.

 

(j) No "leased employee" as that term is defined in Section 414(n) of
the Code, performs services for the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates or
is eligible to participate in any Company Employee Benefit Plan.

 

(k) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering any persons that,

of the Code, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred
any material liability for Taxes other than in the usual, regular and ordinary

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Intellectual Property_

property necessary to carry on the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted. The Company Intellectual Property is
valid, enforceable and has not been cancelled, forfeited, expired
or abandoned. Neither Company nor any Subsidiary has received any written
notice challenging the validity or enforceability of Company Intellectual
Property. Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.21_ , neither the Company nor
its Subsidiaries is a party to any material licenses, contracts or agreements
with respect to use by the Company or its Subsidiaries of any trademarks,
copyrights or patents. To the Companys knowledge, the conduct of the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries does not violate, misappropriate or
infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any Third Party in any
material respect. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not result in the material loss or material impairment of the
right of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof to own or use any of the

obligations thereunder; and (iii) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
have paid, or caused to be paid, all premiums due under all such policies and
are not in default with respect to any obligations under such policies.

definitive Proxy Statement

 



51  shall have been so mailed, promptly circulate amended or supplemental proxy
materials and, if required in connection therewith, resolicit proxies;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such amended or supplemental proxy materials
will be filed with the SEC or mailed by the Company without consultation and
review by Parent or Merger Sub. The Company will promptly notify Parent and
Merger Sub of the receipt of comments from the SEC and of any request from
the SEC for amendments or supplements to the preliminary Proxy Statement or
definitive Proxy Statement or for additional information, and will promptly
supply Parent and Merger Sub with copies of all written
correspondence between the Company or its representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
preliminary Proxy Statement, the definitive Proxy Statement, the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent, Merger Sub
and Merger Partnership will cooperate with the Company in connection with the
preparation of the Proxy Statement, including furnishing to the Company any
and all information regarding Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Partnership and
their respective Affiliates as may be required to be disclosed therein. The
Proxy Statement shall contain the Company Recommendation (as defined below),
except to the extent that the Company Board shall have effected a Change in
Recommendation, as permitted by and determined in accordance with Section
6.4(c).

 

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries agree that none of the information
to be contained in the Proxy Statement or any other documents to be filed
with the SEC in connection herewith (the " _Other SEC Filings_ ") (including
by incorporation by reference), and Parent and its Subsidiaries agree that
none of the information to be supplied by them to the Company explicitly for
inclusion therein or any Other SEC Filing shall, (i) when filed with the SEC
or other regulatory agency, (ii) when it (or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto) is mailed to the stockholders of the Company and (iii) at
the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If at any time prior
to the Company Stockholders Meeting any event or circumstance relating to the
Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or their
respective officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, which, pursuant to Exchange Act, should be set
forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company
or Parent, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the other party hereto,
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the Companys stockholders. All documents that the Company is
responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Mergers will comply
as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

Section 6.2 _Company Stockholders  Meeting_. The Company shall, as
soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the holders of the Company Common
Stock (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_") for the purpose of seeking
the Company Requisite Vote. The Company shall, through the Company Board, (i)
recommend to holders of the Company Common Stock that they give the

 



52  Company Requisite Vote (the " _Company Recommendation_ ") and (ii) use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit the Company Requisite Vote (including by
soliciting proxies from the Companys stockholders), except to the extent
that the Company Board shall have effected a Change in Recommendation, as
permitted by and determined in accordance with Section 6.4(c). The Company
shall keep Parent updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as
reasonably requested by Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting (A) after consultation with Parent, to the extent
necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement is provided to the holders of Company Common Stock sufficiently in
advance of a vote on this Agreement and the Company Merger to ensure
that such vote occurs on the basis of full and complete information as
required under applicable Law or (B) after consultation with Parent, if
additional time is reasonably required to solicit proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and the Company Merger; _provided_ , that, in the
case of this clause (B), without the consent of Parent, in no event shall the
Company Stockholders Meeting (as so postponed or adjourned) be held on a date
that is more than 30 days after the date for which the Company Stockholders
Meeting was originally scheduled. Unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated in accordance with Article VIII, the obligation of the Company to
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and
mail the Proxy Statement to the Companys stockholders shall not be affected
by a Change in Recommendation.

 

Section 6.3 _Other Filings; Additional Agreements_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub each shall properly prepare and file any other
filings required under the Exchange Act or any other federal, state or foreign
law relating to the Mergers (including filings, if any, required under the HSR
Act) (collectively, the " _Other Filings_ "). Each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall promptly notify the other of the receipt of any comments on,
or any request for amendments or supplements to, any of the Other Filings by
the SEC or any other Governmental Entity or official, and each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall supply the other with copies of all
correspondence between it and each of its representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or the members of its staff or any other appropriate governmental
official, on the other hand, with respect to any of the Other Filings. The
Company, Parent and Merger Sub each shall promptly obtain and furnish the
other (a) the information which may be reasonably required in order to make
such Other Filings and (b) any additional information which may be requested
by a Governmental Entity and which the parties reasonably deem appropriate.

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party
hereto will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws and regulations to
consummate the Mergers and to cause to be satisfied all conditions precedent
to its obligations under this Agreement, in each case as soon as practicable,
after the date hereof, including, consistent with the foregoing, (i) preparing
and filing as promptly as practicable with the objective of being in a
position to consummate the Mergers as promptly as practicable following the
date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, all documentation to

 



53  effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings, and other
documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, waivers,
licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, rulings, authorizations
and clearances necessary to be obtained from any Governmental Entity or Third
Party, including any that are required to be obtained under any federal, state
or local law or regulation or any contract, agreement or instrument to which
the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their respective
properties or assets are bound, each of which is set forth on _Schedule
6.3(b)_ (collectively, the " _Required Consents_ "), (ii) using its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Required Consents, (iii) defending all
lawsuits or other legal proceedings challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Mergers (" _Transaction Litigation_ "), (iv) effecting
all necessary registrations and Other Filings and submissions of information
requested by a Governmental Entity, and (v) using its reasonable best efforts
to cause to be lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining order or
other order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the
Mergers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
connection with obtaining any Required Consents from any Person (other than
Required Consents from a Governmental Entity) (such Required Consent, a "
_Third Party Consent_ ") (i) without the prior written consent of Parent, none
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to pay to such
Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other
consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation
and (ii) none of Parent or any of its Affiliates shall be required to pay or
commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any
cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or
other obligations. In the event that the Company fails to obtain any Third
Party Consent, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and
shall take such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent, to minimize any
adverse effect upon the Company and Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Partnership
and their respective businesses resulting, or which would reasonably be
expected to result, after the Company Merger Effective Time, from the failure
to obtain such Third Party Consent.

 

(c) Each party shall keep the other parties reasonably informed regarding
any Transaction Litigation unless doing so would, in the reasonable judgment
of such party, jeopardize any privilege of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect thereto. The Company shall promptly advise Parent
orally and in writing of the initiation of and any material developments
regarding, and shall reasonably consult with and permit Parent and its
Representatives to participate in the defense, negotiations or settlement of,
any Transaction Litigation, and the Company shall give consideration to
Parents advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation. The Company shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its or their
Representatives to, compromise, settle or come to a settlement arrangement
regarding any Transaction Litigation or consent thereto unless Parent shall
otherwise consent in writing (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

 

(d) Each of the parties hereto shall have the right to review in advance,
and each of the parties hereto will consult the others on, all the
information relating to the other parties hereto that appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any Third Party or Governmental
Entity in connection with the Mergers and the other transactions

 



54  contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and the Company each shall keep the
other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including promptly furnishing
the other with copies of notices or other communications received by Parent or
the Company, as the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any Third
Party or any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent reasonably practicable, none of
the parties hereto shall, nor shall they permit their respective
Representatives to, participate independently in any meeting or engage in any
substantive conversation with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party hereto
prior notice of such meeting or conversation and, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, without giving the other parties hereto the opportunity to
attend or participate (whether by telephone or in person) in any such meeting
with such Governmental Entity.

 

(e) The Company and the Company Board shall (i) take all action necessary
so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to Parent, Merger Sub,
Merger Partnership, this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) if any Takeover Statute becomes
applicable to Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Partnership, this Agreement, the
Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, take all action
necessary so that the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute
on this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(f) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent
and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and do or cause to be done all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE
to cause the delisting of the Company and of the Company Common Stock and
Company Series B Preferred Stock from the NYSE as promptly as practicable
after the Company Merger Effective Time and the deregistration of the Company
Common Stock and Company Series B Preferred Stock under the Exchange Act as
promptly as practicable after such delisting.

Recommendation_.

other advisor or representative (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit or
initiate any inquiries with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or the making

55  nonpublic information to, any Person (including with or to any Person who
the Company has participated in discussions or negotiations with, or provided
nonpublic information to, prior to 11:59 p.m., New York City time on May 9,
2015) relating to any Acquisition Proposal or the making of any proposal or
offer that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, share exchange
agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with Section
6.4(b)) providing for or relating to an Acquisition Proposal (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "). The Company shall (A) promptly, and in
any event within 48 hours after receipt by the Company (or its advisors) of
any Acquisition Proposal, notify Parent orally and in writing of such receipt,
including the material terms and conditions thereof, to the extent known
(including, if applicable, providing copies of any written inquiries,
requests, proposals or offers and any proposed agreements related thereto,
which may be redacted to the extent necessary to protect confidential
information of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal), (B) promptly,
and in any event within 48 hours after receipt of any request for non-public
information relating to it or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to its or
any of its Subsidiaries properties, books or records by any Person that, to
the Companys knowledge, is reasonably likely to make, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal, notify Parent orally and in writing of such receipt, and
(C) notify Parent promptly, and in any event within 48 hours, of any change
to the financial and other material terms and conditions of any Acquisition
Proposal after the making of such change and otherwise keep Parent reasonably
informed of the status of any such Acquisition Proposal, including by

(which may be redacted to the extent necessary to protect confidential
information of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (1) the Company shall
not be required to disclose to Parent or Merger Sub the identity of any Person
making any Acquisition Proposal and (2) the Company and its Representatives
may in any event have discussions with any Person that has made an
unsolicited inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal in order to clarify and
understand the terms and conditions of the inquiry, proposal or offer made by
such Person and to determine whether such inquiry, proposal or offer
constitutes an Acquisition Proposal. None of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any
confidentiality or similar agreement that would prohibit it from providing
such information to Parent.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section
6.4(a), but subject to the Companys compliance with the provisions of this
Section 6.4, at any time prior to the time the Company Requisite Vote is
obtained, if the Company receives a written unsolicited bona fide Acquisition
Proposal after the date of this Agreement from any Person that did not result
from a breach of Section 6.4(a), then (i) the Company may provide nonpublic
information in response to a request therefor by such Person if such Person
has executed and delivered to the Company a confidentiality agreement on
customary terms (such confidentiality agreement, an " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ ") ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the Company
enters into a confidentiality agreement with such Person on terms more

 



56  favorable to such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement is to Blackstone
Real Estate Advisors L.P., then the Company shall offer to amend the
Confidentiality Agreement to extend such more favorable terms to Blackstone
Real Estate Advisors L.P.) and if the Company also promptly (and in any event
within 48 hours after the time such information is provided to such Person)
makes such information available to Parent, if such information has not
previously been provided to Parent; and (ii) the Company may participate in
discussions or negotiations with such Person and its Representatives regarding
such Acquisition Proposal, if prior to taking any of the actions described
in clause (i) or (ii) above, the Company Board determines in good faith, (A)
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law,
and (B) after consulting with its outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal
or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal. This Section
6.4(b) shall not be applicable to the provision of nonpublic information or
the participation in discussions or negotiations prior to 11:59 p.m., New York
City time on May 9, 2015 (but will be applicable after such time, including
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal made prior to such time), except
that the Company shall not provide nonpublic information to any Person
relating to an Acquisition Proposal or the making of any proposal or offer
that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal unless such Person has executed and delivered to the Company an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Company enters into a confidentiality agreement with such Person on terms
more favorable to such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement is to
Blackstone Real Estate Advisors L.P., then the Company shall offer to amend
the Confidentiality Agreement to extend such more favorable terms to
Blackstone Real Estate Advisors L.P.) and the Company also promptly (and in
any event within 48 hours after the time such information is provided to such
Person) makes such information available to Parent, if such information has
not previously been provided to Parent. 

(c) Except as permitted by this Section 6.4(c), the Company Board will
not (i) withhold, withdraw or modify, or propose to withhold, withdraw or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, its Company
Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend,
any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to include the Company Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement or (iv) fail to publicly recommend against any Acquisition
Proposal (including, for these purposes, by taking no position with respect to
the acceptance of such Acquisition Proposal by the Companys stockholders,
which shall constitute a failure to recommend against such Acquisition
Proposal), or to publicly re-affirm the Company Recommendation, in each case,
within ten (10) Business Days following an Acquisition Proposal that has been
publicly announced (or such fewer number of days as remains prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting, as it may be adjourned or postponed in
accordance with this Agreement) (any of the actions described in clauses (i),
(ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 6.4(c), a " _Change in Recommendation_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Requisite Vote, nothing contained in this Agreement (other than the
provisions contained in this Section 6.4(c)) shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from (A)(i) terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(e) or (ii) effecting a Change in Recommendation if prior to taking any
such action (x) the Company has received an unsolicited

 



57  bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited in breach of
this Section 6.4 and that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor,
constitutes a Superior Proposal and (y) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law or (B)
effecting a Change in Recommendation other than in response to an Acquisition
Proposal, if prior to taking such action the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law. The Company and
the Company Board shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1(e) or effect a Change in Recommendation pursuant to
this Section 6.4(c) unless (1) promptly, and in any event at least three (3)
Business Days prior to taking any such action, the Company shall have notified
Parent orally and in writing of its intention to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or effect a Change in Recommendation pursuant to
this Section 6.4(c) (a " _Notice of Change in Recommendation_ "), which notice
shall specify in reasonable detail the reasons therefor and, in the case
of clause (A) in the proviso of the immediately preceding sentence,
describing the material terms and conditions of, and attaching a complete copy
of, the Superior Proposal that is the basis of such action (it being
understood that such material terms shall include the identity of the Third
Party), (2) during the three (3) Business Day period, the Company shall
negotiate, and shall cause its Representatives to negotiate, with Parent in
good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement to obviate the need
to make such Change in Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(e) and (3) following the end of the aforesaid three (3) Business
Day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, taking into
account any changes to this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to
the Notice of Change in Recommendation or otherwise, that (a) in the case of
clause (A) in the proviso of the immediately preceding sentence, the
Acquisition Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Change in Recommendation
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal even if such changes proposed by
Parent were to be given effect and (b) in the case of clause (B) of the
proviso of the immediately preceding sentence, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its duties under applicable Law; provided that any amendment to the
financial or any other material terms of such Acquisition Proposal shall
require a new Notice of Change in Recommendation and the Company shall be
required to comply again with the requirements of this Section 6.4(c) (except
that in the case of such an amendment, the references to three (3) Business
Days in this Section 6.4(c) shall instead be two (2) Business Days).

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or
from making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders which, in the
good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, the failure to make would be inconsistent with its duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor the
Company Board shall be permitted to recommend that the stockholders of the
Company tender

 



58  any securities in connection with any tender offer or exchange offer that is
an Acquisition Proposal (or otherwise approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend (publicly or otherwise) such Acquisition Proposal) or
effect a Change in Recommendation with respect thereto, except as permitted by
Section 6.4(c).

 

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries respective
officers, directors and other Representatives to, (i) at 11:59 p.m., New York
City time on May 9, 2015, immediately cease and terminate any existing
discussions, negotiations or communications with any Person conducted that
may be ongoing with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and (ii) upon
execution of this Agreement, take such action as is necessary to enforce any
confidentiality provisions or provisions of similar effect to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or of which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a beneficiary.

 

Section 6.5 _Resignations_. Upon the written request of Parent, (a)
the Company shall cause any or all of the directors (or persons occupying
similar positions in any limited liability company or other entity) and/or
officers of each direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company to
resign or be removed or, as to officers, to resign or be terminated,
effective as of the Closing, and (b) if the Company or any of its affiliated
entities has the right to appoint any director (or person occupying a similar
position in any limited liability company or other entity), or to cause the
resignation or termination of any officer of any other entity in which the
Company (directly or indirectly) owns an equity interest, the Company shall
cause, effective as of the Closing, such director to resign or to be removed
and/or such officer to resign or be terminated.

Section 6.6 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making
any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Mergers and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without
the prior consent of the other party; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party
may, without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or
make such public statement as may be required by applicable Law or the
applicable rules of any stock exchange or quotation system if the party
issuing such press release or making such public statement has provided the
other party with an opportunity to review and comment (and the parties
shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of any such press release or
public statement) upon any such press release or public statement.

 

Section 6.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.

 

(a) Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Partnership each agree that all rights
to indemnification existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal
liability of, each present or former officer or director of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary and any person who becomes an officer or director of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary after the date hereof but prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time (each an " _Indemnified Party_ " and,
collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") provided for in the respective
charters or bylaws (or other applicable organizational documents) or existing
indemnification agreements listed on

 



59   _Schedule 6.7(a)_ of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries, in
each case, in effect as of the date hereof and covering actions or omissions
by any such Person in its capacity as an officer or director of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries occurring at or prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time, shall survive the Mergers and continue in full force and
effect and, from and after the Company Merger Effective Time, such
indemnification shall become the obligation of the Surviving Company, and from
and after the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, expenses, Judgments and fines arising in whole or in part
out of actions or omissions by such Indemnified Party in its capacity as an
officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries occurring at or
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time (including in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), and shall reimburse each
Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses incurred by
such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, Judgments and fines as
such expenses are incurred (and advance legal or other expenses incurred by
any Indemnified Party in connection with matters for which such Indemnified
Party is eligible to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 6.7(a) within ten
(10) days after receipt by the Surviving Company of a written request for such
advance); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any claims asserted or made within such period shall continue until
the final disposition of such claim; _provided_ , _further_ , that (i) the
Surviving Company shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); (ii)
except for counsel engaged for one or more Indemnified Parties on the date
hereof, the Surviving Company shall not be obligated under this Section
6.7(a) to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a
plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties
in any jurisdiction with respect to any single legal action except to the
extent that two or more of such Indemnified Parties shall have conflicting
interests in the outcome of such action; and (iii) the Surviving Company shall
have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party unless the
Surviving Company receives an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified
Party to repay such legal or other expenses if it is ultimately determined
under applicable Law that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this Section 6.7(a), upon learning of any claim, action or proceeding, shall
notify the Surviving Company thereof in writing; _provided_ , that the failure
to so notify the Surviving Company shall not affect the indemnification
obligations of the Surviving Company under this Section 6.7(a), except to the
extent such failure to notify materially prejudices the Surviving Company.

 

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to maintain the Companys
officers and directors liability insurance policies (accurate and complete
copies of which have been previously provided to Parent) in effect on the date
hereof (the " _D andO Insurance_") for a period of not less than six (6)
years after the Closing Date; _provided_ that the Surviving Company may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms no less advantageous to such former directors or officers so
long as such substitution does not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with
respect to matters occurring on or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time;
_provided_ _further_ that in no event shall Parent or

 



60  the Surviving Company be required to pay annual premiums in the aggregate of
more than an amount equal to 300% of the current annual premiums paid by the
Company for such insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), to maintain or procure
insurance coverage pursuant hereto; _provided_ _further_ that if the amount of
the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage
exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent and the Surviving Company shall procure
and maintain for such six-year period as much coverage as can be reasonably
obtained for the Maximum Amount. Parent shall have the option to cause
coverage to be extended under the Companys DandO Insurance by obtaining a six-
year "tail" policy or policies on terms and conditions no less advantageous
than the Companys existing DandO Insurance, subject to the limitations set
forth in the provisos above in this Section 6.7(b), and such "tail" policy or
policies shall satisfy the provisions of this Section 6.7(b).

 

(c) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this
Section 6.7 shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the Mergers and
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.7 applies (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 6.7 applies shall be
third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.7, each of whom may enforce the
provisions of this Section 6.7). In the event that the Surviving Company or
any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving company or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
its properties and assets to any Person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving
Company, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to
be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Company assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

 

Section 6.8 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) All employees of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries who are
employed immediately prior to the Closing Date and who continue employment
with Parent or its Subsidiaries following the Closing (" _Company Employees_
") shall, solely during any period of employment following the Closing Date
with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, at the option of Parent, either
continue to be eligible to participate in an "employee benefit plan", as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA (an " _Employee Benefit Plan_ "), of the
Company which is, at the option of Parent, continued by Parent or an
Affiliate thereof, or alternatively shall be eligible to participate in the
same manner as other similarly situated employees of Parent or its Affiliates
in a similar Employee Benefit Plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or an
Affiliate thereof or in which employees of Parent or its Affiliates
participate after the Closing Date. With respect to each benefit plan,
program, practice, policy or arrangement maintained by Parent or its
Affiliates following the Closing and in which any of the Company Employees
participate (the " _Parent Plans_ "), and except to the extent necessary to
avoid duplication of benefits, service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and the predecessor of any of them shall be included for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting (if applicable)
and entitlement to benefits (but not for accrual of or entitlement to pension
benefits, post-employment welfare benefits, special or early retirement
programs, window separation programs, or similar plans which may be in effect
from time to time). Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, as the

 



61  case may be, to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to all Company Employees and their dependents under
any Parent Plan that is a welfare plan that such Company Employees may be
eligible to participate in after the Closing Date, other than limitations or
waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and
that have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date under any welfare plan
maintained by the Company for such employees immediately prior to the Closing
Date and (ii) provide each such Company Employee and his or her dependents
with full credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing
Date for the plan year within which the Company Merger Effective Time occurs
in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements, and for
any lifetime maximums, under any welfare plans that such employees are
eligible to participate in after the Closing Date.

 

(b) At and after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to honor in accordance with their terms the employment agreements
listed in _Schedule 6.8(b)_.

 

(c) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Without limiting the generality
of Section 9.6, no provision of this Section 6.8, express or implied, (i) is
intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities
hereunder upon any Person (including, without limitation, any Company Employee
and any dependent or beneficiary thereof) other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns, (ii) shall constitute an amendment
of, or an undertaking to amend, any Company Employee Benefit Plan or any
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by Parent or its
Subsidiaries or (iii) is intended to prevent Parent or its Subsidiaries from
amending or terminating any Company Employee Benefit Plan in accordance with
its terms.

 

Section 6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company,
if (i) any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that is
qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect becomes untrue or
inaccurate in any respect or any such representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement that is not so qualified becomes untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect, or (ii) any failure of the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, materially to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section shall not
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties hereto or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto
under this Agreement and shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

 

Section 6.10 _Restrictions on Dividends_. During the Interim Period, the
Company may make distributions reasonably required for the Company to
maintain its status as a REIT under the Code or to avoid the payment of income
or excise tax under Sections 857 or 4981 of the Code. If the Company declares
a distribution pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Per Company Common
Share Merger Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal to the per
share amount of such distribution; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of
doubt, any distribution

 



62  made in accordance with Section 5.1(c)(ii) (other than any distribution
pursuant to the preceding sentence) shall not result in any such adjustment.

 

Section 6.11 _Taxes_.

 

(a) _REIT Matters_. The Company shall take all actions, and refrain from
taking all actions, as are necessary to ensure that the Company (i) will
qualify for taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for its
current taxable year and any other taxable year that includes the Closing
Date, and (ii) will not become liable for U.S. federal income Tax under
Section 857(b) or 4981 of the Code. During the Interim Period, the Company
shall accommodate all reasonable requests of Parent with respect to
maintenance of the Companys REIT status for the Companys 2015 taxable year
and, if applicable, 2016 taxable year.

 

(b) _Mitigation of Taxes_. Parent and the Company shall, upon written
request, use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate
or other document from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including with respect to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement).

(c) _Tax Returns_. The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared
and timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns for the Company
and each Subsidiary of the Company required to be filed for all taxable
periods ending prior to the Closing Date, including timely filing of Tax
Returns for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. Parent shall cause all
Tax Returns for the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company required to be
filed for the taxable period ending on the Closing Date to be timely
filed. Any such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
historic Tax accounting practices of the Company (except as may be required
under applicable Tax Law). The Company shall pay all Taxes shown as due on
such Tax Returns. The Company shall provide to Parent copies of such Tax
Returns that are to be filed by the Company for all taxable periods ending
prior to the Closing Date at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the due
date of such Tax Returns (including applicable extensions) and the Company
shall accept any and all reasonable comments of Parent with respect to such
Tax Returns.

 

(d) _FIRPTA Certificate_. On the Closing Date, prior to the Company
Merger, the Company shall deliver to Merger Sub a duly executed certificate
of non-foreign status, dated as of the Closing Date, substantially in the form
of the sample certification set forth in Treasury Regulations Section
1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B).

 

Section 6.12 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. A copy of the Fairness
Opinion shall be delivered to Parent promptly after the date such opinion is
issued, solely for informational purposes.

 

Section 6.13 _REIT Opinion_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the tax opinion described in Section 7.2(c) dated as of the
Closing Date.

 



63 Section 6.14 _Cooperation Regarding Existing Loan Documents_.

each of its and its Subsidiaries lenders under the Existing Loan Documents
(and any other party whose consent is required under the Existing Loan
Documents) (the " _Existing Lenders_ ") a notice prepared by Parent, in form
and substance reasonably approved by the Company, requesting that such
Existing Lender deliver to Parent a written statement or documents (the "
_Assumption Documents_ ") (i) confirming (A) that, other than the Existing

any of its Subsidiaries is currently bound in favor of such Existing Lender

under the Existing Loan Documents; and (ii) consenting to (A) the assumption
of the Existing Indebtedness and the consummation of the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (B) to the
modifications of the Existing Loan Documents that Parent may reasonably
request after the date hereof;  _provided_ that the Company shall be informed
of any material request or modification; _provided_ , _further_ , that, in the
event Parent requests Assumption Documents in accordance with this Section
6.14, (x) the consummation of the Mergers shall not be conditioned on, or
delayed or postponed as a result of the receipt of (or failure to receive)
such Assumption Documents from all or any portion of the Existing Lenders and
(y) the approval and execution of any Assumption Documents are subject to the
prior written approval of Parent. Without limiting the foregoing, in
connection with any indebtedness that Parent intends not to repay or cause the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries not to repay at the Closing, the Company
and each of the Companys Subsidiaries shall reasonably cooperate with Parent
in connection with maintaining such continuing indebtedness. In furtherance of
the foregoing, at the option of Parent, (1) Parent shall have the right to
approach any such lender regarding maintaining the indebtedness ( _provided_

of discussions upon the Companys reasonable request) and make all
determinations and decisions regarding such indebtedness and any payment of
costs or fees relating thereto and (2) the Company shall provide Parent with
reasonable access to any such lender and shall, if required by Parent,
provide reasonable cooperation in connection with such indebtedness, in each
case, in the same manner and with the same conditions as provided in Section
6.15(a).

 

(b) Parent shall pay all fees and expenses payable in connection with the
Assumption Documents, including premiums for any endorsements to or re-date
of the title insurance policy previously issued to the Existing Lenders,
servicing fees, rating agency fees, assignment and assumption fees, attorneys

(a) Subject to applicable Law, prior to the Closing, the Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its

requested in writing by Parent in connection with Parent arranging financing
with respect to the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company or the Company
Properties (collectively, the " _Financing_ "), including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) furnish such financial, statistical and other pertinent

Parent and the Company and effective as of or immediately prior to and

connection with the repayment or defeasance of any existing indebtedness of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Company Merger Effective Time
including delivering such payoff, defeasance or similar notices under any
existing loans of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as reasonably

65  and (C) the Company shall be entitled to have representatives present at all
times during any such inspection); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably
interfere with the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries
or require the Company to agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses, or
give any indemnities prior to the Company Merger Effective Time (except those
that the Company is reimbursed for by Parent). None of the representations,
warranties or covenants of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall be
deemed to apply to, or deemed breached or violated by, any of the actions
taken by the Company at the request of Parent set forth in this Section
6.15(a). Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or
its Subsidiaries in performing their obligations under this Section 6.15(a),
and indemnify the Company for any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising therefrom (and in
the event the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not consummated, Parent shall reimburse the Company for any
reasonable out-of-pocket costs not previously reimbursed).

(b) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the
Company obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to Section 6.15(a)
above shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 

Section 6.16 _Other Transactions_. Parent shall have the option, in its
sole discretion and without requiring the further consent of any of the
Company, the Company Board or any board of trustees, board of directors,
stockholders or partners of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries,
upon reasonable notice to the Company, to request that the Company,
immediately prior to the Closing, (a) convert or cause the conversion of one

shall be required to take any action in contravention of any organizational
document of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries or other
contract, (ii) any such actions or transactions shall be contingent upon all
of the conditions set forth in Article VII having been satisfied (or, with
respect to Section 7.2, waived) and receipt by the Company of a written
notice from Parent to such effect and that Parent and Merger Sub are prepared
to proceed immediately with the Closing and any other evidence reasonably
requested by the Company that the Closing will occur (it being understood
that in any event the transactions described in clauses (a), (b) and (c) will
be deemed to have occurred prior to the Closing), (iii) such actions (or the
inability to complete such actions) shall not affect or modify in any respect
the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement, including
payment of the Merger Consideration, (iv) neither the Company nor any of

 



66  its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any such action that could
adversely affect the classification of the Company as a REIT or could subject
the Company to any "prohibited transactions" taxes or other material Taxes
under Code Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981, or could reasonably be expected to
subject the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any shareholder, member or
partner of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any other material
adverse Tax consequence, and (v) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall
be required to take any such action that could result in any U.S. federal,
state or local income Tax being imposed on the limited partners of the
Partnership in excess of any income Taxes they will incur as a result of the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than
the transactions contemplated by this Section 6.16). Without limiting
the foregoing, none of the representations, warranties or covenants of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed
breached or violated by, any of the transactions contemplated by this Section
6.16 or required by Parent pursuant to this Section 6.16. Parent shall,
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in performing

provide the notice of Fundamental Change (the " _Fundamental Change Notice_ ")
contemplated by Section 8(k)(iv) of the Articles Supplementary relating to the
Company Series A Preferred Stock (the " _Series A Articles Supplementary_ ")

shall relieve any party from any liability for any willful or intentional
breach by a party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, whether or not the
Mergers are consummated, all Expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
party incurring such Expenses, including, in the case of Parent, the payment
of any Assumption Expenses.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant
to Section 8.1(d), (ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or (iii)(A)
by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or Section 8.1(f) or by
Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(h) and (B)(x) an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been received by the Company or its Representatives or any Person shall
have publicly proposed or publicly announced an intention (whether or not
conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal (and, in the case of a
termination pursuant to Section 8.1(f), such Acquisition Proposal or publicly
proposed or announced intention shall not have been publicly withdrawn prior
to the Company Stockholders Meeting) and (y) within twelve (12) months after
a termination referred to in this Section 8.3(b)(iii) the Company enters into
a definitive agreement relating to, or consummates, any Acquisition Proposal
(with, for purposes of this clause (y), the references to "20%" in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" being deemed to be references to "50%"),
then the Company shall pay as directed by Parent an amount equal to the
Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) (the " _Company Termination Fee_ ")
by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent, (1) in
the case of a payment as a result of any event referred to in Section
8.3(b)(iii), within two (2) Business Days after the earlier of entering into a
definitive agreement relating to the Acquisition Proposal referred to in
clause (y) and consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, and (2) and in the

termination.

 



73 (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 8.1(g) or Section 8.1(i), then Parent shall pay or cause
to be paid to the Company an amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee by
wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by the Company

_Parent Termination Fee_ " shall be an amount equal to Two Hundred Fifty
Million Dollars ($250,000,000).

 

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated, to the extent that
the Company or Parent does not make a timely payment of amounts required by
Section 8.3(b) or Section 8.3(c), respectively, then interest on such amounts
shall accrue at a rate of five percent (5%) per annum, compounding quarterly,
until paid in full.

(e) The Company and Parent agree that the agreements contained
in Section 8.3(b), (c) and (d) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, that the damages resulting from the failure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated in the
circumstances in which the payments under Section 8.3(b), (c) and (d) are
payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and that the
amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.3 are a reasonable forecast of the
actual damages which may be incurred and that the payments to be made
thereunder shall constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and that
without these agreements, the parties hereto would not have entered into this
Agreement. Without limiting Section 9.8(a), the parties further agree that
termination of this Agreement and abandonment of the Mergers contemplated
herein, with the consequences specifically provided for in this Section 8.3 in
the case of such termination, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for
damages for any breach of the Companys or Parents (as the case may be)
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, and that the Company, Parent nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, controlling stockholders, agents or other
representatives shall have any liability for damages arising out of, resulting
from or relating to any such breach. In the event that Parent or the Company,
as the case may be, is required to commence litigation to seek all or a
portion of the amounts payable under this Section 8.3, and it prevails in such
litigation, it shall be entitled to receive, in addition to all amounts that
it is otherwise entitled to receive under this Section 8.3, all reasonable
expenses (including attorneys fees) which it has incurred in enforcing its
rights hereunder.

 

Section 8.4 _Payment of Amount or Expense_.

 

(a) In the event that Parent is obligated to pay the Company the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(c) (the " _Section 8.3 Amount_ "),
Parent (" _Payor_ ") shall pay to the Company (" _Payee_ ") from the
applicable Section 8.3 Amount deposited into escrow, if any, in accordance
with the next sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the Section 8.3
Amount and (B) the sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be paid to the
Company without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such
amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(H) or
856(c)(3)(H) or (I) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), as determined
by the Companys independent certified public accountants, plus (2) in the
event the Company

 



74  receives either (X) a letter from the Companys counsel indicating that the
Company has received a ruling from the IRS described in Section 8.4(b)(ii) or
(Y) an opinion from the Companys outside counsel as described in Section
8.4(b)(ii), an amount equal to the Section 8.3 Amount less the amount payable
under clause (1) above. To secure the Payors obligation to pay these amounts,
the Payor shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Section
8.3 Amount with an escrow agent selected by the Payor and on such terms
(subject to Section 8.4(b)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company,
Parent and the escrow agent, provided that the payment or deposit into escrow
shall be at the Payees option. The payment or deposit into escrow of the
Section 8.3 Amount pursuant to this Section 8.4(a) shall be made at the time
the Payor is obligated to pay the Payee such amount pursuant to Section
8.3(c) by wire transfer or bank check.

 

(b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Section 8.3 Amount in
escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to any Payee that is a
REIT unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following:
(i) a letter from the Payees independent certified public accountants
indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the
Payee without causing the Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code in such year determined as if the payment of
such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from
the Payees accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent
shall release such amount to the Payee, or (ii) a letter from the Payees
counsel indicating that the Payee received a ruling from the IRS holding that
the receipt by the Payee of the Section 8.3 Amount would either constitute
Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or alternatively, the Payees outside
counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the
Payee of the Section 8.3 Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or
would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code), in which case the escrow agent shall release the
remainder of the Section 8.3 Amount to the Payee. The Payor agrees to amend
this Section 8.4 at the reasonable request of any Payee that is a REIT in
order to (x) maximize the portion of the Section 8.3 Amount that may be
distributed to the Payee hereunder without causing the Payee to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve the
Payees chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this Section
8.4(b) or (z) assist the Payee in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its
outside counsel as described in this Section 8.4(b). Any portion of Section
8.3 Amount that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid
as soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the
foregoing limitations of this Section 8.3. The escrow agreement shall also
provide that any portion of the Section 8.3 Amount held in escrow for five
years shall be released by the escrow agent to the Payor. The Payor shall not
be a party to such escrow agreement and shall not bear any cost of or have
liability resulting from the escrow agreement. The Payor shall be deemed to
have satisfied its obligations pursuant to this Section 8.4 so long as it
deposits into escrow the Section 8.3 Amount, notwithstanding any delay or
reduction in payment to any Payee that is a REIT, and shall have no further
liability with respect to payment of the Section 8.3 Amount.

Section 9.5 _Descriptive Headings_. The descriptive headings herein are
inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of
or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.6 _Parties In Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and its successors and
permitted assigns, and, except as

 



78  provided in Section 6.7, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. The
parties hereto further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries
under Section 6.7 shall not arise unless and until the Company Merger
Effective Time occurs.

 

Section 9.7 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions
hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) if necessary, a
suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to
carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of
such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity
or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other
jurisdiction.

 

Section 9.8 _Remedies_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the
Company or the Partnership in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that Parent, Merger Sub and
Merger Partnership shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company and the Partnership and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to, and without any limitation of, any other remedy to which Parent,
Merger Sub or Merger Partnership are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
Company and the Partnership further agrees not to assert that a remedy of
specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable
for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide
an adequate remedy. Each of the Company and the Partnership hereby waives (i)
any defenses in any action for specific performance, including the defense
that a remedy at Law would be adequate, and (ii) any requirement under any
Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable
relief. The parties hereto agree that neither the Company nor the Partnership
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Partnership or to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and that the Companys
and the Partnerships sole and exclusive remedy relating to a breach of this
Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Partnership or otherwise shall be
the remedy set forth in Section 8.3(c); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to prevent any breach
by Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Partnership of Section 5.2(c).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
maximum aggregate liability of Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Partnership
together for any losses, damages, costs or expenses of the Company or the
Partnership relating to the failure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated, or a breach of this

 



79  Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Partnership or otherwise, shall be
limited to an amount equal to (i) the amount of the Parent Termination Fee,
_plus_ (ii) the aggregate amount of Assumption Expenses payable pursuant to
Section 6.14(b), _plus_ (iii) Parents indemnification and reimbursement
obligations pursuant to the last sentence of Section 6.15(a), the last
sentence of Section 6.16 and the last sentence of Section 8.3(e)
(collectively, the " _Liability Limitation_ "), and in no event shall the
Company or any of its Affiliates seek any amount in excess of the Liability
Limitation in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith or therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract, tort or
otherwise. Each of the Company and the Partnership agrees that it has no right
of recovery against, and no personal liability shall attach to, any of the
Parent Parties (other than Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Partnership to
the extent provided in this Agreement), through Parent, Merger Sub or Merger
Partnership or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or
through a claim by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Partnership
against any Parent Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal
or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any applicable Law, whether in contract,
tort or otherwise, except for its rights to recover from the Guarantor (but
not any other Parent Party) under and to the extent provided in the Guaranty
and subject to the Liability Limitation and the other limitations described
therein. Recourse against the Guarantor under the Guaranty shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Company, the Partnership and their respective
Affiliates against the Guarantor and any other Parent Party (other than
Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Partnership to the extent provided in this
Agreement) in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith or therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise. Without limiting the rights of the Company against Parent, Merger
Sub or Merger Partnership hereunder, in no event shall the Company or its
Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach
of this Agreement against, or seek to recover damages from, any Parent Party
(other than the Guarantor to the extent provided in the Guaranty and subject
to the Liability Limitation and the other limitations described therein).

Section 9.9 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by action taken
by the Company, the Partnership, Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Partnership at
any time before or after approval of the Mergers by the Company Requisite Vote
but, after such approval, no amendment shall be made which requires the
approval of any such stockholders under applicable Law without such
approvals. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of the parties hereto.

 

Section 9.10 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing Date,
each party hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in
any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto, or (iii)
subject to Section 9.9, waive compliance by the other party with any of the
agreements or

 



80  conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of either party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of either
party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights.

 

Section 9.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

 

Section 9.12 _Interpretation_.

 

(a) The words "hereof," "herein" and "herewith" and words of similar
import shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and article,
section, paragraph, exhibit and schedule references are to the articles,
sections, paragraphs, exhibits and schedules of this Agreement unless
otherwise specified. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "without limitation." All terms defined in this Agreement shall have
the defined meanings contained herein when used in any certificate or other
document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein.
Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any
agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or statute as from time to time, amended, qualified or
supplemented, including (in the case of agreements and instruments) by waiver
or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor
statutes and all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.
References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.

(b) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring
or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of
this Agreement.
