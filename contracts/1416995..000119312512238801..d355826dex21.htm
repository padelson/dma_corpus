and is among HICKS ACQUISITION COMPANY II, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Buyer"), PAPERWEIGHT DEVELOPMENT CORP., a Wisconsin corporation ("PDC"),

defined) with PDC and (iii) in accordance with the Company LLC Agreement,
issue to PDC the sum of (i) 9,632,024 Class B units of the Company with such

Units equal to the number of Cross Purchase Class B Units.

C. Prior to the Closing, PDC will (i) form a new wholly-owned Delaware
corporation ("Newco") and (ii) contribute to Newco 48,160.12 Company Class B
Exchangeable Units. 

D. At the Closing, Buyer will acquire (the "Acquisition") an aggregate number

aggregate number of shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of
Buyer ("Buyer Common Stock") outstanding immediately after giving effect to
the Redemptions and Repurchases (the "Transaction Class A Units") less the
number of Cross Purchase Class A Units (such net number of Company Class A
Voting Units, the "Acquired Class A Units") in exchange for Buyers payment at
Closing to the Company of an amount in cash equal to the assets in the Trust
Account less the sum of (A) amounts used to purchase shares of Buyer Common

E. One day after the Closing, PDC will sell to Buyer and Buyer will purchase
(the "Cross Purchase") from PDC an aggregate number of Company Class B
Exchangeable Units equal to a percentage of the Transaction Class A Units,
which percentage shall be determined in accordance with the Cross
Purchase Agreement by dividing (i) the fair market value of the consideration
paid by Buyer in the Cross Purchase (the "Cross Purchase Consideration") by
(ii) the sum of the Cross Purchase Consideration and the Closing
Acquisition Consideration (such aggregate Units, the "Cross Purchase Class B
Units"), pursuant to that certain Cross Purchase Agreement, dated as of the
date hereof, by and among Buyer and PDC (the "Cross Purchase Agreement"), for
the consideration set forth in the Cross Purchase Agreement, which Cross
Purchase Class B Units shall immediately be surrendered by Buyer to the
Company for cancellation and, upon its receipt thereof, the Company will
immediately issue to Buyer an identical number of Company Class A Voting
Units (the "Cross Purchase Class A Units") in exchange for such cancelled
Cross Purchase Class B Units.

this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party
and has determined that this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby are advisable and in the
respective best interests of each of Buyer, PDC and the Company and their
respective stockholders and equityholders. ##### Table of Contents

  

_STATEMENT OF AGREEMENT_

 

In consideration of the mutual terms, conditions and other agreements set
forth herein and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:

_ARTICLE I_

 

 _EQUITY PURCHASES_

1.1 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the
transactions herein contemplated shall have been abandoned in accordance with
_Section 9.1_, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in ARTICLE VII, the closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") will take place no later than 9:00 a.m. Central time
on the first Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of each of the
conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII hereof (the "Closing Date") at the offices

writing by the parties hereto.

subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall (a) purchase from the

Units and (b) pay to the Company by wire transfer in immediately available
funds an aggregate amount equal to the Closing Acquisition Consideration.
Simultaneously therewith, Buyer shall execute and deliver an accession
agreement to the Company LLC Agreement in the form attached as Exhibit C to
the Company LLC Agreement. Of the Company Class A Voting Units issued to Buyer
pursuant to this _Section 1.2_, 428,571 shall be designated "Founder Earnout
Company Class A Units" and shall be subject to forfeiture if those certain
428,571 shares of Buyer Common Stock held by the Founder and certain directors
of the Buyer that are subject to forfeiture (such shares, the "Founder
Earnout Buyer Common Stock") are forfeited, which forfeiture shall occur if
the last sales price of the Buyer Common Stock as reported by the national
securities exchange on which the Buyer Common Stock is listed or admitted to
trading does not equal or exceed $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock
splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for
any 20 trading days within any 30 consecutive trading day period at any time
during the period ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date.

1.3 _Cross Purchase_. On the day after the Closing, pursuant to the
Cross Purchase Agreement, PDC shall sell to Buyer and Buyer shall purchase
from PDC the Cross Purchase Class B Units and, in exchange therefor, Buyer
shall (a) enter into that certain Tax Receivable Agreement, in the form
attached to the Cross Purchase Agreement, by and between Buyer and PDC (the
"Tax Receivable Agreement"), (b) issue to PDC 481,601.2 shares of Series A
voting preferred stock of Buyer, par value $0.0001 per share, with such terms
and conditions as set forth in the Certificate of Designation (such series,
the "Buyer Series A Voting Preferred Stock") and (c) issue to PDC, to the
extent it becomes due and payable in accordance with the Cross Purchase
Agreement, the Contingency Consideration (as defined in the Cross Purchase
Agreement). Pursuant to this Agreement, immediately upon receipt of the Cross
Purchase Class B Units, Buyer shall surrender such Cross Purchase Class B
Units to the Company for cancellation and, upon receipt thereof, the Company
shall issue to Buyer the Cross Purchase Class  A Units.

section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations thereunder, with respect to any
Title IV Plan set forth in _Schedule 3.16(e)_ (other than an event for which
the 30-day notice period is waived) and neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
will constitute a reportable event.

(h) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has terminated any Title IV
Plan within the last six years or incurred any outstanding liability under
section 4062 of ERISA to the PBGC, or to a trustee appointed under section
4042 of ERISA. All premiums due the PBGC with respect to the Title IV Plans
set forth in _Schedule 3.16(e)_ have been paid. Neither the Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate has filed a notice of intent to terminate any Title IV Plan

With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is a Multiemployer Plan:

 



13 ##### Table of Contents

if, as of the Closing Date, the Company and any ERISA Affiliates were to
withdraw from all Multiemployer Plans to which the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate has contributed or been obligated to contribute, the Company
and the ERISA Affiliates would incur no liabilities to such plans under Title
IV of ERISA. _Schedule 3.16(i)_ sets forth, for each Multiemployer Plan set
forth therein, the estimated amount that would be the Companys or ERISA
Affiliates "withdrawal liability" (within the meaning of Part 1 of Subtitle E
of Title IV of ERISA) if the Company or ERISA Affiliate withdrew from such
Multiemployer Plan on the last day of the plan year preceding the Closing
Date, and an explanation of how such amount was determined, as provided by the
plan sponsor or administrator of such Multiemployer Plan.

ERISA, has engaged in any transaction described in section 4069 or 4212(c) of
ERISA.

(k) Neither the Company (including its ERISA Affiliates) nor any other "party
in interest" or "disqualified person" with respect to any Company Benefit Plan
has engaged in a non exempt "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of
section 406 of ERISA or section 4975 of the Code involving such Company
Benefit Plan that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to subject the Company to a Tax imposed by section 4975 of the Code
or a penalty imposed by section 501, 502 or 510 of ERISA, which, in either
case, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. To the Knowledge of the Company, no fiduciary has any material
liability for breach of fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply
with the requirements of ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Laws in
connection with the administration or investment of the assets of any Company
Benefit Plan.

 

(l) All liabilities or expenses of each of the Company in respect of any
Company Benefit Plan (including workers compensation) that have not been paid

contributions and employee salary reduction contributions) or premium
payments required to have been made under the terms of any Company Benefit
Plan, or in accordance with applicable Law, as of the date hereof have been
timely made or reflected on the Companys Financial Statements in accordance
with GAAP.

(m) The Company has no obligation to provide or make available post employment
benefits under any Company Benefit Plan that is a "welfare plan" (as defined
in section 3(1) of ERISA) for any Business Employee, except as may be required
under Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and at the sole expense of such
individual. There are no reserves, assets, surpluses or prepaid premiums with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is a welfare plan.

(n) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.16(n)_ , neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (either alone or in combination with another event)
(i) result in any payment becoming due, or increase the amount of any
compensation due, to any Business Employee, (ii) increase any benefits
otherwise payable under any Company Benefit Plan, (iii) result in
the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such compensation
or benefits, (iv) result in a non exempt "prohibited transaction" as defined
in section 406 of ERISA or section 4975 of the Code, or (v) result in
the payment of any amount that could (alone or in combination with any other
payment) constitute an "excess parachute" payment as defined in section
280G(b)(1) of the Code. No Business Employee has or will obtain a right to
receive a gross up payment from the Company with respect to any excise tax
that may be imposed upon such individual pursuant to section 409A or 4999 of
the Code or otherwise.

create any additional employee benefit or compensation plans, policies or

vested obligations and medical or welfare claims incurred prior to such

wish to amend and restate the Original Agreement to ##### Table of Contents

  

 reflect the Transfer of Appleton Class B Exchangeable Units from

transaction, the "Cross Purchase") pursuant to the Cross Purchase Agreement
(the "Cross Purchase Agreement"), which such Appleton Class B Exchangeable

Exchange"); and

 _CAPITALIZATION_

3.1 _Units; Initial Capitalization; Schedules_.

(a) _Limited Liability Company Interests_. A Members Membership Interest in
the Company shall be represented by and divided into Units. As of the date
hereof, the Units are comprised of two Classes: "Appleton Class A Voting
Units" and "Appleton Class B Exchangeable Units." All Units shall have
identical rights in all respects as all other Units except as otherwise
specified in this Agreement. Currently the Company is authorized to issue
only Class B Exchangeable Units and Appleton Class A Voting Units, which shall
carry the same economic rights and obligations and shall differ only as to
voting rights as set forth herein. 

(b) _Schedule of Units; Schedule of Members_. The aggregate number of
outstanding Units, the aggregate amount of cash Capital Contributions that
have been made by the Members and the Fair Market Value of any property other
than cash contributed by the Members with respect to the Units (including, if
applicable, a description and the amount of any liability assumed by the
Company or to which contributed property is subject) shall be set forth on a
schedule maintained by the Company. The Company shall also maintain a schedule
setting forth the name and address of each Member, the number of Units owned
by such Member, the Members Percentage Interest, Class A Percentage Interest
and Class B Percentage Interest, the initial balance of each Members Capital
Account as of the date of this Agreement and the aggregate Capital
Contributions that have been made by such Member or transferred to such Member
with respect to such Members Units (such schedule, the "Schedule of
Members"). The Schedule of Members shall be the definitive record of
ownership of each Unit or other Equity Security in the Company and all
relevant information with respect to each Member. The Company shall be
entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a Person registered on its
records as the owner of Units or other Equity Securities in the Company for
all purposes and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim
to or interest in Units or other Equity Securities in the Company on the part
of any other Person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice
thereof, except as otherwise provided by the Act.

 

3.2 _Authorization and Issuance of Additional Units_.

 

(a) _Required Issuances_. As contemplated by, and consistent with, the
Exchange Agreement, at all times the Company shall have issued and
outstanding the same number of Appleton Class A Voting Units as the number of
shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding. In addition, the
Company shall issue such Appleton Class A Voting Units to the Class A Holder
as required pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement, the Cross Purchase
Agreement, Section 3.4(b) and/or the Exchange Agreement, including, without
limitation, the issuance of additional Appleton Class A Voting Units upon the
issuance of Common Stock in connection with the exercise of warrants to
purchase Common Stock and shall otherwise issue Appleton Class A Voting Units
to the Class A Holder to the extent necessary so that at all times the Class
A Holder shall hold a number of Appleton Class A Voting Units in an amount
equal to the shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding (each such
issuance a "Required Class A Issuance" or "Required Issuances").

(b) _Additional Issuances_. Except for the Required Issuances, the
Company shall not issue additional Appleton Class A Voting Units or Appleton
Class B Exchangeable Units and/or establish and issue other Classes of Units,
other Equity Securities in the Company or other Company securities from time
to time with such rights, obligations, powers, designations, preferences and
other terms, which may be equal or different from, including senior to, any
then existing or future Classes of Units, other Equity Securities in the
Company or other Company securities. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Company shall not issue (i) Appleton Class A Voting Units to any
Person other than the Class A Holder or (ii) Appleton Class B Exchangeable
Units to any Person other than pursuant to the Exchange Agreement.

(c) _Subdivisions, Splits, Combinations and Reverse Splits_. The Company
shall not in any manner divide or subdivide (by any Unit split, Unit
distribution, reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization or otherwise)
or combine or consolidate (by reverse Unit split, reclassification,
recapitalization, reorganization

 



14 ##### Table of Contents

  

 or otherwise) the outstanding Units unless an identical event is occurring
with respect to the Common Stock. In the event of any such division or
subdivision or combination or consolidation of the Common Stock, the Units,
_inter alia_ , shall automatically be divided, subdivided, consolidated or
combined concurrently with and in the same manner as the Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of the Exchange Agreement.

 

(d) _Redemptions of Common Stock_. At any time a share of Common Stock is
redeemed, repurchased, acquired, cancelled or terminated by the Class A
Holder, one Appleton Class A Voting Unit registered in the name of the Class A
Holder will hereby automatically be cancelled for no consideration by the
Company so that the number of Appleton Class A Voting Units held by the Class
A Holder at all times equals the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.
The register of the Company shall be adjusted accordingly and on a timely
basis.

 

3.3 _Existing Capital Contributions_. Each Member has made or is deemed to
have made, on or prior to the date hereof, the Capital Contributions and has
acquired the number of Units set forth opposite such Members name on the
Schedule of Members, the receipt of which Capital Contribution is hereby
acknowledged and confirmed as constituting good and valuable consideration
for the Units held by such Member by all the Members of the Company. Upon
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Equity Purchase
Agreement,  Appleton Class A Voting Units are to be issued by the
Company to the Class A Holder in exchange for a cash Capital Contribution by
the Class A Holder to the Company. Through the Cross Purchase,
Appleton Class B Exchangeable Units are to be transferred by PDC to the Class
A Holder in exchange for the transfer of the Cross Purchase Consideration.
The Members and the Company hereby acknowledge that the Schedule of Members
shall reflect that the portion of the historical Capital Account and Capital
Contributions of PDC associated with the Class B Exchangeable Units, as
existing prior to the Cross Purchase, that is attributable to Appleton Class B
Exchangeable Units Transferred from PDC to the Class A Holder pursuant to the
Cross Purchase will be carried over to the Class A Holder. The Members hereby
acknowledge and agree with the capital, tax, this Agreement, and other
treatment of the transactions and other matters set forth in the recitals to
this Agreement and shall prepare all books, records, and filings in a
manner consistent with such treatment.

3.4 _Funding Requirements_.

 

(a) Each Member has contributed to the Company the amounts, in cash or other
assets, as set forth in Section 3.3 and the Schedule of Members, and the
Members and the Company agree that the Company shall fund its ongoing
operations from its cash from operations and its own borrowings or credit and
no Member shall be required to make a Capital Contribution or loan, or
otherwise advance any funds to the Company except with respect to the Class A
Holder as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Equity Purchase Agreement
and/or the Exchange Agreement.

 

(b) In accordance with the Exchange Agreement, the Class A Holder (i) shall
contribute the proceeds of any issuance of shares of Common Stock (other than
shares of Common Stock issued to any Exchanging Member upon an Exchange
pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement) to the Company in exchange
for a number of Appleton Class A Voting Units equal to the number of shares
of Common Stock so issued, and (ii) upon any issuance of any Equity Securities
or other securities other than shares of Common Stock, including convertible
debt securities, preferred stock, options, warrants, or other securities
exercisable for or convertible into Common Stock (other than an issuance to an
Exchanging Member upon an Exchange pursuant to the Exchange Agreement), the
Class A Holder shall immediately contribute, lend or otherwise provide the
proceeds of such issuance to the Company in a transaction which the Managing
Member acting in Good Faith reasonably determines is substantially equivalent
in economic terms to the issuance by Parent, subject to any approvals required
by Section 7.4(b) and Section 7.4(c).

(c) The Class A Holder shall maintain a reserve consisting of all Excess Cash
and shall keep the Company reasonably apprised of the amount of such reserves.
At the request of the Managing Member acting in Good Faith, the Class A Holder
shall provide all or a portion of such reserved funds to the Company in any
of the following transactions requested by the Managing Member: (i) by making
a loan to the Company bearing interest at the Applicable Federal Rate in
effect as of the date of such loan and on such 

 



15 ##### Table of Contents

  

 other terms and conditions reasonably requested by the Managing Member
acting in Good Faith (a "Cash Management Loan"), (ii) by making a Capital
Contribution to the Company, or (iii) by entering into such other transaction
reasonably acceptable to the Class A Holder and the Managing Member. Each Cash
Management Loan shall provide that the Company may, as determined by the
Managing Member acting in Good Faith, prepay any balances owed thereunder in
order to provide the Class A Holder with funds sufficient to satisfy its
obligations with respect to Reimbursable Member Expenses and the Tax
Receivable Agreement.

 

3.5 _Capital Accounts_.

 

(a) _Maintenance of Capital Accounts_. The Company shall maintain for each
Member owning Units a separate Capital Account with respect to such Units in
accordance with the rules of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-l(b)(2)(iv).
The initial balance of such Capital Account shall be set forth on the Schedule
of Members and shall be increased by (i) the amount of all Capital
Contributions made to the Company with respect to such Units pursuant to this
Agreement and (ii) the amount of Net Income allocated with respect to such
Units pursuant to Section 5.1(a) or any items in the nature of income or
gains that are specially allocated pursuant to Section 5.1(b), and decreased
by (x) the amount of cash or Net Agreed Value of all actual and deemed
distributions of cash or property made with respect to such Units pursuant to
this Agreement and (y) the amount of Net Losses allocated with respect to such
Units pursuant to Section 5.1(a) or any items in the nature of expenses or
losses that are specially allocated pursuant to Section 5.1(b). The foregoing
provisions and the other provisions of this Agreement relating to the
maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended to comply with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b) and shall be interpreted and applied in a
manner consistent with such Treasury Regulations.

(b) _Transfers_. A transferee of Units shall succeed to a pro rata portion of
the Capital Account of the transferor relating to the Units so transferred.

(c) _Carrying Value Adjustment_.

(i) In accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1 (b)(2)(iv)(f),
on an issuance of additional Units for cash or Contributed Property and the
issuance of Units as consideration for the provision of services, the Capital
Account of all Members and the Carrying Value of each Company property
immediately prior to such issuance shall be adjusted upward or downward to
reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Company
property, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been recognized on
an actual sale of each such property immediately prior to such issuance and
had been allocated to the Members at such time pursuant to Section 5.1 in the
same manner as a corresponding item of gain or loss actually recognized during
such period would have been allocated. In determining such Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss, the aggregate cash amount and Fair Market Value of all
Company assets (including, without limitation, cash or cash equivalents)
immediately prior to the issuance of additional Units shall be determined by
the Managing Member using such method of valuation as it may adopt acting in
Good Faith; provided, however, that the Managing Member, in arriving at such
valuation, must take fully into account the Fair Market Value of the Units of
all Members at such time. The Managing Member shall allocate such aggregate
value among the assets of the Company (in such manner as it determines) to
arrive at a Fair Market Value for individual properties.

 

(ii) In accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1 (b)(2)(iv)(f),
immediately prior to any actual or deemed distribution to a Member of any
Company property (other than a distribution of cash that is not in redemption
or retirement of a Unit), the Capital Accounts of all Members and the Carrying
Value of all Company property shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect
any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Company property,
as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been recognized in a sale of
such property immediately prior to such distribution for an amount equal to
its fair market value, and had been allocated to the Members, at such time,
pursuant to Section 5.1 in the same manner as a corresponding item of gain or
loss actually

 



16 ##### Table of Contents

  

 recognized during such period would have been allocated. In determining such
Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss, the aggregate cash amount and fair market
value of all Company assets (including, without limitation, cash or cash
equivalents) immediately prior to a distribution shall (A) in the case of an
actual distribution that is not made pursuant to ARTICLE VIII or in the case
of a deemed distribution, be determined and allocated in the same manner as
that provided in Section 3.5(c)(i) or (B) in the case of a liquidating
distribution pursuant to ARTICLE VIII, be determined and allocated by the
Person winding up the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b) using such method of
valuation as it may adopt.

(iii) The Managing Member acting in Good Faith may make the
adjustments described in clause (i) above in the manner set forth therein if
the Managing Member determines acting in Good Faith that such adjustments are
necessary or useful to effectuate the intended economic arrangement among the
Members, including Members who received Units in connection with the
performance of services to or for the benefit of the Company.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Members hereby agree that the Carrying
Value of the Initial Contributed Property as of the date of the Initial
Company Capitalization was as set forth in the Original Agreement and the
Carrying Value of such Initial Contributed Property as of the date hereof is
as set forth in the Equity Purchase Agreement and reflected on the Schedule
of Members as of the date hereof.

3.6 _No Withdrawal_. No Person shall be entitled to withdraw any part of such
Persons Capital Contributions or Capital Account or to receive any
distribution from the Company, except as expressly provided herein.

 

3.7 _Loans From Members_. Loans by Members to the Company shall not be
considered Capital Contributions. If any Member shall loan funds to the
Company, then the making of such loans shall not result in any increase in the
Capital Account balance of such Member. The amount of any such loans shall be
a debt of the Company to such Member and shall be payable or collectible in
accordance with the terms and conditions upon which such loans are made.

 3.8 _No Right of Partition_. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no
Member shall have the right to seek or obtain partition by court decree or
operation of law of any property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
the right to own or use particular or individual assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement,
be entitled to distributions of specific assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. 

3.9 _Certificates_. The Units shall be issued as uncertificated
securities; provided, however, that the Managing Member may, in its sole
discretion, provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or
all Classes of Units shall be represented by certificates. Certificates of
Units, if any, shall be in such form of certificate as the Managing Member
adopts from time to time.

3.10 _Reimbursement of PDC, Newco, and the Class A Holder for Certain
Expenses_.

(a) The Company shall be responsible for and shall pay all expenses of PDC,
Newco, and the Class A Holder relating to their organization, ownership of
their assets, and their operations (" _Reimbursable Member Expenses_ "). For
the avoidance of doubt, such Reimbursable Member Expenses shall consist of:
(i) overhead, legal, accounting and other professional fees and expenses,
including cost of periodic reports to the Class A Holders security holders,
and any judgments, settlements, penalties, fines or other costs and expenses
in respect of any claims against, or any litigation or proceedings, involving
the Class A Holder, Newco, or PDC (ii) salary, bonus, and other benefits
payable to, and indemnities provided on behalf of, officers, directors and
employees of the Class A Holder, PDC, or Newco, (iii) any director

17 ##### Table of Contents

  

 the board of directors of the Class A Holder, PDC, or Newco (iv) any costs
or expenses related to obtaining directors and officers insurance or any other
insurance reasonably required by the Class A Holder, PDC, or Newco, as
determined by their respective board of directors or other similar governing
body, (v) fees and expenses related to any public offering or private
placement of debt securities or Equity Securities, investment or acquisition
(whether or not successful) authorized by the board of directors of the Class
A Holder, (vi) franchise taxes and other fees and expenses in connection with
the maintenance of existence of the Class A Holder, PDC, or Newco (including,
but not limited to, any costs or expenses associated with being a public
company listed on a national securities exchange in the case of the Class A
Holder) (vii) any payment the proceeds of which are used to purchase or
redeem Equity Securities of Parent in accordance with the terms of the
Exchange Agreement and this Agreement; (viii) expenses of PDC associated with
the maintenance and administration of the PDC ESOP such as those related
to overhead, legal, accounting and other professional fees and expenses such
as the cost of periodic reports issued to the PDC ESOP Beneficiaries
(including the costs of any related valuation reports) and trustees fees
payable to the trustee of the PDC ESOP or any trust formed to administer
payments to ESOP Beneficiaries, but in all events excluding any distributions
to PDC ESOP Beneficiaries with respect to their PDC ESOP account balances,
(ix) any other liability, other than with respect to income tax obligations
of the Class A Holder, PDC, Newco, or the PDC ESOP, that the Managing Member
acting in Good Faith reasonably believes is required to allow the Class A
Holder, PDC, and Newco to operate in the ordinary course or is otherwise
required to prevent the insolvency of the Class A Holder, PDC, or Newco; (x)
expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business by the Class A Holder;
and (xi) expenses approved by the board of directors (or an appropriate
committee thereof) of the Class A Holder; provided, however, that the amount
of any such Reimbursable Member Expenses shall be reduced, to the extent
practicable, by the amount of unused cash remaining from the prior
Company reimbursements of Reimbursable Member Expenses, including any
interest earned thereon and no excess cash that results from such payments
shall be used to make a distribution to its equity holders other than amounts
required pursuant to clause (vii) or (ix) hereof.

(b) Except to the extent provided in this Agreement, the Members entitled
to reimbursement Reimbursable Company Expenses shall be reimbursed on a
monthly basis, or such other basis as the Managing Member acting in Good Faith
reasonably believes is necessary for such Members to satisfy such expenses and
may be satisfied through either reimbursement or direct payment by the
Company of such Reimbursable Company Expenses (if not yet incurred by the
Member entitled to the reimbursement). All payments and reimbursements of
Reimbursable Member Expenses hereunder shall be characterized for federal
income tax purposes as expenses of the Company incurred on its behalf, and not
as expenses of the Member being reimbursed.

(c) If and to the extent any reimbursement to a Member pursuant to this
Section 3.10 constitutes gross income to such Member (as opposed to the
repayment of advances made by such Member on behalf of the Company), such
amounts shall constitute a guaranteed payment with respect to capital within
the meaning of Code Section 707(c), shall be treated consistently therewith by
the Company and all Members, and shall not be treated as a distribution for
purposes of computing the Members Capital Accounts.

_ARTICLE IV_

_DISTRIBUTIONS_

4.1 _Distributions_.

 

(a) Distributions shall be made to the Members, to the extent of available
cash of the Company after Tax Distributions are made pursuant to Section 4.4
hereof, as and when determined by the Managing Member acting in Good Faith,
pro rata (except as otherwise provided herein), in accordance with their
respective Percentage Interests at the record date for such distribution.

(b) In the event of any merger, acquisition, consolidation, reorganization or
other restructuring transaction in which the Company is a party, involving a
payment or distribution of cash, securities or other

 



18 ##### Table of Contents

  

 assets to any Member, the consideration received by the Company or by any
direct or indirect holders of Units or other Equity Securities in connection
with such transaction, net of bona fide expenses of the Company, shall be
distributed to the Members, pro rata, in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests at the time of such distribution.

 

(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to
facilitate the ability of PDC to obtain indemnification to be contributed to
the Company pursuant to Section 5.1(c), to the extent that PDC, any Affiliate
of PDC or Subsidiary of PDC is able to attain indemnification or a
reimbursement payment for environmental or related liabilities, distributions
that PDC would otherwise be entitled to receive to this Agreement, in an
amount equal to the aggregate of such indemnification and reimbursement
payments, shall be held back and not distributed to PDC unless PDC is
not able to attain such indemnification, in which case such held-back sums
shall be distributed to PDC.

 4.2 _Successors_. For purposes of determining the amount of distributions
under Section 4.1, each Member shall be treated as having made the Capital
Contributions and as having received the distributions made to or received
by its predecessors in respect of any of such Members Units.

4.3 _Tax Distributions_. Subject to Section 4.5 and to any restrictions
contained in any agreement to which the Company is bound, no later than the
tenth day following the end of each Quarterly Estimated Tax Period of each
calendar year, the Company shall, to the extent of available cash, make a
distribution in cash (each, a "Tax Distribution"), pro rata in accordance with
the Percentage Interests in effect with respect to such Quarterly Estimated
Tax Period, in an amount equal to the excess of (i) the Assumed Tax Liability
for such Quarterly Estimated Tax Period over (ii) distributions made by the
Company pursuant to this Section 4.3 with respect to such calendar year.
Within thirty (30) days following the date on which the Company files a tax
return on IRS Form 1065 (or any successor form) for any calendar year but no
later than one (1) day prior to the due date for the payment by corporations
of income taxes, the Managing Member shall make a final calculation of the
Assumed Tax Liability for such calendar year (the "Actual Tax Amount"), and
shall cause the Company to distribute to the Members a Tax Distribution pro
rata in accordance with the Percentage Interests in effect with respect to
such calendar year to the extent that the Actual Tax Amount so calculated
exceeds the cumulative Tax Distributions previously made by the Company in
respect of such calendar year. The Managing Member shall use conventions
similar to those adopted pursuant to Section 5.2 of this Agreement to
determine the Percentage Interests of the Members with respect to a Quarterly
Estimated Tax Period and the calendar year. In the event that the Tax
Distributions made to the Members for any calendar year is less than the
Actual Tax Amount due to an insufficiency of available cash and borrowing,
then the Members shall receive additional Tax Distributions out of the first
available cash and borrowing in subsequent calendar years to make up for such
shortfall.

4.4 _Withholding; Security Interest and Right of Set Off; Indemnification_.
If the Company is required by law to make any tax payment to a Governmental
Entity that is specifically attributable to a Member or a Members status as
such (including federal withholding taxes, state or local personal property
taxes and state or local unincorporated business taxes), then such Member
shall indemnify the Company or its successor in interest in full for the
entire amount paid (including interest, penalties and reasonable related
expenses). A Members obligation to indemnify the Company or its successor in
interest under this Section 4.4 shall survive the dissolution, winding up and
termination of the Company. The Company and its successor in interest may
pursue and enforce all rights and remedies it may have against each Member
under this Section 4.4, including instituting a lawsuit to collect such
indemnification, with interest calculated at a rate equal to ten
percent (10%) (but not in excess of the highest rate per annum permitted by
applicable Law). As security for any such indemnification obligation or any
other liability or obligation to which the Company may be subject as a result
of any act or status of any Member, or to which the Company may become
subject with respect to the interest of any Member in the Company, the Company
shall have (and each Member hereby grants to the Company) a security interest
in all Distributable Assets distributable to such Member to the extent of the
amount of such liability or obligation. Whenever the Company is to pay any sum
to any Member or any Affiliate or related Person thereof pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, any amounts that such Member or such Affiliate or related
Person owes to the

 



19 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Company, whether pursuant to this Section 4.4 or under any promissory note
issued to the Company as partial payment for any Units of the Company may be
deducted from that sum before payment; provided, however, that no deduction
pursuant to this sentence shall be made with respect to any Tax Distribution
except on account of any amounts owed by such Member or such Affiliate or
related Person which (i) are due and owing pursuant to the indemnification
obligation provided for in this Section 4.4 or (ii) are past due or as to
which the obligor is otherwise in default.

4.5 _Limitation_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Company, and the Managing Member on behalf of the Company, shall not be
required to make a distribution if such distribution to any Member or

 _ARTICLE V_

_ALLOCATIONS_

5.1 _Allocations for Capital Account Purposes_.

(a) _General Allocations_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
Net Income and Net Losses (and, to the extent necessary, individual items of
income, gain or loss or deduction of the Company) shall be allocated in a
manner such that the Capital Account of each Member after giving effect to
the Special Allocations set forth in Section 5.1(b) is, as nearly as
possible, equal (proportionately) to (i) the distributions that would be made
pursuant to Section 8.3 if the Company were dissolved, its affairs wound up
and its assets sold for cash equal to their Carrying Value, all Company
liabilities were satisfied (limited with respect to each non-recourse
liability to the Carrying Value of the assets securing such liability) and the
net assets of the Company were distributed to the Members pursuant to this
Agreement, _minus_ (ii) such Members share of Company Minimum Gain and Member
Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain, computed immediately prior to the hypothetical
sale of assets.

 

(b) _Special Allocations_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section
5.1, the following special allocations shall be made for such taxable period:

(i) _Company Minimum Gain Chargeback_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Section 5.1, if there is a net decrease in Company Minimum Gain during
any Company taxable period, each Member shall be allocated items of Company
income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent periods) in
the manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulations Sections
1.704-2(f)(6), 1.704-2(g)(2) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(i), or any successor provision.
For purposes of this Section 5.1(b), each Members Adjusted Capital Account
balance shall be determined, and the allocation of income and gain required
hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations
pursuant to this Section 5.1(b) with respect to such taxable period (other
than an allocation pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(iii) and Section 5.1(b)(vi)).
This Section 5.l(b)(i) is intended to comply with the Company Minimum Gain
chargeback requirement in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(f) and shall
be interpreted consistently therewith.

(ii) _Chargeback of Member Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain_. Notwithstanding
the other provisions of this Section 5.1 (other than Section 5.1(b)(i)),
except as provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4), if there is
a net decrease in Member Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain during any Company
taxable period, any Member with a share of Member Nonrecourse Debt Minimum
Gain at the beginning of such taxable period shall be allocated items of
Company income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent
periods) in the manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulations Sections
1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(ii), or any successor provisions. For purposes
of this Section 5.1(b), each Members Adjusted Capital Account balance shall
be determined, and the allocation of income and gain required hereunder shall
be effected, prior to the application of any other

 



20 ##### Table of Contents

  

 allocations pursuant to this Section 5.1(b), other than Section 5.1(b)(i)
and other than an allocation pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(v) and Section
5.1(b)(vi), with respect to such taxable period. This Section 5.1(b)(ii) is
intended to comply with the chargeback of items of income and gain requirement
in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted
consistently therewith.

 

(iii) _Qualified Income Offset_. In the event any Member unexpectedly receives
any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.704-l(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5), or (6), items of Company
income and gain shall be specially allocated to such Member in an amount and
manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury
Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the deficit balance,
if any, in its Adjusted Capital Account created by such adjustments,
allocations or distributions as quickly as possible, unless such deficit
balance is otherwise eliminated pursuant to Section 5.l(b)(i) or Section
5.1(b)(ii). This Section 5.1(b)(iii) is intended to qualify and be construed
as a "qualified income offset" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1 (b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted
consistently therewith.

(iv) _Gross Income Allocations_. In the event any Member has a deficit
balance in its Capital Account at the end of any Company taxable period in
excess of the sum of (A) the amount such Member is required to restore
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and (B) the amount such Member
is deemed obligated to restore pursuant to Treasury Regulations Sections
1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5), such Member shall be specially allocated items
of Company gross income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as
possible; provided, that an allocation pursuant to this Section 5.1(b)(iv)
shall be made only if and to the extent that such Member would have a deficit
balance in its Capital Account as adjusted after all other allocations
provided for in this Section 5.1 have been tentatively made as if this Section
5.l(b)(iv) were not in this Agreement.

(v) _Nonrecourse Deductions_. Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable period
shall be allocated to the Members in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests. If the Managing Member acting in Good Faith determines
that the Companys Nonrecourse Deductions should be allocated in a different
ratio to satisfy the safe harbor requirements of the Treasury Regulations
promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the Managing Member is
authorized, upon notice to the other Members, to revise the prescribed ratio
to the numerically closest ratio that does satisfy such requirements.

 

(vi) _Member Nonrecourse Deductions_. Member Nonrecourse Deductions for any
taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the Member that bears the "Economic
Risk of Loss" (as defined in the Treasury Regulations) with respect to the
Member Nonrecourse Debt to which such Member Nonrecourse Deductions are
attributable in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i). If
more than one Member bears the Economic Risk of Loss with respect to a Member
Nonrecourse Debt, such Member Nonrecourse Deductions attributable thereto
shall be allocated between or among such Members in accordance with the
ratios in which they share such Economic Risk of Loss.

(vii) _Nonrecourse Liabilities_. Nonrecourse Liabilities of the Company
described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3) shall be allocated
among the Members in the manner chosen by the Managing Member acting in Good
Faith and consistent with such Section of the Treasury Regulations.

(viii) _Code Section 754 Adjustments_. To the extent an adjustment to the
adjusted tax basis of any Company asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or 743(b)
of the Code is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1
(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts, the
amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item
of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the
adjustment decreases such basis), and such item of gain or loss shall
be specially allocated to the Members in a manner consistent with the manner
in which their Capital Accounts are required to be adjusted pursuant to such
Section of the Treasury Regulations.

 

(ix) _Curative Allocation_.

 

(1) The allocations set forth in Section 5.1(b)(i)-(viii) (the "Required
Allocations") are intended to comply with certain requirements of the
Treasury Regulations. It is the intent of the

 



21 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Members that, to the extent possible, all Required Allocations shall be
offset either with other Required Allocations or with special allocations of
other items of Company income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to this
Section 5.1(b)(ix)(l). Therefore, notwithstanding any other provision of this
ARTICLE V (other than the Required Allocations), the Managing Member shall
make such offsetting special allocations of Company income, gain, loss or
deduction in whatever manner it determines appropriate acting in Good Faith so
that, after such offsetting allocations are made, each Members Capital
Account balance is, to the extent possible, equal to the Capital
Account balance such Member would have had if the Required Allocations were
not part of this Agreement and all Company items were allocated pursuant to
the economic agreement among the Members.

 

(2) In the event that the Contingency Consideration (as defined in the Equity
Purchase Agreement) is issued to PDC, it is the intent of the Members that,
to the extent possible, all prior allocations of the Companys items of
income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to this Agreement shall be offset
with other allocations of the Companys items of income, gain, loss or
deduction in whatever manner the Managing Member acting in Good Faith
determines appropriate so that, after such offsetting allocations are made,
each Members Capital Account balance is, to the extent possible, equal to
the Capital Account balance such Member would have had if the Percentage
Interests of the Members were determined as if the Contingency Consideration
were issued as of the effective date of the Cross Purchase and all Company
items were allocated pursuant to such adjusted Percentage Interests as of
such date.

(3) The Managing Member shall, with respect to each taxable period, (1) apply
the provisions of Section 5.1(b)(ix)(l) and Section 5.1 (b)(x)(2) in whatever
order is most likely to minimize the economic distortions that might otherwise
result from such allocations, and (2) divide all allocations pursuant to
Section 5.1(b)(ix)(l) and Section 5.1(b)(ix)(1) among the Members in a manner
that is likely to minimize such economic distortions.

 

(x) _Deficit Capital Accounts_. No Member shall be required to pay to the
Company, to any other Member or to any third party any deficit balance which
may exist from time to time in the Members Capital Account.

 

(c) To the extent an indemnification or reimbursement payment is received by
PDC or any Affiliate or Subsidiary of PDC for (x) environmental or related
liabilities or (y) any liabilities directly or indirectly related to the
Company, such payment shall be promptly contributed by PDC to the Company and
the Company shall specially allocate an item of loss or deduction to PDC in
the amount of such payment and contribution, resulting in no net adjustment to
PDCs Capital Account or any Members Percentage Interest as a result of such
payment and contribution.

 

5.2 _Allocations for Tax Purposes_.

 

(a) The income, gains, losses and deductions of the Company shall be allocated
for federal, state and local income tax purposes among the Members in
accordance with the allocation of such income, gains, losses and deductions
among the Members for purposes of computing their Capital Accounts; except
that if any such allocation is not permitted by the Code or other applicable
Law, then the Companys subsequent income, gains, losses and deductions for
tax purposes shall be allocated among the Members so as to reflect as nearly
as possible the allocation set forth herein in computing their Capital
Accounts. 

(b) In an attempt to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities attributable to a
Contributed Property or an Adjusted Property, items of income, gain, loss,
depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions shall be allocated for
federal income tax purposes among the Members as follows:

 

(i)(A) In the case of a Contributed Property, such items attributable thereto
shall be allocated among the Members in the manner provided under Section
704(c) of the Code that takes into account the variation between the Agreed
Value of such property and its adjusted basis at the time of contribution; and
(B) any item of Residual Gain or Residual Loss attributable to a Contributed
Property

 



22 ##### Table of Contents

  

 shall be allocated among the Members in the same manner as its correlative
item of "book" gain or loss is allocated pursuant to Section 5.1.

 

(ii)(A) In the case of an Adjusted Property, such items shall (1) first, be
allocated among the Members in a manner consistent with the principles of
Section 704(c) of the Code to take into account the Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss attributable to such property and the allocations thereof
pursuant to Section 3.5(c)(i) or Section 3.5(c)(ii), and (2) second, in the
event such property was originally a Contributed Property, be allocated among
the Members in a manner consistent with Section 5.2(b)(i)(A); and (B) any item
of Residual Gain or Residual Loss attributable to an Adjusted Property shall
be allocated among the Members in the same manner as its correlative item of
"book" gain or loss is allocated pursuant to Section 5.1.

 

(iii) In order to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities, the Managing Member acting
in Good Faith may cause the Company to use any method described in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-3; provided, however, the Company shall use the
"remedial method" as such term is defined by Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-3(d) in applying Section 704(c) to the Book-Tax Disparity associated
with the Initial Contributed Property as of the Initial Company Capitalization
and the date of this Agreement.

(c) Tax credits, tax credit recapture and any items related thereto shall be
allocated to the Members according to their interests in such items as
reasonably determined by the Managing Member acting in Good Faith taking into
account the principles of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-l(b)(4)(ii).

(d) Allocations pursuant to this Section 5.2 are solely for the purposes of
federal, state and local taxes and shall not affect, or in any way be taken
into account in computing, any Members Capital Account or share of Income,
Loss, distributions or other Company items pursuant to any provision of this
Agreement

5.3  _Other Allocation Rules_. The Company shall "close its books" as of the
end of the day Parent first becomes a Member and shall allocate Net Profits,
Net Losses, or other items allocable to the portion of 2012 ending on
such date to the Persons that were Members of the Company during such portion
of 2012 in accordance with this Agreement. Thereafter, for purposes of
determining the items of Company income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit
allocable to any Member with respect to any period, such items shall be
determined on a daily, monthly, or other basis, as determined by the Managing
Member acting in Good Faith using any permissible method under Code Section
706 and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

5.4 _Members  Tax Reporting_. The Members acknowledge and are aware of the
income tax consequences of the allocations made pursuant to this ARTICLE V
and, except as may otherwise be required by applicable law or regulatory
requirements, hereby agree to be bound by the provisions of this ARTICLE V in
reporting their shares of Company income, gain, loss, deduction and credit
for federal, state and local income tax purposes.

_ ARTICLE VI_

direction of the Managing Member, (ii) the Managing Member may make all
decisions and take all actions for the Company not otherwise provided for in
this Agreement, and (iii) the Managing Member shall possess all powers
necessary, convenient or appropriate to carry out the business of the Company,
including doing all things and taking all actions necessary to carry out the
terms and provisions of this Agreement (and is hereby authorized and directed,
on behalf of the Company and in accordance with the Act, to do all such things
and to take all such actions without any further act, vote, consent or
approval of any Member, unless otherwise specifically required by this
Agreement). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
action to be taken, or determination to be made, by the Managing Member
pursuant to this Agreement shall be taken or made, as the case may be,
through the action of the board of directors (or a duly appointed committee
thereof composed solely of independent directors) of the Managing Member.

 

6.3 _Authority of Members_. In all matters relating to or arising out of the
conduct of the operation of the Company, the decision of the Managing Member
shall be the decision of the Company. Except as required or permitted by
applicable law, or expressly provided in the ultimate sentence of this Section
6.3 or by separate agreement with the Company, no Member who is not also the
Managing Member (and acting in such capacity) shall take any part in the
management or control of the operation or business of the Company in its
capacity as a Member, nor shall any Member who is not also the Managing
Member (and acting in such capacity) have any right, authority or power to act
for or on behalf of or bind the Company in his or its capacity as a Member in
any respect or assume any obligation or responsibility of the Company or of
any other Member. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may employ one or
more Officers from time to time, and such Officers, in their capacity as
employees of the Company, may take part in the control and management of the
business of the Company to the extent such authority and power to act for or
on behalf of the Company has been delegated to such Officers by the Managing
Member.

6.4 _Removal and Replacement of Managing Member_. The Managing Member may not
be removed or replaced at any time with or without the consent of the
Managing Member.

6.5 _Reliance by Third Parties_. Any Person dealing with the Company, other
than a Member, may rely on the authority of the Managing Member (or any
Officer authorized by the Managing Member) in taking any action in the name of
the Company without inquiry into the provisions of this Agreement or
compliance herewith, regardless of whether that action actually is taken in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Every agreement, instrument
or document executed by the Managing Member (or any Officer authorized by the
Managing Member) in the name of the Company with respect to any business or
property of the Company shall be conclusive evidence in favor of any Person
relying thereon or claiming thereunder that (i) at the time of the execution
or delivery thereof, this Agreement was in full force and effect, (ii) such
agreement, instrument or document was duly executed according to this
Agreement and is binding upon the Company and (iii) the Managing Member or
such Officer was duly authorized and empowered to execute and deliver such
agreement, instrument or document for and on behalf of the Company.

until he shall resign or shall have been removed in the manner hereinafter
provided. The salaries or other compensation, if any, of the Officers of the

6.7 _Liability of Members; Officers and Other Covered Persons_.

(a) _No Personal Liability_. Except as otherwise required by the Act
or applicable Law and as expressly set forth in this Agreement, no Member
shall have any personal liability whatsoever in such Persons capacity as a
Member, whether to the Company, to any of the other Members, to the creditors
of the Company or to any other third party, for the debts, liabilities,
commitments or any other obligations of the Company or for any losses of the
Company. Except as otherwise required by the Act, each Member shall be liable
only to make such Members Capital Contribution to the Company, if
applicable, and the other payments provided for expressly herein.

(b)  _Return of Distributions_. In accordance with the Act and the laws of
the State of Delaware, a Member may, under certain circumstances, be required
to return amounts previously distributed to such Member. It is the intent of
the Members that no distribution to any Member pursuant to ARTICLE IV shall
be deemed a return of money or other property paid or distributed in violation
of the Act. The payment of any such money or distribution of any such property
to a Member shall be deemed to be a compromise within the meaning of Section
18-502(b) of the Act, and, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any Member
receiving any such money or property shall not be required to return any such
money or property to the Company or any other Person. However, if any court
of competent jurisdiction holds that, notwithstanding the provisions of this
Agreement, any Member is obligated to make any such payment, such obligation
shall be the obligation of such Member and not of any other Member.

(c) _No Duties_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any
duty otherwise existing at law, in equity or otherwise, the parties hereby
agree that the Members (other than the Managing Member) acting as such, shall,
to the maximum extent permitted by Law, including Section 18-1101(c) of the
Act, owe no duties (including fiduciary duties) to the Company, the other
Members or any other Person who is a party to or otherwise bound by this
Agreement; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 6.7(c)
shall eliminate the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair
dealing. To the extent that, at law or in equity, any Member (including
without limitation, the Class A Holder) has duties (including fiduciary
duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Company, to another Member or
to another Person who is a party to or otherwise bound by this Agreement, the
Members (including without limitation, the Class A Holder) acting under this
Agreement will not be liable to the Company, to any such other Member or to
any such other Person who is a party to or otherwise bound by this Agreement,
for their good faith reliance on the provisions of this Agreement. The
provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict or eliminate
the duties and liabilities relating thereto of any Member (including without
limitation, the Class A Holder) otherwise existing at law, in equity or
otherwise, are agreed by the parties hereto to replace to that extent such
other duties and liabilities of the Members (including without limitation,
the Class A Holder) relating thereto.

(d) _Exculpation_. None of the Managing Member, any affiliate of the Managing
Member, any officer, director, manager, member, employee, stockholder,
partner, representative or agent of the Managing Member or its affiliates and
any Officer shall be personally liable to the Company or its Members for
monetary damages for any actions taken or omitted to be taken with respect to
the Company, including a breach of fiduciary duty by such Managing Member or
Officer, as applicable, except for (i) for any breach of the Managing
Members duty of loyalty to the Company or (ii) liability, as finally
determined in a final non-appealable order, for any loss, claims, damages or
liabilities primarily attributable to such Persons willful
misconduct, recklessness or gross negligence. The Managing Member, the
Officers and the Members, may consult with legal counsel, accountants and
financial or other advisors and any act or omission suffered or taken by the
Managing Member on behalf of the Company or in furtherance of the interests

(e) _Indemnification by the Company_. Subject to the limitations and
conditions provided in this Section 6.7, each Covered Person who was or is
made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in or
participates as a witness in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or arbitrative (each,
a "Proceeding"), or any appeal in such a Proceeding or any inquiry or
investigation that could lead to such a Proceeding, by reason of the fact that
he, she or it, or a Person of which he, she or it is the legal
representative, is or was a Covered Person (each, an "Indemnified Person"), in
each case, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, as the same exists or may
hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the
extent that such amendment permits the Company to provide broader
indemnification rights than such law permitted the Company to provide prior
to such amendment) against all judgments, penalties (including excise and
similar taxes and punitive damages), fines, settlements and reasonable
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) actually incurred
by such Indemnified Person in connection with such Proceeding, appeal,
inquiry or investigation, if such Indemnified Person acted in Good Faith,
except where such person is judicially determined in a final nonappealable
order to have acted in bad faith, to have breached its duty of loyalty to the
Company and the Members, to have committed fraud or to be guilty of a felony
or a misdemeanor involving theft, larceny, embezzlement, misappropriation or
similar crimes or to have otherwise engaged in intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of Law, Reasonable expenses incurred by an Indemnified
Person who was, is or is threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent
in a Proceeding shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final
disposition of the Proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf
of such Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that
he, she or it is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company.
Indemnification under this Section 6.7 shall continue as to a Person who has
ceased to serve in the capacity which initially entitled such Person to
indemnity hereunder.

(f) _Contract Rights; Rights Not Exclusive_. The rights granted pursuant to
this Section 6.7 shall be deemed contract rights, and no amendment,
modification or repeal of this Section 6.7 shall have the effect of limiting
or denying any such rights with respect to actions taken or Proceedings,
appeals, inquiries or investigations arising prior to any amendment,
modification or repeal. The rights to indemnification and payment of expenses
incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition
conferred in this Section 6.7 shall not be exclusive of any other rights which
any Person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this
Agreement, any other agreement, any vote of the Members, or otherwise. It is
expressly acknowledged that the indemnification provided in this Section 6.7
could involve indemnification for negligence or under theories of
strict liability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Indemnified Person shall
be entitled to any indemnity or advancement of expenses in connection with any
Proceeding brought (i) by such Indemnified Person against the Company (other
than to enforce the rights of such Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Section 6.7), any Member or any Officer, or (ii) by or in the right of the
Company, without the prior written consent of the Managing Member.

required to make additional Capital Contributions to help satisfy such
indemnity of the Company.

 

(h) _Insurance_. The Company may purchase and maintain insurance, at its own
expense, on its own behalf and on behalf of any other Person who the Managing
Member acting in Good Faith shall determine, against any liability that may be
asserted or expense that may be incurred by such Persons in connection with
the business or activities of the Company, whether or not the Company would
have the power to indemnify such Person against such liability under this
Section 6.7.

(i) _Employees and Agents_. Persons who are not Covered Persons and who are or
were employees or agents of the Company, or who are or were serving at the
request of the company as employees or agents of another Person, may be
indemnified to the extent authorized at any time or from time to time as
determined

connection with their provision of services to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(b) _Transferees to Execute Accession Agreement_. Each Member agrees that it
shall not, directly or indirectly Transfer any Units (other than to the

(i) such Transfer or Pledge is made to any Person who lacks the legal right,
power or capacity to own such Unit or other interest in the Company;

(ii) such Transfer or Pledge would pose a material risk that the Company would
be a "publicly traded partnership" as defined in Section 7704 of the Code;

Transferred Unit, Equity Security or other Membership Interest in the Company
or of any Class of Unit, Equity Security or other Membership Interest in the
Company pursuant to any applicable United States federal or state securities
laws (including, without limitation, the Securities Act or the Exchange Act)
or other non-U.S. securities laws (including Canadian provincial or
territorial securities laws) or would constitute a non-exempt distribution
pursuant to applicable provincial or state securities laws;

(iv) such Transfer or Pledge would cause any portion of the assets of the
Company to become "plan assets" of any "benefit plan investor" within the
meaning of regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Labor at Section
2510.3-101 of Part 2510 of Chapter XXV, Title 29 of the Code of Federal
Regulations as modified by Section 3(42) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended from time to time;

Agreement or other written instrument evidencing such Assignees consent to be
bound by this Agreement as an Assignee) that are in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Company.

In addition, notwithstanding any contrary provision in this Agreement, to the
extent the Managing Member acting in Good Faith shall determine that interests
in the Company do not meet the requirements of Treasury Regulation section
1.7704-1(h), the Managing Member may impose such restrictions on the Transfer
of Units or other interests in the Company as the Managing Member acting in
Good Faith may reasonably determine to be necessary or advisable so that the
Company is not treated as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a
corporation under Section 7704 of the Code.

Any Transfer or Pledge in violation of Section 8.4 or this Section 8.5(c)
shall be deemed a "Prohibited Transfer" and shall be null and void ab initio

Unit, or other Membership Interest in the Company that is permitted under
Section 8.4 and Section 8.5, the Transferee of such Unit or other interest in

Company and may be waived or released by the Managing Member in its sole
discretion with respect to all or a portion of the Units or other Membership
Interests in the Company owned by any one or more Members or Assignees at any
time and from time to time, and such actions or omissions by the Managing
Member shall not constitute the breach of this Agreement or of any duty
hereunder or otherwise existing at law, in equity or otherwise.

8.7  _Bankruptcy_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Bankruptcy of a Member shall not cause such Member to cease to be a member of
the Company and upon the occurrence of such an event, the Company shall

as may be required under any state or local law applicable to the Company to
cause the Company to be taxable as, and in a manner consistent with,

any action inconsistent with such treatment for U.S. federal, state and local
tax purposes.

purposes, and for purposes of the maintenance of Capital Accounts and the
allocation of Net Profits and Net Losses, including without limitation any

_ARTICLE X_

 

 _DISPUTE RESOLUTION; ARBITRATION_

10.1 _Resolution of Disputes_.

(a) The Members and the Company shall attempt in good faith to resolve any
controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the breach, termination, enforceability or validity hereof (collectively, a
"Dispute") promptly by negotiation between Members, officers or employees who
have authority to settle the Dispute. Any Member or the Company may give any
other Member or the Company a written notice (a "Dispute Notice") setting
forth with reason able specificity the nature of the Dispute and the identity
of such first partys representatives who shall attend and participate in the
meeting at which such parties shall attempt to settle the Dispute. Following
the receipt of a Dispute Notice, the representatives of such Members and/or
the Company shall meet as soon as is practicable at a mutually acceptable time
and place to negotiate in good faith a settlement of the Dispute, and shall
meet thereafter as they reasonably deem necessary. To the fullest extent
permitted by Law, all negotiations pursuant to this ARTICLE X shall be treated
as compromise and settlement negotiations. To the fullest extent permitted
by Law, nothing said or disclosed, nor any document produced, in the course
of such negotiations which is not otherwise independently discoverable shall
be offered or received as evidence or used for impeachment or for any other
purpose in any current or future arbitration or litigation.

(b) If a Dispute has not been resolved within thirty (30) days after the
receipt of a Dispute Notice through negotiation as provided in ARTICLE X, then
the Dispute shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance the
Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") of the American
Arbitration Association ("AAA") and such right to arbitration as set forth
herein shall be the exclusive remedy for the resolution of disputes arising
hereunder. Any award rendered by the arbitrators shall be final and binding
upon the Members and/or Company, and judgment upon such award may be entered
in accordance with applicable Law in any court having jurisdiction. In all
events, the arbitration provisions in this Agreement shall govern over any
conflicting rules that may now or hereafter be contained in the AAA Rules.
The arbitration shall be held in the City of New York, unless the parties to
such arbitration mutually agree to have such arbitration held elsewhere;
provided, however, that nothing contained in this ARTICLE X shall be
construed to limit or preclude a Member from bringing any action in the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware for injunctive or other provisional
relief to prevent immediate and irreparable harm. In the event such an action
does not fall within the scope of subject matter jurisdiction of Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, such an action may be brought in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County. The Company and the
Members agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts
referenced in the preceding sentence in the event that an action is commenced
pursuant to the preceding sentence.

10.2 _Arbitrators_. Any arbitration proceeding commenced pursuant to this
ARTICLE X shall be conducted before three (3) arbitrators, at least one
of whom shall be an attorney experienced in corporate transactions. The
arbitrators shall be chosen in accordance with the AAA Rules. Notwithstanding
the preceding sentence, to the extent that any Dispute hereunder involves the
Class A Holder or the Company, on the one hand, and one or more Members other
than the Class A Holder, on the other hand, one arbitrator shall be chosen by
the Class A Holder, one arbitrator shall be chosen by the Members other than
the Class A Holder, and the third arbitrator shall be chosen by the other two
(2) arbitrators, or, if they should fail to agree on the third arbitrator, by
the AAA. Each party shall be entitled to reasonable discovery rights, and
issues as to discovery shall be determined by the arbitral panel applying the
Laws of the State of Delaware as more fully provided in Section 10.3 and
Section 11.2. The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be the
decision of the arbitrators. The arbitrators will have no authority to award
punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing partys actual
damages, except as may be required by statute. Any award by the arbitrators
shall be accompanied by a reasoned opinion.

 

10.3 _Delaware Arbitration Act_. This ARTICLE X shall be construed to the
maximum extent possible to comply with the laws of the State of Delaware,
including the Uniform Arbitration Act (10 Del. C. § 5701 _et seq_.)

 



38 ##### Table of Contents

  

 (the "Delaware Arbitration Act"). If, nevertheless, it shall be determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction that any provision or wording of this
ARTICLE X, including any AAA Rules, shall be invalid or unenforceable under
the Delaware Arbitration Act or other applicable Law, such invalidity shall
not invalidate all of this ARTICLE X. In that case, this ARTICLE X shall be
construed so as to limit any term or provision so as to make it valid or
enforceable within the requirements of the Delaware Arbitration Act or other
applicable Law, and, in the event such term or provision cannot be so limited,
this ARTICLE X shall be construed to omit such invalid or unenforceable
provision.

to this Plan or any Award hereunder. Each Indemnifiable Person shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from (and the Company
shall pay or reimburse on demand for) any loss, cost, liability, or expense
(including attorneys fees) that may be imposed upon or incurred by such
Indemnifiable Person in connection with or resulting from any action, suit or
proceeding to which such Indemnifiable Person may be a party or in which such
Indemnifiable Person may be involved by reason of any action taken or omitted
to be taken under this Plan or any Award agreement and against and from any
and all amounts paid by such Indemnifiable Person with the Companys
approval, in settlement thereof, or paid by such Indemnifiable Person in
satisfaction of any judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding against
such Indemnifiable Person, provided, that the Company shall have the right, at
its own expense, to assume and defend any such action, suit or proceeding and
once the Company gives notice of its intent to assume the defense, the Company
shall have sole control over such defense with counsel of the Companys
choice. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be available to an
Indemnifiable Person to the extent that a final judgment or other final
adjudication (in either case not subject to further appeal) binding upon such
Indemnifiable Person determines that the acts or omissions of such
Indemnifiable Person giving rise to the indemnification claim resulted from
such Indemnifiable Persons bad faith, fraud or willful criminal act or
omission or that such right of indemnification is otherwise prohibited by law
or by the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws. The foregoing
right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of
indemnification to which such Indemnifiable Persons may be entitled under
the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, as a matter of law, or
otherwise, or any other power that the Company may have to indemnify such
Indemnifiable Persons or hold them harmless.

 for other Awards under this Plan. Common Shares underlying Awards under this
Plan that are forfeited, cancelled, expire unexercised, or are settled in cash
are available again for Awards under this Plan.

(d) Common Shares delivered by the Company in settlement of Awards may be
authorized and unissued shares, shares held in the treasury of the Company,
shares purchased on the open market or by private purchase, or a combination
of the foregoing.

(e) Awards may, in the sole discretion of the Committee, be granted under this
Plan in assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously
granted by an entity acquired by the Company or with which the Company
combines ("Substitute Awards"). The number of Common Shares underlying any
Substitute Awards shall be counted against the aggregate number of Common
Shares available for Awards under this Plan.

 

6\. _Eligibility_. Participation shall be limited to Eligible Persons who have
entered into an Award agreement or who have received written notification
from the Committee, or from a person designated by the Committee, that they
have been selected to participate in this Plan.

7\. _Options_.

(a) _Generally_. Each Option granted under this Plan shall be evidenced by an
Award agreement (whether in paper or electronic medium (including email or the
posting on a web site maintained by the Company or a third party under
contract with the Company)). Each Option so granted shall be subject to the
conditions set forth in this Section 7, and to such other conditions not
inconsistent with this Plan as may be reflected in the applicable Award
agreement. All Options granted under this Plan shall be Nonqualified Stock
Options unless the applicable Award agreement expressly states that the Option
is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option. Nonqualified Stock Options shall
be granted only to Eligible Persons who are current or prospective employees,
directors, consultants or advisors of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Incentive Stock Options shall be granted only to Eligible Persons who are
employees of the Company and its Related Companies, and no Incentive Stock
Option shall be granted to any Eligible Person who is ineligible to receive
an Incentive Stock Option under the Code. No Option shall be treated as an
Incentive Stock Option unless this Plan has been approved by the stockholders
of the Company in a manner intended to comply with the stockholder approval
requirements of Section 422(b)(1) of the Code, provided that any Option
intended to be an Incentive Stock Option shall not fail to be effective solely
on account of a failure to obtain such approval, but rather such Option shall
be treated as a Nonqualified Stock Option unless and until such approval is
obtained. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the terms and conditions
of such grant shall be subject to and comply with such rules as may
be prescribed by Section 422 of the Code. If for any reason an Option
intended to be an Incentive Stock Option (or any portion thereof) does not
qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, then, to the extent of such
nonqualification, such Option or portion thereof shall be regarded as a
Nonqualified Stock Option appropriately granted under this Plan.

(b)  _Exercise Price_. The exercise price ("Exercise Price") per Common Share
for each Option shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of such
Common Share determined as of the Date of Grant; provided, however, that in
the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an employee who, at the time
of the grant of such Option, owns (or is deemed to own pursuant to Section
424(d) of the Code) stock representing more than 10% of the voting power of
all classes of stock of the Company or any Related Company, the Exercise
Price per share shall not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per share
on the Date of Grant and provided further that, notwithstanding any provision
herein to the contrary, the Exercise Price shall not be less than the par
value per Common Share.

(c) _Vesting and Expiration_. Options shall vest and become exercisable in
such manner and on such date or dates determined by the Committee and shall
expire after such period, not to exceed ten years, as may be determined by the
Committee (the "Option Period"); provided, however, that the Option Period
shall not exceed five years from the Date of Grant in the case of an Incentive
Stock Option granted to a Participant who on the Date of Grant owns (or is
deemed to own pursuant to Section 424(d) of the Code) stock representing more
than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any
Related

 Company; _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding any vesting dates set
by the Committee, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the
exercisability of any Option, which acceleration shall not affect the terms
and conditions of such Option other than with respect to exercisability.
Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in an Award agreement: (i) the
unvested portion of an Option shall expire upon termination of employment or
service of the Participant granted the Option, and the vested portion of such
Option shall remain exercisable for (A) one year following termination of
employment or service by reason of such Participants death or disability (as
determined by the Committee), but not later than the expiration of the Option
Period or (B) three months following termination of employment or service for
any reason other than such Participants death or disability, and other than
such Participants termination of employment or service for Cause, but not
later than the expiration of the Option Period; and (ii) both the unvested and
the vested portion of an Option shall expire and be forfeited upon the
termination of the Participants employment or service by the Company for
Cause. For purposes of this Section 7(c), "termination of employment or
service" means, in the case of a Nonqualified Stock Option, termination of
employment or service with the Company and all Affiliates; and in the case of
an Incentive Stock Option, termination of employment with the Company and all
Related Companies.

 

(d) _Method of Exercise and Form of Payment_. No Common Shares shall be
delivered pursuant to any exercise of an Option until payment in full of the
Exercise Price therefor is received by the Company and the Participant has
paid to the Company an amount equal to any federal, state, local and non-U.S.
income and employment taxes required to be withheld. Options that have become
exercisable may be exercised by delivery of written or electronic notice of
exercise to the Company in accordance with the terms of the Option accompanied
by payment of the Exercise Price. The Exercise Price shall be payable (i) in
cash, check, cash equivalent and/or Common Shares valued at the Fair Market
Value at the time the Option is exercised (including, pursuant to procedures
approved by the Committee, by means of attestation of ownership of a
sufficient number of Common Shares in lieu of actual delivery of such Common
Shares to the Company); provided, that such Common Shares are not subject to
any pledge or other security interest and are Mature Shares and; (ii) by such
other method as the Committee may permit in accordance with applicable law,
in its sole discretion, including without limitation: (A) in other property
having a fair market value on the date of exercise equal to the Exercise Price
or (B) if there is a public market for the Common Shares at such time, by
means of a broker-assisted "cashless exercise" pursuant to which the Company
is delivered a copy of irrevocable instructions to a stockbroker to sell the
Common Shares otherwise deliverable upon the exercise of the Option and to
deliver promptly to the Company an amount equal to the Exercise Price or (C)
by a "net exercise" method whereby the Company withholds from the delivery of
the Common Shares for which the Option was exercised that number of Common
Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the aggregate Exercise Price for
the Common Shares for which the Option was exercised. Any fractional Common
Shares shall be settled in cash.

 

(e) _Notification upon Disqualifying Disposition of an Incentive Stock
Option_. Each Participant awarded an Incentive Stock Option under this Plan
shall notify the Company in writing immediately after the date he makes a
disqualifying disposition of any Common Shares acquired pursuant to the
exercise of such Incentive Stock Option. A disqualifying disposition is any
disposition (including, without limitation, any sale) of such Common Shares
before the later of (A) two years after the Date of Grant of the Incentive
Stock Option or (B) one year after the date of exercise of the Incentive
Stock Option. The Company may, if determined by the Committee and in
accordance with procedures established by the Committee, retain possession of
any Common Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Incentive Stock
Option as agent for the applicable Participant until the end of the period
described in the preceding sentence.

(f)  _Compliance With Laws, etc_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall a Participant be permitted to exercise an Option in a manner that the
Committee determines would violate the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, if
applicable, or any other applicable law or the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the applicable rules
and regulations of any securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on
which the securities of the Company are listed or traded.

8\. _Stock Appreciation Rights_.

 

(a) _Generally_. Each SAR granted under this Plan shall be evidenced by an
Award agreement (whether in paper or electronic medium (including email or
the posting on a web site maintained by the Company or a third party under
contract with the Company)). Each SAR so granted shall be subject to the
conditions set forth in this Section 8, and to such other conditions not
inconsistent with this Plan as may be reflected in the applicable Award
agreement. SARs shall be granted only to Eligible Persons who are current or
prospective employees, directors, consultants or advisors of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. Any Option granted under this Plan may include tandem
SARs. The Committee also may award SARs to Eligible Persons independent of any
Option.

(b) _Exercise Price_. The Exercise Price per Common Share for each Option
shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of such Common Share
determined as of the Date of Grant. 

(c) _Vesting and Expiration_. A SAR granted in connection with an Option shall
become exercisable and shall expire according to the same vesting schedule
and expiration provisions as the corresponding Option. A SAR granted
independent of an Option shall vest and become exercisable and shall expire in
such manner and on such date or dates determined by the Committee and shall
expire after such period, not to exceed ten years, as may be determined by the
Committee (the "SAR Period"); provided, however, that notwithstanding any
vesting dates set by the Committee, the Committee may, in its sole
discretion, accelerate the exercisability of any SAR, which acceleration shall
not affect the terms and conditions of such SAR other than with respect to
exercisability. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in an Award
agreement: (i) the unvested portion of a SAR shall expire upon termination of
employment or service with the Company and all Affiliates of the Participant
granted the SAR, and the vested portion of such SAR shall remain exercisable
for (A) one year following termination of employment or service by reason of
such Participants death or disability (as determined by the Committee), but
not later than the expiration of the SAR Period or (B) three months
following termination of employment or service with the Company and all
Affiliates for any reason other than such Participants death or disability,
and other than such Participants termination of employment or service for
Cause, but not later than the expiration of the SAR Period; and (ii) both the
unvested and the vested portion of a SAR shall expire and be forfeited upon
the termination of the Participants employment or service by the Company for
Cause.

 

(d) _Method of Exercise_. SARs that have become exercisable may be exercised
by delivery of written or electronic notice of exercise to the Company in
accordance with the terms of the Award, specifying the number of SARs to be
exercised and the date on which such SARs were awarded. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if on the last day of the Option Period (or in the case of a SAR
independent of an Option, the SAR Period), the Fair Market Value exceeds the
Strike Price, the Participant has not exercised the SAR or the corresponding
Option (if applicable), and neither the SAR nor the corresponding Option (if
applicable) has expired, such SAR shall be deemed to have been exercised by
the Participant on such last day and the Company shall make the appropriate
payment therefor.

 

(e) _Payment_. Upon the exercise of a SAR, the Company shall pay to the
Participant an amount equal to the number of Common Shares subject to the SAR
that are being exercised multiplied by the excess, if any, of the Fair Market
Value of one Common Share on the exercise date over the Strike Price, less an
amount equal to any federal, state, local and non-U.S. income and employment
taxes required to be withheld. The Company shall pay such amount in cash, in
Common Shares valued at Fair Market Value, or any combination thereof, as
determined by the Committee. Any fractional Common Share shall be settled in
cash.

(f) _Reduction in the Underlying Common Shares_. Upon any exercise of a
tandem SAR, the number of Common Shares for which any related Option will be
exercisable will be reduced by the number of Common Shares for which the SAR
has been exercised. The number of Common Shares for which a tandem SAR is
exercisable will be reduced upon any exercise of any related Option by the
number of Common Shares for which such Option has been exercised.

9\. _Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units_.

 

(a) _Generally_. Each grant of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
shall be evidenced by an Award agreement (whether in paper or electronic
medium (including email or the posting on a web site maintained by the Company
or a third party under contract with the Company)). Each such grant shall be
subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 9, and to such other
conditions not inconsistent with this Plan as may be reflected in the
applicable Award agreement.

(b) _Restricted Accounts; Escrow or Similar Arrangement_. Upon the grant of
Restricted Stock, a book entry in a restricted account shall be established in
the Participants name at the Companys transfer agent and, if the Committee
determines that the Restricted Stock shall be held by the Company or in escrow
rather than held in such restricted account pending the release of the
applicable restrictions, the Committee may require the Participant to
additionally execute and deliver to the Company (i) an escrow agreement
satisfactory to the Committee, if applicable, and (ii) the appropriate share
power (endorsed in blank) with respect to the Restricted Stock covered by
such agreement. If a Participant shall fail to execute an agreement evidencing
an Award of Restricted Stock and, if applicable, an escrow agreement and blank
share power within the amount of time specified by the Committee, the
Award shall be null and void. Subject to the restrictions set forth in this
Section 9 and the applicable Award agreement, the Participant generally shall
have the rights and privileges of a stockholder as to such Restricted Stock,
including without limitation the right to vote such Restricted Stock and the
right to receive dividends, if applicable. To the extent shares of Restricted
Stock are forfeited, any share certificates issued to the Participant
evidencing such shares shall be returned to the Company, and all rights of
the Participant to such shares and as a stockholder with respect thereto shall
terminate without further obligation on the part of the Company.

 

(c) _Vesting; Acceleration of Lapse of Restrictions_. Unless otherwise
provided by the Committee in an Award agreement: (i) the Restricted Period
shall lapse with respect to 100% of the Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock
Units on the third anniversary of the Date of Grant; and (ii) the unvested
portion of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall terminate and be
forfeited upon termination of employment or service with the Company and all
Affiliates of the Participant granted the applicable Award.

 

(d) _Delivery of Restricted Stock and Settlement of Restricted Stock Units_.

 

(i) Upon the expiration of the Restricted Period with respect to any shares of
Restricted Stock and the satisfaction of any other conditions prescribed by
the Committee (including, without limitation, the Participants satisfaction
of applicable tax withholding obligations attributable to the Award), the
restrictions set forth in the applicable Award agreement shall be of no
further force or effect with respect to such Common Shares, except as set
forth in the applicable Award agreement. If an escrow arrangement is used,
upon such expiration, the Company shall deliver to the Participant, or
his beneficiary, without charge, the share certificate evidencing the shares
of Restricted Stock that have not then been forfeited and with respect to
which the Restricted Period has expired (rounded down to the nearest full
share). Dividends, if any, that may have been withheld by the Committee and
attributable to any particular share of Restricted Stock shall be distributed
to the Participant in cash or, at the sole discretion of the Committee, in
Common Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such
dividends, upon the release of restrictions on such share and, if such share
is forfeited, the Participant shall have no right to such dividends (except as
otherwise set forth by the Committee in the applicable Award agreement).

(ii) Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in an Award agreement, upon
the expiration of the Restricted Period with respect to any outstanding
Restricted Stock Units, the Company shall deliver to the Participant, or his
beneficiary, without charge, one Common Share for each such outstanding
Restricted Stock Unit; provided, however, that the Committee may, in its sole
discretion, elect to (i) pay cash or part cash and part Common Share in lieu
of delivering only Common Shares in respect of such Restricted Stock Units or
(ii) defer the delivery of Common Shares (or cash or part Common Shares and
part cash, as the case may be) beyond the expiration of the Restricted Period
if such delivery would result in a violation of applicable law until such time
as is no longer the case. If a cash 

 



11 ##### Table of Contents

  

 payment is made in lieu of delivering Common Shares, the amount of such
payment shall be equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common Shares as of the
date on which the Restricted Period lapsed with respect to such Restricted
Stock Units, less an amount equal to any federal, state, local and non-U.S.
income and employment taxes required to be withheld.

10\. _Stock Bonus Awards_. The Committee may issue unrestricted Common Shares,
or other Awards denominated in Common Shares, under this Plan to Eligible
Persons, either alone or in tandem with other Awards, in such amounts as the
Committee shall from time to time in its sole discretion determine. Each Stock
Bonus Award granted under this Plan shall be evidenced by an Award agreement
(whether in paper or electronic medium (including email or the posting on a
web site maintained by the Company or a third party under contract with the
Company)). Each Stock Bonus Award so granted shall be subject to such
conditions not inconsistent with this Plan as may be reflected in the
applicable Award agreement.

11\. _Performance Compensation Awards_.

 

(a) _Generally_. The Committee shall have the authority, at the time of grant
of any Award described in Sections 7 through 10 of this Plan, to designate
such Award as a Performance Compensation Award intended to qualify as
"performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code. The
Committee shall have the authority to make an Award of a cash bonus to any
Participant and designate such Award as a Performance Compensation Award
intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m)
of the Code.

 

(b) _Discretion of Committee with Respect to Performance Compensation Awards_.
With regard to a particular Performance Period, the Committee shall have sole
discretion to select the length of such Performance Period, the type(s) of
Performance Compensation Awards to be issued, the Performance Criteria that
will be used to establish the Performance Goal(s), the kind(s) and/or
level(s) of the Performance Goals(s) that is (are) to apply and the
Performance Formula. Within the first 90 calendar days of a Performance Period
(or, if longer or shorter, within the maximum period allowed under Section
162(m) of the Code, if applicable), the Committee shall, with regard to the
Performance Compensation Awards to be issued for such Performance Period,
exercise its discretion with respect to each of the matters enumerated in
the immediately preceding sentence and record the same in writing.

(c) _Performance Criteria_. The Performance Criteria that will be used to
establish the Performance Goal(s) shall be based on the attainment of specific
levels of performance of the Company one or more Related Companies, divisions
or operational units, a Participant, or any combination of the foregoing, and
shall include the following: (i) gross or net earnings or gross or net income
(before or after taxes); (ii) basic or diluted earnings per share (before or
after taxes); (iii) net revenue or revenue growth; (iv) gross profit or gross
profit growth; (v) operating profit (before or after taxes); (vi) return on
assets, capital, invested capital, equity, or sales; (vii) cash flow
(including operating cash flow, free cash flow, and cash flow return on
capital); (viii) earnings before or after all or any of interest expense,
taxes, depreciation and/or amortization; (ix) gross or operating margins; (x)
productivity ratios; (xi) share price (including growth measures and total
stockholder return); (xii) expense targets; (xiii) margins; (xiv) operating
efficiency; (xv) objective measures of customer satisfaction; (xvi) working
capital targets; (xvii) economic value added; (xviii) inventory control;
(xix) enterprise value; (xx) sales; (xxi) debt levels and net debt; (xxii)
combined ratio; (xxiii) launch or acquisition (including the timings
therefore) of new stores or other facilities; (xxiv) customer retention;
(xxv) employee retention; (xxvi) timely completion of new product rollouts;
and (xxxiii) objective measures of personal targets, goals or completion of
projects. Any one or more of the Performance Criteria may be used on an
absolute or relative basis to measure the performance of the Company as a
whole and/or one or more Related Companies as a whole or any business unit(s)
of the Company and/or one or more Related Companies or any combination
thereof, as the Committee may deem appropriate, or any of the above
Performance Criteria may be compared to the performance of a selected group of
comparison companies, or a published or special index that the Committee, in
its sole discretion, deems appropriate, or as compared to various stock
market indices. The Committee also has the authority to provide for
accelerated vesting of any Award based on the achievement of Performance Goals
pursuant to the Performance Criteria specified in

 



12 ##### Table of Contents

  

 this paragraph. To the extent required under Section 162(m) of the Code, the
Committee shall, within the first 90 calendar days of a Performance Period
(or, if longer or shorter, within the maximum period allowed under Section
162(m) of the Code), define in an objective fashion the manner of calculating
the Performance Criteria it selects to use for such Performance Period and
thereafter promptly communicate such Performance Criteria to the Participant.

(d) _Modification of Performance Goal(s)_. In the event that applicable tax
and/or securities laws change to permit Committee discretion to alter the
governing Performance Criteria without obtaining stockholder approval of such
alterations, the Committee shall have sole discretion to make such
alterations without obtaining stockholder approval. The Committee is
authorized at any time during the first 90 calendar days of a Performance
Period (or, if longer or shorter, within the maximum period allowed under
Section 162(m) of the Code, if applicable), or at any time thereafter to the
extent the exercise of such authority at such time would not cause the
Performance Compensation Awards granted to any Participant for such
Performance Period to fail to qualify as "performance-based compensation"
under Section 162(m) of the Code, in its sole discretion, to adjust or modify
the calculation of a Performance Goal for such Performance Period, based on
and in order to appropriately reflect the following events: (i) asset write-
downs; (ii) litigation or claim judgments or settlements; (iii) the effect of
changes in tax laws, accounting principles, or other laws or regulatory rules
affecting reported results; (iv) any reorganization and restructuring
programs; (v) extraordinary nonrecurring items as described in Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 30 (or any successor pronouncement thereto)
and/or in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations appearing in the Companys annual report to
stockholders for the applicable year; (vi) acquisitions or divestitures; (vii)
any other specific unusual or nonrecurring events, or objectively determinable
category thereof; (viii) foreign exchange gains and losses; and (ix) a change
in the Companys fiscal year.

(e) _Payment of Performance Compensation Awards_.

(i)  _Condition to Receipt of Payment_. Unless otherwise provided in the
applicable Award agreement, a Participant must be employed by the Company on
the last day of a Performance Period to be eligible for payment in respect of
a Performance Compensation Award for such Performance Period.

(ii) _Limitation_. A Participant shall be eligible to receive payment in
respect of a Performance Compensation Award only to the extent that: (A) the
Performance Goals for such period are achieved; and (B) all or some of the
portion of such Participants Performance Compensation Award has been earned
for the Performance Period based on the application of the Performance Formula
to such achieved Performance Goals.

(iii) _Certification_. Following the completion of a Performance Period, the
Committee shall review and certify in writing whether, and to what extent, the
Performance Goals for the Performance Period have been achieved and, if so,
calculate and certify in writing that amount of the Performance Compensation
Awards earned for the period based upon the Performance Formula. The Committee
shall then determine the amount of each Participants Performance
Compensation Award actually payable for the Performance Period and, in so
doing, may apply Negative Discretion.

(iv) _Use of Negative Discretion_. In determining the actual amount of an
individual Participants Performance Compensation Award for a Performance
Period, the Committee may reduce or eliminate the amount of the Performance
Compensation Award earned under the Performance Formula in the Performance
Period through the use of Negative Discretion if, in its sole judgment, such
reduction or elimination is appropriate. The Committee shall not have the
discretion, except as is otherwise provided in this Plan, to (A) grant or
provide payment in respect of Performance Compensation Awards for a
Performance Period if the Performance Goals for such Performance Period have
not been attained; or (B) increase a Performance Compensation Award above the
applicable limitations set forth in Section 5 of this Plan.

(f) _Timing of Award Payments_. Performance Compensation Awards granted for a
Performance Period shall be paid to Participants as soon as administratively
practicable following completion of the

 



13 ##### Table of Contents

  

 certifications required by this Section 11, but in no event later than two-
and-one-half months following the end of the fiscal year during which the
Performance Period is completed. 

12\. _Changes in Capital Structure and Similar Events_. In the event of (a)
any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Common
Shares, other securities or other property), recapitalization, stock split,
reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, amalgamation, consolidation,
split-up, split-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of Common Shares or
other securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to
acquire Common Shares or other securities of the Company, or other similar
corporate transaction or event (including, without limitation, a Change in
Control) that affects the Common Shares, or (b) unusual or nonrecurring events
(including, without limitation, a Change in Control) affecting the Company,
any Affiliate, or the financial statements of the Company or any Affiliate, or
changes in applicable rules, rulings, regulations or other requirements of
any governmental body or securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system,
accounting principles or law, such that in either case an adjustment is
determined by the Committee in its sole discretion to be necessary or
appropriate, then the Committee shall make any such adjustments that are
equitable, including without limitation any or all of the following:

 

(i) adjusting any or all of (A) the number of Common Shares or other
securities of the Company (or number and kind of other securities or other
property) that may be delivered in respect of Awards or with respect to which
Awards may be granted under this Plan (including, without limitation,
adjusting any or all of the limitations under Section 5 of this Plan) and (B)
the terms of any outstanding Award, including, without limitation, (1) the
number of Common Shares or other securities of the Company (or number and kind
of other securities or other property) subject to outstanding Awards or
to which outstanding Awards relate, (2) the Exercise Price or Strike Price
with respect to any Award or (3) any applicable performance measures
(including, without limitation, Performance Criteria and Performance Goals);

 

(ii) providing for a substitution or assumption of Awards, accelerating the
exercisability of, lapse of restrictions on, or termination of, Awards or
providing for a period of time for exercise prior to the occurrence of such
event; and

(iii) canceling any one or more outstanding Awards and causing to be paid to
the holders thereof, in cash, Common Shares, other securities or other
property, or any combination thereof, the value of such Awards, if any, as
determined by the Committee (which if applicable may be based upon the price
per Common Share received or to be received by other stockholders of the
Company in such event), including without limitation, in the case of
an outstanding Option or SAR, a cash payment in an amount equal to the
excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value (as of a date specified by the
Committee) of the Common Shares subject to such Option or SAR over the
aggregate Exercise Price or Strike Price of such Option or SAR, respectively
(it being understood that, in such event, any Option or SAR having a per share
Exercise Price or Strike Price equal to, or in excess of, the Fair Market
Value of a Common Share subject thereto may be canceled and terminated
without any payment or consideration therefor);

_provided_ , _however_ , that in the ease of any "equity restructuring"
(within the meaning of the financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) or ASC Topic 718, or any
successor thereto), the Committee shall make an equitable or proportionate
adjustment to outstanding Awards to reflect such equity restructuring. Any
adjustment in Incentive Stock Options under this Section 12 (other than any
cancellation of Incentive Stock Options) shall be made only to the extent not
constituting a "modification" within the meaning of Section 424(h)(3) of the
Code, and any adjustments under this Section 12 shall be made in a manner that
does not adversely affect the exemption provided pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under
the Exchange Act. The Company shall give each Participant notice of an
adjustment hereunder and, upon notice, such adjustment shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes.

13\. _Effect of Change in Control_. Except to the extent otherwise provided in
an Award agreement, in the event of a Change in Control, notwithstanding any
provision of this Plan to the contrary and in furtherance of, and not in
limitation of, the provisions of Section 12, the Committee may provide that,
with respect to all or any portion of a particular outstanding Award or
Awards:

(a) all of the then outstanding Options and SARs shall immediately vest and
become immediately exercisable as of a time prior to the Change in Control;

(b) the Restricted Period shall expire as of a time prior to the Change in
Control (including without limitation a waiver of any applicable Performance
Goals);

(c) Performance Periods in effect on the date the Change in Control occurs
shall end on such date, and the Committee shall (i) determine the extent to
which Performance Goals with respect to each such Performance Period have
been met based upon such audited or unaudited financial information or other
information then available as it deems relevant and (ii) cause the Participant
to receive partial or full payment of Awards for each such Performance Period
based upon the Committees determination of the degree of attainment of the
Performance Goals, or assuming that the applicable "target" levels of
performance have been attained or on such other basis determined by the
Committee.

To the extent practicable, any actions taken by the Committee under the
immediately preceding clauses (a) through (c) shall occur in a manner and at
a time which allows affected Participants the ability to participate in the
Change in Control transactions with respect to the Common Shares subject to
their Awards.

 

14\. _Amendments and Termination_.

(a) _Amendment and Termination of this Plan_. The Board may amend, alter,
suspend, discontinue, or terminate this Plan or any portion thereof at any
time; _provided_ , that (i) no amendment to Section 11(c) or Section 14(b)
(to the extent required by the proviso in such Section 14(b)) shall be made
without stockholder approval and (ii) no such amendment, alteration,
suspension, discontinuation or termination shall be made without stockholder
approval if such approval is necessary to comply with any tax or regulatory
requirement applicable to this Plan (including, without limitation, as
necessary to comply with any rules or requirements of any securities exchange
or inter-dealer quotation system on which the Common Shares may be listed or
quoted or to prevent the Company from being denied a tax deduction under
Section 162(m) of the Code); provided, further, that any such amendment,
alteration, suspension, discontinuance or termination that would materially
and adversely affect the rights of any Participant or any holder or
beneficiary of any Award theretofore granted shall not to that extent be
effective without the consent of the affected Participant, holder or
beneficiary.

(b) _Amendment of Award Agreements_. The Committee may, to the extent
consistent with the terms of any applicable Award agreement, waive any
conditions or rights under, amend any terms of, or alter, suspend,
discontinue, cancel or terminate, any Award theretofore granted or
the associated Award agreement, prospectively or retroactively; provided that
any such waiver, amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuance,
cancellation or termination that would materially and adversely affect the
rights of any Participant with respect to any Award theretofore granted shall
not to that extent be effective without the consent of the affected
Participant; _provided_ , _further_ , that without stockholder approval,
except as otherwise permitted under Section 12 of this Plan, (i) no amendment
or modification may reduce the Exercise Price of any Option or the Strike
Price of any SAR, (ii) the Committee may not cancel any outstanding Option or
SAR and replace it with a new Option or SAR, another Award or cash and (iii)
the Committee may not take any other action that is considered a "repricing"
for purposes of the stockholder approval rules of the applicable securities
exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on which the Common Shares are
listed or quoted.

15\. _Restrictive Covenants_.

 

(a) _Confidentiality_. By accepting an Award under this Plan, and as a
condition thereof, each Participant agrees not to, at any time, either during
their employment or thereafter, divulge, use, publish or

may be necessary to the performance of the Participants duties to the
Company, (ii) with the Companys express written consent, (iii) to the extent

subpoena or other government process and in such event, the Participant shall
cooperate with the Company in attempting to keep such information confidential

or personal manner at any time during or following his or her employment.

 

(c) _Post-Employment Property_. By accepting an Award under this Plan, and as
a condition thereof, the Participant agrees that any work of authorship,
invention, design, discovery, development, technique, improvement, source
code, hardware, device, data, apparatus, practice, process, method or other
work product whatever (whether patentable or subject to copyright or other
intellectual property protection, or not, and hereinafter collectively called
"discovery") related to the business of the Company that the Participant,
either solely or in collaboration with others, has made or may make,
discover, invent, develop, perfect, or reduce to practice during his, her or
its employment by or association with the Company, whether or not during
regular business hours and created, conceived or prepared on the
Companys premises or otherwise shall be the sole and complete property of
the Company. More particularly, and without limiting the foregoing, the
Participant agrees that all of the foregoing and any (i) inventions (whether

conceived, or prepared on the Companys premises or otherwise, whether or not
during normal business hours, shall perpetually and throughout the world be
the exclusive property of the Company, as shall all tangible media (including,
but not limited to, papers, computer media of all types, and models) in which
such Intellectual Property Products shall be recorded or otherwise fixed. The
Participant further agrees promptly to disclose in writing and deliver to the
Company all Intellectual Property Products created during his, her or its
employment by or association with the Company, whether or not during normal
business hours. The Participant agrees that all works of authorship created by
the Participant during his, her or its employment by or association with the
Company shall be works made for hire of which the Company is the author and
owner of copyright or other rights thereto. To the extent that any competent
decision-making authority should ever determine that any work of authorship
created by the Participant during his, her or its employment by or
association with the Company is not a work made for hire, by accepting an
Award, the Participant assigns (without royalty or other compensation) all
right, title and interest in the copyright or other intellectual property
therein, in perpetuity and throughout the world, to the Company. To the extent
that this Plan does not otherwise serve to grant or otherwise vest in the
Company all rights in any Intellectual Property Product created by the
Participant during his, her or its employment by or association with the
Company, by accepting an Award, the Participant assigns (without royalty or
other compensation) all right, title and interest therein, in perpetuity and
throughout the world, to the Company. The Participant agrees to execute,
immediately upon the Companys reasonable request and without charge, any
further assignments, applications, conveyances or other instruments, at any
time, whether or not the Participant is employed by or associated with the
Company at the time such request is made, in order to permit the Company
and/or its respective assigns to protect, perfect, register, record, maintain,
or enhance their rights in any Intellectual Property Product; provided, that,
the Company shall bear the cost of any such

 assignments, applications or consequences. Upon termination of the
Participants employment by or association with the Company for any reason
whatsoever, and at any earlier time the Company so requests, the Participant
will immediately deliver to the custody of the person designated by the
Company all originals and copies of any documents and other property of the
Company in the Participants possession, under the Participants control or
to which he or she may have access.

For purposes of this Section 15, the term "Company" shall include the Company
and its Affiliates.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein or in an Award Agreement to the contrary,
the provisions of this Section 15 are meant to apply in addition to, and not
in lieu of, any restrictive covenants to which a Participant may be subject.

 

16\. _General_.

(a) _Award Agreements_. Each Award under this Plan shall be evidenced by an
Award agreement, which shall be delivered to the Participant (whether in paper
or electronic medium (including email or the posting on a web site maintained
by the Company or a third party under contract with the Company)) and shall
specify the terms and conditions of the Award and any rules applicable
thereto, including without limitation, the effect on such Award of the death,
disability or termination of employment or service of a Participant, or of
such other events as may be determined by the Committee.

(b) _Nontransferability_.

(i) Each Award shall be exercisable only by a Participant during the
Participants lifetime, or, if permissible under applicable law, by the
Participants legal guardian or representative. No Award may be assigned,
alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by
a Participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution
and any such purported assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale,
transfer or encumbrance shall be void and unenforceable against the Company
or an Affiliate; provided that the designation of a beneficiary shall not
constitute an assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or
encumbrance.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, in its sole discretion,
permit Awards (other than Incentive Stock Options) to be transferred by a
Participant, without consideration, subject to such rules as the Committee may
adopt consistent with any applicable Award agreement to preserve the purposes
of this Plan, to: (A) any person who is a "family member" of the Participant,
as such term is used in the instructions to Form S-8 under the Securities Act
(collectively, the "Immediate Family Members"); (B) a trust solely for the
benefit of the Participant and his or her Immediate Family Members; or (C) a
partnership or limited liability company whose only partners or stockholders
are the Participant and his or her Immediate Family Members; or (D) any other
transferee as may be approved either (I) by the Board or the Committee in its
sole discretion, or (II) as provided in the applicable Award agreement (each
transferee described in clauses (A), (B) (C) and (D) above is hereinafter
referred to as a "Permitted Transferee"); _provided_ , that the Participant
gives the Committee advance written notice describing the terms and conditions
of the proposed transfer and the Committee notifies the Participant in writing
that such a transfer would comply with the requirements of this Plan.

(iii) The terms of any Award transferred in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence shall apply to the Permitted Transferee and any reference
in this Plan, or in any applicable Award agreement, to a Participant shall be
deemed to refer to the Permitted Transferee, except that (A)
Permitted Transferees shall not be entitled to transfer any Award, other than
by will or the laws of descent and distribution; (B) Permitted Transferees
shall not be entitled to exercise any transferred Option unless there shall be
in effect a registration statement on an appropriate form covering the Common
Shares to be acquired pursuant to the exercise of such Option if the Committee
determines, consistent with any applicable Award agreement, that such a
registration statement is necessary or appropriate; (C) the Committee or the
Company shall not be required to provide any notice to a Permitted Transferee,
whether or not such notice is or would otherwise have been required to be
given 

 



17 ##### Table of Contents

  

 to the Participant under this Plan or otherwise; and (D) the consequences of
the termination of the Participants employment by, or services to, the
Company or an Affiliate under the terms of this Plan and the applicable Award
agreement shall continue to be applied with respect to the Participant,
including, without limitation, that an Option shall be exercisable by the
Permitted Transferee only to the extent, and for the periods, specified in
this Plan and the applicable Award agreement.

(c) _Tax Withholding_. 

(i) A Participant shall be required to pay to the Company or any Affiliate,
and the Company or any Affiliate shall have the right and is hereby
authorized to withhold, from any cash, Common Shares, other securities or
other property deliverable under any Award or from any compensation or other
amounts owing to a Participant, the amount (in cash, Common Shares, other
securities or other property) of any required withholding taxes in respect of
an Award, its exercise, or any payment or transfer under an Award or under
this Plan and to lake such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of
the Committee or the Company to satisfy all obligations for the payment of
such withholding and taxes.

(ii) Without limiting the generality of clause (i) above, the Committee may,
in its sole discretion, permit a Participant to satisfy, in whole or in part,
the foregoing withholding liability by (A) the delivery of Common Shares
(which are not subject lo any pledge or other security interest and are
Mature Shares) owned by the Participant having a Fair Market Value equal to
such withholding liability or (B) having the Company withhold from the number
of Common Shares otherwise issuable or deliverable pursuant to the exercise
or settlement of the Award a number of Common Shares with a Fair Market Value
equal to such withholding liability (but no more than the minimum required
statutory withholding liability).

 

(d) _No Claim to Awards; No Rights to Continued Employment; Waiver_. No
employee of the Company or an Affiliate, or other person, shall have any
claim or right to be granted an Award under this Plan or, having been selected
for the grant of an Award, to be selected for a grant of any other Award.
There is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants or holders
or beneficiaries of Awards. The terms and conditions of Awards and the
Committees determinations and interpretations with respect thereto need not
be the same with respect to each Participant and may be made
selectively among Participants, whether or not such Participants are
similarly situated. Neither this Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be
construed as giving any Participant any right to be retained in the employ or
service of the Company or an Affiliate, nor shall it be construed as giving
any Participant any rights to continued service on the Board. The Company or
any of its Affiliates may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment or
discontinue any consulting relationship, free from any liability or any claim
under this Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in this Plan or any Award
agreement. By accepting an Award under this Plan, a Participant shall thereby
be deemed to have waived any claim to continued exercise or vesting of an
Award or to damages or severance entitlement related to non-continuation of
the Award beyond the period provided under this Plan or any Award agreement,
notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any written employment
contract or other agreement between the Company and its Affiliates and the
Participant, whether any such agreement is executed before, on or after the
Date of Grant.

(e) _International Participants_. With respect to Participants who reside or
work outside of the United States of America and who are not (and who are not
expected to be) "covered employees" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of
the Code, the Committee may in its sole discretion amend the terms of this
Plan or outstanding Awards (or establish a sub-plan) with respect to such
Participants in order to conform such terms with the requirements of local
law or to obtain more favorable tax or other treatment for a Participant, the
Company or its Affiliates.

(f) _Designation and Change of Beneficiary_. Each Participant may file with
the Committee a written designation of one or more persons as the
beneficiary(ies) who shall be entitled to receive the amounts payable with
respect to an Award, if any, due under this Plan upon his death. A Participant
may, from time to time, revoke or change his beneficiary designation without
the consent of any prior beneficiary by filing a 

 



18 ##### Table of Contents

  

 new designation with the Committee. The last such designation received by
the Committee shall be controlling; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
designation, or change or revocation thereof, shall be effective unless
received by the Committee prior to the Participants death, and in no event
shall it be effective as of a date prior to such receipt. If no beneficiary
designation is filed by a Participant, the beneficiary shall be deemed to be
his or her spouse or, if the Participant is unmarried at the time of death,
his or her estate.

(g) _Termination of Employment/Service_. Unless determined otherwise by the
Committee at any point following such event:

 

(i) For purposes of Incentive Stock Options, neither a temporary absence from
employment due to illness, vacation or an approved leave of absence for
military service or for any other purpose approved by the Company, if the
period of such leave does not exceed three months or, if longer, the
employees right to re-employment is guaranteed either by a statute or by
contract, nor a transfer from employment with the Company to employment with a
Related Company (or vice-versa) shall be considered a termination of
employment with the Company or a Related Company; and

 

(ii) For purposes of Awards other than Incentive Stock Options, (A) neither a
temporary absence from employment or service due to illness, vacation or
leave of absence nor a transfer from employment or service with the Company to
employment or service with an Affiliate (or vice-versa) shall be considered a
termination of employment or service with the Company or an Affiliate; and
(B) if a Participants employment with the Company and its Affiliates
terminates, but such Participant continues to provide services to the Company
and its Affiliates in a non-employee capacity (or vice-versa), such change in
status shall not be considered a termination of employment with the Company or
an Affiliate.

(h)  _No Rights as a Stockholder_. Except as otherwise specifically provided
in this Plan or any Award agreement, no person shall be entitled to the
privileges of ownership in respect of Common Shares that are subject to Awards
hereunder until such Common Shares have been issued or delivered to that
person.

(i) _Government and Other Regulations_.

(i) The obligation of the Company to settle Awards in Common Shares or
other consideration shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and
regulations, and to such approvals by governmental agencies as may be
required. Notwithstanding any terms or conditions of any Award to the
contrary, the Company shall be under no obligation to offer to sell or to
sell, and shall be prohibited from offering to sell or selling, any Common
Shares pursuant to an Award unless such shares have been properly registered
for sale pursuant to the Securities Act with the Securities and Exchange
Commission or unless the Company has received an opinion of counsel,
satisfactory to the Company, that such shares may be offered or sold without
such registration pursuant to an available exemption therefrom and the terms
and conditions of such exemption have been fully complied with. The Company
shall be under no obligation to register for sale under the Securities Act any
of the Common Shares to be offered or sold under this Plan. The Committee
shall have the authority to provide that all certificates for Common Shares
or other securities of the Company or any Affiliate delivered under this Plan
shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the
Committee may deem advisable under this Plan, the applicable Award agreement,
the federal securities laws, or the rules, regulations and other requirements
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any securities exchange or inter-
dealer quotation system upon which such shares or other securities are then
listed or quoted and any other applicable federal, state, local or non-U.S.
laws, and, without limiting the generality of Section 9 of this Plan, the
Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to
make appropriate reference to such restrictions. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Plan to the contrary, the Committee reserves the right to
add any additional terms or provisions to any Award granted under this Plan
that it in its sole discretion deems necessary or advisable in order that
such Award complies with the legal requirements of any governmental entity lo
whose jurisdiction the Award is subject.

 

(ii) The Committee may cancel an Award or any portion thereof if it
determines, in its sole discretion, that legal or contractual restrictions
and/or blockage and/or other market considerations

 



19 ##### Table of Contents

  

 would make the Companys acquisition of Common Shares from the public
markets, the Companys issuance of Common Shares to the Participant, the
Participants acquisition of Common Shares from the Company and/or the
Participants sale of Common Shares to the public markets, illegal,
impracticable or inadvisable. If the Committee determines to cancel all or any
portion of an Award in accordance with the foregoing, the Company shall pay
to the Participant an amount equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate Fair
Market Value of the Common Shares subject to such Award or portion thereof
canceled (determined as of the applicable exercise date, or the date that the
Common Shares would have been vested or delivered, as applicable), over (B)
the aggregate Exercise Price or Strike Price (in the case of an Option or SAR,
respectively) or any amount payable as a condition of delivery of Common
Shares (in the case of any other Award). Such amount shall be delivered to
the Participant as soon as practicable following the cancellation of such
Award or portion thereof.

 

(j) _Payments to Persons Other Than Participants_. If the Committee shall find
that any person to whom any amount is payable under this Plan is unable to
care for his affairs because of illness or accident, or is a minor, or has
died, then any payment due to such person or his estate (unless a prior claim
therefor has been made by a duly appointed legal representative) may, if the
Committee so directs the Company, be paid to his spouse, child, relative, an
institution maintaining or having custody of such person, or any other person
deemed by the Committee to be a proper recipient on behalf of such person
otherwise entitled to payment. Any such payment shall be a complete discharge
of the liability of the Committee and the Company therefor.

(k) _Nonexclusivity of this Plan_. Neither the adoption of this Plan by the
Board nor the submission of this Plan to the stockholders of the Company for
approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the
Board to adopt such other incentive arrangements as it may deem desirable,
including, without limitation, the granting of stock options or other equity-
based awards otherwise than under this Plan, and such arrangements may be
either applicable generally or only in specific cases.

(l) _No Trust or Fund Created_. Neither this Plan nor any Award shall create
or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary
relationship between the Company or any Affiliate, on the one hand, and a
Participant or other person or entity, on the other hand. No provision of
this Plan or any Award shall require the Company, for the purpose of
satisfying any obligations under this Plan, to purchase assets or place any
assets in a trust or other entity to which contributions are made or
otherwise to segregate any assets, nor shall the Company maintain separate
bank accounts, books, records or other evidence of the existence of a
segregated or separately maintained or administered fund for such purposes.
Participants shall have no rights under this Plan other than as general
unsecured creditors of the Company, except that insofar as they may have
become entitled to payment of additional compensation by performance of
services, they shall have the same rights as other employees under general
law.

(m) _Reliance on Reports_. Each member of the Committee and each member of
the Board shall be fully justified in acting or failing to act, as the case
may be, and shall not be liable for having so acted or failed to act in good
faith, in reliance upon any report made by the independent public accountant
of the Company and its Affiliates and/or any other information furnished in
connection with this Plan by any agent of the Company or the Committee or the
Board, other than himself.

 

(n) _Relationship to Other Benefits_. No payment under this Plan shall be
taken into account in determining any benefits under any pension, retirement,
profit sharing, group insurance or other benefit plan of the Company except as
otherwise specifically provided in such other plan.

 

(o) _Governing Law_. The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the internal laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the
conflict of laws provisions.

(p) _Severability_. If any provision of this Plan or any Award or Award
agreement is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable
in any jurisdiction or as to any person or entity or Award, or would
disqualify this Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the
Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to
the applicable laws, or if it cannot be

 



20 ##### Table of Contents

  

 construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee,
materially altering the intent of this Plan or the Award, such provision shall
be construed or deemed stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or entity or
Award and the remainder of this Plan and any such Award shall remain in full
force and effect.

(q) _Obligations Binding on Successors_. The obligations of the Company under
this Plan shall be binding upon any successor corporation or organization
resulting from the merger, amalgamation, consolidation or other
reorganization of the Company, or upon any successor corporation or
organization succeeding to substantially all of the assets and business of the
Company.

 

(r) _Code Section 162(m) Approval_. If so determined by the Committee, the
provisions of this Plan regarding Performance Compensation Awards shall be
disclosed and reapproved by stockholders no later than the first stockholder
meeting that occurs in the fifth year following the year in which stockholders
previously approved such provisions, in each case in order for certain Awards
granted after such time to be exempt from the deduction limitations of Section
162(m) of the Code. Nothing in this clause, however, shall affect the validity
of Awards granted after such time if such stockholder approval has not been
obtained.

(s) _Expenses; Gender; Titles and Headings_. The expenses of administering
this Plan shall be borne by the Company and its Affiliates. Masculine pronouns
and other words of masculine gender shall refer to both men and women. The
titles and headings of the sections in this Plan are for convenience of
reference only, and in the event of any conflict, the text of this Plan,
rather than such titles or headings shall control.

(t) _Other Agreements_. Notwithstanding the above, the Committee may require,
as a condition to the grant of and/or the receipt of Common Shares under an
Award, that the Participant execute lock-up, stockholder or other agreements,
as it may determine in its sole and absolute discretion.

(u)  _Section 409A_. The Plan and all Awards granted hereunder are intended
to comply with, or otherwise be exempt from, Section 409A of the Code. The
Plan and all Awards granted under this Plan shall be administered,
interpreted, and construed in a manner consistent with Section 409A of the
Code to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of additional taxes under
Section 409A(a)(l)(B) of the Code. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to
the contrary, in no event shall the Committee exercise its discretion to
accelerate the payment or settlement of an Award where such payment or
settlement constitutes deferred compensation within the meaning of Section
409A of the Code unless, and solely to the extent that, such accelerated
payment or settlement is permissible under Treasury Regulation section
1.409A-3(j)(4) or any successor provision.

(v) _Payments_. Participants shall be required to pay, to the extent required
by applicable law, any amounts required to receive Common Shares under any
Award made under this Plan.

 

17\. _Limitation on Liability_. The Company and any Affiliate that is in
existence or that hereinafter comes into existence will have no liability to
any Participant or any other person as to (a) the non-issuance or sale of
Common Shares as to which the Company has been unable to obtain from any
regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority deemed by counsel to the
Company necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Common Shares
hereunder; (b) any tax consequences expected, but not realized, by a
Participant or any other person due to the receipt, exercise, or settlement of
any Award granted hereunder; or (3) the failure of any Award that is
determined to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" to comply with
Section 409A of the Code.

vested in the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board of
Directors") by the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the
Corporation (as so amended and as further amended from time to time in
accordance with its terms, this Certificate of Designation and the
General Corporation Law, the "Certificate of Incorporation") which authorizes
the issuance, by the Corporation, in one or more series of up to 1,000,000

the General Corporation Law, the Board of Directors, by unanimous written
consent dated  , 2012, duly adopted the following
resolution:

RESOLVED, that, pursuant to the authority expressly granted to and vested in
the Board of Directors by the provisions of Article Fourth of the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Corporation and in accordance with the provisions of
Section 151 of the General Corporation Law, the Board of Directors hereby
creates and provides for the issuance of a series of Preferred Stock, herein
designated as the Series A Voting Preferred Stock, which shall consist
initially of 600,000 shares of Preferred Stock (subject to increase or
decrease as described herein in accordance with Section 151(g) of the General
Corporation Law), and the powers, designations, preferences and
relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and the
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of the shares of such
series (in addition to the powers, designations, preferences and relative,
participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereof, set forth in the Certificate of
Incorporation that are applicable to Preferred Stock of all series) are hereby
fixed as follows:

 

1\. _General_.

(a) The shares of such series shall be designated the Series A Voting
Preferred Stock (hereinafter referred to as the "Series A Voting Preferred
Stock").

 

(b) Each share of Series A Voting Preferred Stock shall be identical in all
respects with the other shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock.

(c) The number of shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock shall initially be
600,000, which number may from time to time be increased (but not above the
total number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock and subject to Section
6(b)) or decreased (but not below the number of shares of Series A Voting
Preferred Stock then outstanding or issuable, pursuant to the terms of that
certain Cross Purchase Agreement by and among the Corporation and Paperweight
Development Corp. ("PDC"), (as amended from time to time in accordance with
its terms, the "Cross Purchase Agreement"). 

(d) The Corporation shall be required to issue fractions of a share of the
Series A Voting Preferred Stock and shall not (i) arrange for the disposition
of fractional interests, (ii) pay in cash the fair value of fractions of a
share or (iii) issue scrip or warrants therefor; and in each case so long as
the Series A Voting Preferred Stock remains outstanding, fractional shares of
Series A Voting Preferred Stock shall be issued, _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Corporation shall not be required to issue fractional shares of Series A
Voting Preferred Stock in increments  ##### Table of Contents

  

 less than 1/20th of a share (subject to equitable adjustment to the extent
the Preferred Stock Voting Multiple is equitably adjusted), and any amount
less than 1/20th of a share (subject to equitable adjustment to the extent
the Preferred Stock Voting Multiple is equitably adjusted) of Series A Voting
Preferred Stock shall result in the Corporation paying to the holder in cash
the fair value of such fractional share, such fair value based off a value of
$0.0001 per full share.

(e) In any case where any dividend payment date or redemption date shall not
be a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this
Certificate of Designation) payment of dividends or redemption price need not
be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with
the same force and effect as if made on the dividend payment date or
redemption date, provided, however, that in such circumstance no interest
shall accrue on such amount of dividends or redemption price for the period
from and after such dividend payment date or redemption date, as the case may
be. For the purposes of this Certificate of Designation, "Business Day" shall
mean each day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which banking
institutions in New York, New York are authorized or required by law to
close. 

2\. _Dividends and Distributions_. Except as expressly provided in Section 3
and Section 7 below, the holders of Series A Voting Preferred Stock shall not
be entitled to receive any dividends or distributions in respect of any shares
of Series A Voting Preferred Stock held by them.

 

3\. _Liquidation_.

(a) In the event of a liquidation (complete or partial), dissolution or
winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary
(a "Liquidation "), after payment or provision for payment of the debts and
other liabilities of the Corporation, the holders of Series A Voting Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to receive, in respect of any shares of Series A
Voting Preferred Stock held by them, out of assets of the Corporation
available for distribution to stockholders of the Corporation, and subject to
the rights of any stock of the Corporation ranking senior to or on parity with
the Series A Voting Preferred Stock in respect of a Liquidation and before
any amount shall be distributed among the holders of common stock of the
Corporation, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Common Stock"), or any other
shares ranking junior to the Series A Voting Preferred Stock in respect of
a Liquidation, a liquidating distribution in the amount of $0.0001 per share,
and no more (the "Liquidation Payment"). If, upon a Liquidation, the assets of
the Corporation, or proceeds thereof, distributable among the holders of
the then outstanding shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock and the
holders of any shares of capital stock ranking on a parity with the Series A
Preferred Stock with respect to any distribution of assets upon Liquidation
are insufficient to pay in full all such preferential amounts payable with
respect to Series A Voting Preferred Stock and any other stock ranking as to
any such distribution on parity with the Series A Voting Preferred Stock, the
holders of Series A Voting Preferred Stock and such other stock shall share
ratably in any distribution of assets in proportion to the full respective
preferential amounts to which they are entitled.

(b) The Corporation shall provide the holders of Series A Voting Preferred
Stock appearing on the stock books of the Corporation as of the date of such
notice at the address of said holder shown therein with written notice of (i)
any voluntary Liquidation promptly after such Liquidation has been approved by
the Board of Directors and (ii) any involuntary Liquidation promptly upon the
Corporation becoming aware of any threatened or instituted proceeding in
respect thereof. Such notice shall state a distribution or payment date, the
amount of the Liquidation Payment and the place where the Liquidation Payment
shall be distributable or payable.

 

(c) For the purposes of this Section 3, neither the voluntary sale, lease,
conveyance, exchange or transfer of all or substantially all the property or
assets of the Corporation (whether for cash, shares of stock, securities or
other consideration), nor the consolidation or merger of the Corporation with
one or more other entities, shall be deemed to be a Liquidation of
the Corporation, unless such voluntary sale, lease, conveyance, exchange,
merger, consolidation or transfer shall be in connection with a plan of
liquidation (complete or partial), dissolution or winding up of the affairs of
the Corporation.

(d) After the payment in cash to the holders of shares of the Series A Voting
Preferred Stock of the full amount of the Liquidation Payment with respect to
outstanding shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock, the holders of
outstanding shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock shall have no right or
claim, based on their ownership of shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock,
to the remaining assets of the Corporation, if any.

4\. _Reacquired Shares; Redemption; Exchange_.

(a) If shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock are purchased, redeemed or
otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever, then the
Series A Voting Preferred Stock so acquired shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, be retired and canceled upon the purchase, redemption or
acquisition thereof and shall not be reissued as shares of Series A Voting
Preferred Stock.

(b) Such shares shall, upon their retirement and cancellation, and upon
the taking of any action required by applicable law, revert to authorized but
unissued shares of Preferred Stock undesignated as to series and may be
reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by
resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject to the
conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth in the Certificate of
Incorporation and applicable law.

(c) One Class B Exchangeable Unit (a "Class B Exchangeable Unit") of Appleton
Papers LLC (f/k/a/ Appleton Papers Inc.) ("Appleton") may, at any time or
from time to time, be exchanged by the holder thereof for one share of Common
Stock, in accordance with that certain Exchange and Support Agreement, dated 
, 2012 (as amended from time to time in accordance with its terms, the
"Exchange and Support Agreement"), by and among the Corporation, Appleton and
PDC, and the Limited Liability Company Agreement of Appleton (as amended from
time to time in accordance with its terms, the "Appleton LLC Agreement"),
subject to adjustment as provided for therein. Upon the exchange of any Class
B Exchangeable Units by the holder thereof for shares of Common Stock pursuant
to the Exchange and Support Agreement, a number of shares of Series A Voting
Preferred Stock equal to the quotient of (i) one over (ii) the Preferred
Stock Voting Multiple (as defined below) held by such holder for every one

the authorized number of shares of its Common Stock and/or Series A Voting

this Certificate of Designation, holders of Series A Voting Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the
stockholders of the Corporation, voting together with the holders of Common
Stock as a single class. In any such vote in which holders of Series A Voting
Preferred shall vote together with the holders of Common Stock as a single

entitled to cast twenty (20) votes for each share of Series A Voting Preferred
Stock held by such holder on the record date for determining the stockholders
of the Corporation entitled to vote, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section
7 of this Certificate of Designation (the "Preferred Stock Voting Multiple").
The calculation of the Preferred Stock Voting Multiple shall take into
account fractions of a share of the Series A Voting Preferred Stock of amounts
equal to or greater than 1/20th of a share. Unless otherwise provided by any
applicable provision of law, at each meeting of holders of Series A
Voting Preferred Stock, at which such holders are voting separately and
exclusively as a series, each holder of record of shares of Series A Voting
Preferred Stock entitled to vote shall be entitled to vote in person or by
proxy, and each such holder shall be entitled to cast a number of votes equal
to the Preferred Stock Voting Multiple for each share of Series A Voting
Preferred Stock held by such holder on the record date for determining the
stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote, if a quorum is present.
Except as set forth in this Section 6 or otherwise provided by the General
Corporation Law, the holders of Series A Voting Preferred Stock shall have no
special voting rights and their consent shall not be required for taking any
corporate action.

Certificate of Incorporation or by applicable law, for so long as any of the
shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock shall remain outstanding, the

consolidation or otherwise, do any of the following without (in addition to
any other vote required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation) the

writing or by vote at a meeting, consenting or voting (as the case may be),
separately and exclusively as a series, to:

(i) adopt any alteration, amendment or repeal of any provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation (including any such alteration, amendment or
repeal effected by any merger or consolidation) that effects a division,
subdivision, consolidation or combination of shares of Common Stock or
increases the per share voting power of the Common Stock, unless such
alteration, amendment or repeal also proportionately divides, subdivides,
consolidates or combines shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock on the
same basis and does not alter or change the voting preferences or power of the
Series A Voting Preferred Stock relative to the Common Stock so as to affect
the holders of Series A Voting Preferred Stock adversely;

(ii) declare any dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than
in connection with a Liquidation) in shares of Common Stock, Preferred Stock
or securities convertible, exercisable, or exchangeable for Common Stock or
Preferred Stock, unless a proportionate dividend or distribution of shares of
Series A Voting Preferred Stock is also declared on the Series A Voting
Preferred Stock such that the voting preferences and powers of the Series A
Voting Preferred Stock relative to the Common Stock are not adversely
affected;

 



4 ##### Table of Contents

  

(iii) except in connection with a division or subdivision pursuant to clause
(i) above, divide or subdivide (by stock split, stock dividend or other
distribution, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) the Series A
Voting Preferred Stock into a greater number of shares or combine or
consolidate (by reverse stock split, reclassification, recapitalization or
otherwise) the Series A Voting Preferred Stock;

 

(iv) list any shares of its capital stock on a securities exchange or trading
market whose listing rules would require an alteration or change to the
voting power of the Series A Voting Preferred Stock; or

(v) amend, alter or repeal any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation
or Bylaws of the Corporation in a manner that adversely affects the powers,
preferences or rights of the Series A Voting Preferred Stock.

In the event the Corporation shall propose to take any action enumerated in
this Section 6(b) above then, and in each such case, the Corporation shall
cause to be filed with the transfer agent(s) for the Series A Voting
Preferred Stock and shall give notice of such proposed action to each holder
of record of the shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock appearing on the
stock books of the Corporation as of the date of such notice at the
address of said holder shown therein. Such notice shall specify, _inter alia_
(v) the effective date of such adoption of any alteration, amendment or repeal
of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation; (w) the date on which a
record is to be taken for the purposes of such dividend or distribution; (x)
the date on which division or subdivision is to take place; and/or (y) the
date on which shares of capital stock are anticipated to be listed on a
securities exchange or trading market, as applicable; and (z) the other
material teams of such action. Such notice shall be given at least 20 Business
Days prior to the applicable date or effective date specified above. If at any
time the Corporation shall cancel any of the proposed transactions for which
notice has been given under this Section 6(b) prior to the consummation
thereof, the Corporation shall give prompt notice of such cancellation to each
holder of record of the shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock appearing
on the stock books of the Corporation as of the date of such notice at the
address of said holder shown therein.

7\. _Organic Changes_.

(a) If there is: (1) any division or subdivision (by split, distribution,
reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination or
consolidation (by reverse split, reclassification, recapitalization or
otherwise) of the Class B Exchangeable Units, the Corporation shall cause it
to be accompanied by an identical proportionate division, subdivision,
consolidation or combination of the Common Stock; or (2) any division or
subdivision (by split, distribution, reclassification, recapitalization or
otherwise) or combination or consolidation (by reverse split,
reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) of the Common Stock, the
Corporation and Appleton shall cause it to be accompanied by an identical
proportionate division, subdivision, consolidation or combination of the
Class B Exchangeable Units. Furthermore any such event shall be accompanied by
either (i) an identical proportionate division, subdivision, consolidation or
combination of the Series A Voting Preferred Stock or (ii) an equitable
proportionate adjustment of the Preferred Stock Voting Multiple, in either
case to ensure such event does not adversely affect or disproportionately
increase the voting power of the Series A Voting Preferred Stock or
the holders ability to transfer or exchange such stock.

(b) In the event of any merger, acquisition, reorganization, consolidation,
or liquidation of the Corporation or any reclassification or other similar
transaction as a result of which the shares of Common Stock are converted into
another security involving a payment or distribution of cash, securities
or other assets to the holders of Common Stock in which the Class B
Exchangeable Units remain outstanding (a "Fundamental Transaction"), the
Series A Voting Preferred Stock shall remain outstanding and the exchange
provisions of the Exchange and Support Agreement shall thereafter permit the
exchange of Class B Exchangeable Units for the amount of such cash, securities
or other assets which a holder of Class B Exchangeable Units would have
received had it made an exchange for Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange
and Support Agreement immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction,
regardless of whether such exchange would actually have been permitted at such
time.

 shall issue or cause to be issued a replacement certificate representing
that number of Appleton Class B Exchangeable Units or shares of Parent Series
A Voting Preferred Stock remaining after giving effect to the Exchange
Notice, issued in the name of the Exchanging Member and to deliver such
replacement certificate as provided in the Exchange Notice.

Section 2.5 _Effect on Appleton Class B Exchangeable Units and Parent Series A
Voting Preferred Stock Surrendered_. Upon the delivery to the Designated
Recipient(s) of the Reciprocate Common Stock on the relevant Exchange Date in
connection with an exchange contemplated by an Exchange Notice which has not
been revoked, subject to the provisions of Section 2.4, the Exchanging Member
shall cease to be a holder of the portion of such Parent Series A Voting
Preferred Stock and Appleton Class B Exchangeable Units being surrendered for
exchange and shall have no further rights whatsoever with respect to such
securities. Following receipt by the Designated Recipient(s) of the
Reciprocate Common Stock, and provided there has been no revocation of the
applicable Exchange Notice by the Exchanging Member in advance of such
receipt, subject to the provisions of Section 2.4, the surrendered Appleton
Class B Exchangeable Units shall be deemed cancelled by the Company and shares
of Parent Series A Voting Preferred Stock shall be automatically redeemed by
Parent in accordance with the Certificate of Designation. For the avoidance
of doubt, the completion of an automatic redemption of the aforementioned
Parent Series A Voting Preferred Stock shall not be a condition to the
issuance and delivery of the Reciprocate Common Stock.

 

Section 2.6 _Take-Overs, Mergers and Registrations_. Parent and the Company
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to expeditiously and in good
faith provide holders of Appleton Class B Exchangeable Units with sufficient
notice so that such holders may participate by exercising their rights under
Section 2.2(a) in any take-over bid, merger, consolidation, share exchange
offer, third party or issuer tender offer, arrangement or similar transaction
or Registration Statement involving the Common Stock and, to facilitate
participation in any such transaction or Registration Statement, to adopt
reasonable modifications (following good faith consultation with the
Exchanging Members) to the exchange procedures set forth in this Agreement so
that any exercise required in respect thereof shall be effective only upon,
and shall be conditional upon, the closing of such transaction or
effectiveness of such Registration Statement.

 Section 2.7 _Limitations_

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall
not be required to issue Reciprocate Common Stock in accordance with this
Section 2.7 and Section 2.2 at any time that such issuance would result in an
Exchanging Member becoming the record owner of 20% or more of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the sum of
the Class B Exchangeable Units exchanged pursuant to Section 2.1 during any
fiscal year of the Company shall not exceed 25% of the total interests in the
Companys capital or profits.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
may, in lieu of exchanging Reciprocate Common Stock in accordance with this
Article II, elect to pay the Exchanging Member in cash the Trading Price (as
defined in the Equity Purchase Agreement) of the Reciprocate Common Stock at
the time such Reciprocate Common Stock would otherwise be issued to the
Exchanging Member in accordance with this Article II; provided that the
Company shall pay the Exchanging Member in cash in accordance with this
Section 2.7 if Parent fails to comply or is otherwise prohibited from
exchanging Reciprocate Common Stock in accordance with this Article II.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, an Exchanging
Member shall not be entitled to exchange Class B Exchangeable Units, and the
Company shall have the right to refuse to honor any request for exchange of
any Class B Exchangeable Units, if such exchange would (i) be prohibited
under any applicable law or regulation or (ii) cause the Company to be
classified as a "publicly traded partnership" as such term is defined in
Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations

Exchanging Members and the Company. 

Section 2.8 _Purchase Option_. In the event that the number of Appleton Class
B Exchangeable Units owned by PDC is less than three percent (3%) of the
Common Stock (after giving pro forma effect to the exchange of such Units),
then Parent shall have the right upon written notice to the Company to
purchase all of the remaining Appleton Class B Exchangeable Units then owned
by PDC in exchange for the issuance of Parent of Reciprocate Common Stock as
if PDC elected to exchange such Units in accordance with this Article II.

 

ARTICLE III

contributions hereunder shall be made free and clear of any and all present
or future transfer Taxes and all liabilities with respect thereto. Each party
shall pay any and all transfer Taxes that he, she or it is required to pay

Section 4.2 _No Effect on Agreement_. Except as provided in this Agreement or
otherwise agreed to by the parties hereto in writing, the obligations of
Parent under this Agreement shall not be altered, limited, impaired or
otherwise affected by:

(a) any modification or amendment, in whole or in part, of the terms of the

evidencing or relating to any of the foregoing, except to the extent adopted

Company, including any such change by reason of any merger or consideration or
any sale, transfer, issuance, spin-off, distribution or other disposition of

(f) any other act or omission that may or might otherwise operate as a
discharge of Parent as a matter of law or equity, other than the performance
of the Obligation and this Agreement.

Section 4.3 _Continuing Agreement_. This Agreement shall be construed as a
continuing, absolute and unconditional, subject to the compliance by the
parties with the requirements and procedures set forth herein, agreement to
issue Reciprocate Common Stock (or other property as provided herein) and a
guarantee of performance of the Obligation and shall not be conditioned or
contingent upon the pursuit by Exchanging Members at any time of any right or

Section 4.4 _Reservation of Shares_. Parent shall, and shall authorize and
direct the Transfer Agent and any other current or future transfer agents for
the Common Stock and/or the Parent Series A Voting Preferred Stock to, at all
times while Appleton Class B Exchangeable Units are outstanding or are
issuable (whether such obligation is absolute or contingent) pursuant to this
Agreement, the Equity Purchase Agreement, the Certificate of Designation
and/or the Appleton LLC Agreement, reserve and keep available, from its
authorized and unissued capital stock, sufficient shares of Common Stock and
Parent Series A Voting Preferred Stock solely for issuance and delivery as and
when required under this Agreement and/or such other agreements. Parent shall,
from time to time, take any and all steps necessary to increase the
authorized number of shares of Common Stock if, at any time, the authorized
number of shares of Common Stock remaining unissued would otherwise be
insufficient to allow delivery of all the shares of Common Stock then
deliverable upon the exchange in full of all outstanding Class B Exchangeable
Units outstanding (whether such obligation is absolute or contingent) pursuant
to the Agreement and/or Appleton LLC Agreement. Parent will supply such
Transfer Agents with duly executed stock certificates for such purposes as
necessary to comply with its obligations under this Agreement.

Section 4.5 _Reports to Holders_. So long as any shares of Parent Series A
Voting Preferred Stock remain outstanding, if Parent is not required to
file information, documents or reports pursuant to either of Section 13 or
Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"),
Parent shall cause quarterly reports (containing unaudited
financial statements) for the first three quarters of each fiscal year and
annual reports (containing audited financial statements and an opinion thereon
by Parents independent certified public accountants) which the Parent would
be required to file under Section 13 of the Exchange Act if it had a class of
securities listed on a national securities exchange to be mailed to each
holder of record of the shares of Parent Series A Voting Preferred Stock
appearing on the stock books of Parent as of the date of such mailing at the
address of said holder shown therein within 15 days after the date when such
report would have been required to be filed under Section 13 of the Exchange
Act for a non-accelerated filer.

 

Section 4.6 _Restrictions on Parent_.

 

(a) Parent may not directly or indirectly acquire, whether by merger,
reorganization, consolidation, purchase, or otherwise, any business, material
assets or securities (other than securities of the Parent and the Company)
unless, following such transaction, such business, material assets or
securities (other than securities of the Parent and the Company) are owned by
the Company or a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

(b) Except as provided in the Appleton LLC Agreement, neither Parent nor any
subsidiary of Parent, other than the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries, shall own any assets or securities (other than Company
securities, a _de minimis_ amount of cash or other temporary investments
or those amounts necessary or incidental to the operation of Parents
business as the public holding company of the Company or to the duties of
Parent contemplated by this Agreement or the Appleton LLC Agreement) or
operate any business (other than the holding of the securities of the
Company, acting as an issuer of publicly traded securities or activities
incidental thereto).

(c) Parent may not issue shares of Parent Series A Voting Preferred Stock to
any Person other than the Exchanging Members or pursuant to the Cross Purchase
Agreement.

 

Section 4.7 _Dilutive Actions; Issuances; Fundamental Transactions_.

 

(a) If there is: (1) any division or subdivision (by split, distribution,
reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization or otherwise) or
combination or consolidation (by reverse split, reclassification,
recapitalization, reorganization or otherwise) of the Appleton Class B
Exchangeable Units, Parent shall cause it to be accompanied by an
identical proportionate division, subdivision, consolidation or combination
of the Common Stock; or (2) any division or subdivision (by split,
distribution, reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization or otherwise)
or combination or consolidation (by reverse split, reclassification,
recapitalization, reorganization or otherwise) of the Common Stock, Parent and
the Company shall cause it to be accompanied by an identical proportionate
division, subdivision, consolidation or combination of the Appleton Class B
Exchangeable Units; and, in either case, such event shall be

 



9 ##### Table of Contents

  

 accompanied by either (i) an identical proportionate division, subdivision,
consolidation or combination of the Series A Voting Preferred Stock or (ii) an
equitable proportionate adjustment of the Preferred Stock Voting Multiple.

(b) In the event that Parent issues any shares of Common Stock (other than
pursuant to the terms herein), including in respect of options, warrants or
other convertible securities, it shall immediately contribute the proceeds of
such issuance, exercise or conversion to the Company in exchange for a
number of Appleton Class A Voting Units equal to the number of shares of
Common Stock so issued.

(c) Except for issuances of Contingency Consideration as expressly
contemplated by the Cross Purchase Agreement, in the event that Parent issues
any securities other than shares of Common Stock, including convertible debt
securities, preferred stock, options, warrants, or other securities
exercisable for or convertible into Common Stock, (other than pursuant to the
terms herein), it shall immediately contribute, lend or otherwise provide the
proceeds of such issuance to the Company. If Parent contributes such proceeds
to the Companys capital, the Company shall issue to the Parent securities of
the Company that have similar economic terms as the securities of the Parent
that were issued that resulted in such proceeds (for example, if the proceeds
are from sale of Common Stock, the Company shall issue a corresponding number
of Class A Units; if such proceeds are from the issuance of Parent preferred
stock, the Company shall issue preferred units to Parent having
corresponding economic terms; and if such proceeds are from issuance of
Parent debt (whether or not convertible into Parent equity), the Company shall
issue debt to Parent having corresponding economic terms and conditions).

 

(d) In the event of any merger, acquisition, reorganization, consolidation, or
liquidation of Parent involving a payment or distribution of cash, securities
or other assets to the holders of Common Stock or any reclassification or
other similar transaction as a result of which the shares of Parent Common
Stock are converted into, among other things, another security and the
Appleton Class B Exchangeable Units shall remain outstanding (a "Fundamental
Transaction"), then the exchange provisions of this Agreement shall thereafter
permit the exchange of Appleton Class B Exchangeable Units for the amount of
such cash, securities or other assets which an Exchanging Member would have
received had he, she or it made an exchange for Common Stock immediately prior
to such Fundamental Transaction, regardless of whether such exchange would
actually have been permitted at such time and taking into account any
adjustment as a result of any division or subdivision (by any split,
distribution or dividend, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization
or otherwise) or combination or consolidation (by reverse split,
reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) of such security, securities
or other property that occurs after the effective time of such merger,
acquisition, consolidation, reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction. For the
avoidance of doubt, if there is any reclassification, reorganization,
recapitalization or other similar transaction in which the Common Stock is
converted or changed into another security, securities or other property,
this Agreement shall continue to be applicable, mutatis mutandis, with respect
to such security, securities or other property.

(e) Parent shall provide all Exchanging Members with notice of any transaction
referred to in clauses (a) and (d) of this Section 4.6 promptly after the
Company provides notice of any such proposed transaction, or otherwise
proposes such transaction, to its stockholders but in no event later than (i)
ten (10) Business Days prior to record date of such transaction, if
applicable, or (ii) twenty (20) Business Days prior to the applicable
effective date or expiration date of such transaction, or (iii) in any such
case, such earlier time as notice thereof shall be required to be given
pursuant to Rule 10b-17 under the Exchange Act. Such notice shall specify all
material terms of such transaction, the record date (if applicable), the
proposed date of consummation of such transaction (the "Proposed Consummation
Date") and the effect of such transaction on the Exchange Ratio. 

Section 4.8 _Government Authority Approval_.

 

(a) _General_. Parent and the Exchanging Members shall cooperate with one
another in (i) determining whether any action in respect of (including any
filing with), or consent, approval, registration or qualification (other than
registration under the Securities Act) or waiver by, any governmental
authority 

 



10 ##### Table of Contents

  

 under any United States federal or state law (a "Governmental Authority") is
required in connection with the issuance of Reciprocate Common Stock upon an
exchange pursuant to Article II hereof, (ii) using their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to take any such actions (including making any
filing or furnishing any information required in connection therewith) in
order to obtain any such consent, approval, registration, qualification or
waiver required in connection with an exchange to be effected in accordance
with Article II hereof on a timely basis and (iii) keeping the other party
promptly informed in all material respects with respect to any communication
given or received in connection with any such action, consent, approval or
waiver, including using reasonable efforts to provide to each other in advance
any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party.

(b) _Certain Filings_. Parent and to the extent required by law, a relevant
Exchanging Member, covenant to make all appropriate filings required by the
HSR Act and any Competition Laws with respect to the issuance of Reciprocate
Common Stock upon an exchange pursuant to Article II hereof as promptly as
practicable in advance of such intended exchange upon written request from the
Exchanging Member and to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply, and
shall cause its Affiliates to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply,
as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any Competition
Laws. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall, and Parent shall cause its
Affiliates to, request early termination of any waiting period or comparable
period under the HSR Act and will not extend any such period or enter into any
agreement with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the issuance of
Reciprocate Common Stock upon an exchange pursuant to Article II hereof,
except with the prior written consent of the applicable Exchanging Member.

(c)  _Parent s Efforts_. Without limiting the provisions set forth in
paragraphs (a) and (b) above and subject to the provisions of this clause (c),
Parent and its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take or
cause to be taken any and all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain any consent, approval or waiver relating to the HSR Act or any
Competition Law that is required for the consummation of the issuance of
Reciprocate Common Stock upon an exchange pursuant to Article II hereof.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude Parent or the Company
from satisfying their respective obligations in respect of the exchange of any
Appleton Class B Exchangeable Unit by delivery of the Reciprocate Common
Stock which are held in the treasury of Parent.

remedy to which such party may be entitled.

a Demand Registration (each such Holder that includes all or a portion of
such Holders Registrable Securities in such Registration, a " _Requesting
Holder_ ") shall so notify the Company, in writing, within five (5) days after
the receipt by the Holder of the notice from the Company. Upon receipt by the
Company of any such written notification from a Requesting Holder(s) to the
Company, such Requesting Holder(s) shall be entitled to have their Registrable
Securities included in a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration and
the Company shall effect, as soon thereafter as practicable, but not more than
forty five (45) days immediately after the Companys receipt of the Demand
Registration, the Registration of all Registrable Securities requested by the
Demanding Holders and Requesting Holders pursuant to such Demand Registration.
Under no circumstances shall the Company be obligated to effect more than an
aggregate of three (3) Registrations pursuant to a Demand Registration under
this _subsection 2.1.1_ with respect to any or all Registrable Securities;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a Registration shall not be counted for such
purposes unless a registration statement on Form S-1 or any similar long-form
registration statement that may be available at such time (" _Form S-1_ ") has
become effective and all of the Registrable Securities requested by the
Requesting Holders to be registered on behalf of the Requesting Holders in
such Form S-1 Registration have been sold, in accordance with _Section 3\. 1_
of this Agreement.

 

2.1.2 _Effective Registration_. Notwithstanding the provisions of _subsection
2.1.1_ above or any other part of this Agreement, a Registration pursuant to

the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with respect to a
Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration has been declared effective by
the Commission and (ii) the Company has complied with all of its obligations
under this Agreement with respect thereto; _provided_ , _further_ , that if,
after such Registration Statement has been declared effective, an offering of
Registrable Securities in a Registration pursuant to a

 



5 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Demand Registration is subsequently interfered with by any stop order or
injunction of the Commission, federal or state court or any other governmental
agency, the Registration Statement with respect to such Registration shall be
deemed not to have been declared effective, unless and until, (i) such stop
order or injunction is removed, rescinded or otherwise terminated, and (ii) a
majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders initiating such Demand
Registration thereafter affirmatively elect to continue with such Registration
and accordingly notify the Company of such election in writing no later than
five (5) days after such stop order or injunction is removed, rescinded or
otherwise terminated; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not be
obligated or required to file another Registration Statement until the

Holders so advise the Company as part of their Demand Registration that the
offering of the Registrable Securities pursuant to such Demand Registration
shall be in the form of an Underwritten Offering, then the right of such
Demanding Holder or Requesting Holder (if any) to include its Registrable
Securities in such Registration shall be conditioned upon such Holders
participation in such Underwritten Offering and the inclusion of such Holders
Registrable Securities in such Underwritten Offering to the extent provided
herein. All such Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities
through an Underwritten Offering under this _subsection 2.1.3_ shall enter
into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s)
selected for such Underwritten Offering by the majority-in-interest of the
Demanding Holders initiating the Demand Registration.

2.1.4 _Reduction of Underwritten Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters in an Underwritten Registration pursuant to a Demand
Registration, in good faith, advises the Company, the Demanding Holders and
the Requesting Holders (if any) in writing that the dollar amount or number of
Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders
(if any) desire to sell, taken together with all other Common Stock or other
equity securities that the Company desires to sell and the Common Stock, if
any, as to which a Registration has been requested pursuant to separate
written contractual piggy-back registration rights held by any other
stockholders who desire to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum
number of equity securities that can be sold in the Underwritten Offering
without adversely affecting the proposed offering price, the timing, the
distribution method, or the probability of success of such offering (such
maximum dollar amount or maximum number of such securities, as applicable,
the " _Maximum Number of Securities_ "), then the Company shall include in
such Underwritten Offering, as follows: (i) first, the Registrable Securities

Requesting Holder (if any) has requested be included in such Underwritten

Demanding Holders and Requesting Holders have requested be included in such
Underwritten Registration (such proportion is referred to herein as " _Pro
Rata_ ")) that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities;
(ii) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been
reached under the foregoing clause (i), the Registrable Securities of Holders
exercising their rights to register their Registrable Securities pursuant to
_subsection 2.2.1_ hereof, without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities; and (iii) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the
Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell,
which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (iv)

other equity securities of other persons or entities that the Company is
obligated to register in a Registration pursuant to separate written
contractual arrangements with such persons and that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.

Registration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses incurred in
connection a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration prior to its
withdrawal under this _subsection 2.1.5_.

 

2.2 _Piggyback Registration._

2.2.1 _Piggyback Rights_. If, at any time on or after the date the Company
consummates a Business Combination, the Company proposes to file a
Registration Statement under the Securities Act with respect to an offering

stockholders of the Company including, without limitation, pursuant to S
_ection 2.1_ hereof), other than a Registration Statement (i) filed
in connection with any employee stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) for
an exchange offer or offering of securities solely to the Companys existing
stockholders, (iii) for an offering of debt that is convertible into
equity securities of the Company or (iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan,

Registration_ "). The Company shall, in good faith, cause such Registrable
Securities and PDC Registrable Securities to be included in such Piggyback

terms and conditions as any similar securities of the Company included

Registrable Securities and PDC Registrable Securities in accordance with the
intended method(s) of distribution thereof. All such Holders proposing to
distribute their Registrable Securities and PDC Registrable Securities

selected for such Underwritten Offering by the Company.

2.2.2 _Reduction of Piggyback Registration_. If the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters in an Underwritten Registration that is to be a Piggyback

Common Stock that the Company desires to sell, taken together with (i) the
Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration has been demanded pursuant to
separate written contractual arrangements with persons or entities other than
the Holders of Registrable Securities and PDC Registrable Securities
hereunder (ii) the Registrable Securities and PDC Registrable Securities as to
which registration has been requested pursuant _Section 2.2_ hereof, and
(iii) the Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration has been requested

to which Registration has been requested pursuant to written contractual
piggy-back registration rights of other stockholders of the Company, which
can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities;

than the Holders of Registrable Securities and PDC Registrable Securities,
then the Company shall include in any such Registration (A) first, the Common
Stock or other equity securities, if any, of such requesting persons or
entities, other than the Holders of Registrable Securities and PDC Registrable
Securities, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities; (B) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities
has not been reached under the foregoing clause (A), the Registrable

Securities and PDC Registrable Securities that each Holder has requested be
included in such Underwritten Registration and the aggregate number of
Registrable Securities and PDC Registrable Securities that the Holders have
requested to be included in such Underwritten Registration, which can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (C) third, to the extent
that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the Common Stock or other equity securities

persons or entities that the Company is obligated to register pursuant to
separate written contractual arrangements with such persons or entities, which
can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.

2.2.3 _Piggyback Registration Withdrawal._ Any Holder of Registrable
Securities and PDC Registrable Securities shall have the right to withdraw
from a Piggyback Registration for any or no reason whatsoever upon written
notification to the Company and the Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of
his, her or its intention to withdraw from such Piggyback Registration prior
to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement filed with the Commission
with respect to such Piggyback Registration. The Company (whether on its own
good faith determination or as the result of a request for withdrawal by
persons pursuant to separate written contractual obligations) may withdraw
a Registration Statement filed with the Commission in connection with a
Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses
incurred in connection with the Piggyback Registration prior to its withdrawal
under this _subsection 2.2.3_.

2.2.4 _Unlimited Piggyback Registration Rights_. For purposes of clarity, any
Registration effected pursuant to _Section 2.2_ hereof shall not be counted
as a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration effected under _Section
2.1_ hereof.

2.3 _Registrations on Form S-3_.

 

2.3.1 The Holders of Registrable Securities may at any time, and from time to
time, request in writing that the Company, pursuant to Rule 415 under the
Securities Act (or any successor rule promulgated thereafter by the
Commission), register the resale of any or all of their Registrable Securities
on a registration statement on Form S-3 or any similar short-form registration
statement that may be available at such time (such registration statement, "
_Form S-3_ ", and each registration of securities on such Form S-3, a " _Shelf
Registration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
obligated to effect such request through an Underwritten Offering. Within five
(5) days of the Companys receipt of a written request from a Holder or
Holders of Registrable Securities for a Shelf Registration, the Company shall
promptly give written notice of the proposed Shelf Registration to all other
Holders of Registrable Securities, and each Holder of Registrable Securities
who thereafter wishes to include all or a portion of such
Holders Registrable Securities in such Shelf Registration

 



8 ##### Table of Contents

  

 shall so notify the Company, in writing, within ten (10) days after the
receipt by the Holder of the notice from the Company. As soon as practicable
thereafter, but not more than twelve (12) days after the Companys initial
receipt of such written request for a Shelf Registration, the Company shall
register all or such portion of such Holders Registrable Securities as are
specified in such written request, together with all or such portion of
Registrable Securities of any other Holder or Holders joining in such request
as are specified in the written notification given by such Holder or Holders;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to effect
any such Registration pursuant to this _Section 2.3.1_ if (i) a Form S-3 is
not available for such offering or (ii) the Holders of Registrable Securities,
together with the Holders of any other equity securities of the Company
entitled to inclusion in such Registration, propose to sell the Registrable
Securities and such other equity securities (if any) at any aggregate price to
the public of less than $10,000,000.

 

2.3.2 The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, within
fifteen (15) Business Days of the Purchase Agreement Closing to register for
resale all of the Registrable Securities and the PDC Registrable Securities in
a Shelf Registration on Form S-3. If Form S-3 is not available, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to convert any
Shelf Registration that is on a Form S-l to a Registration Statement on Form
S-3 as soon as practicable after the Company is eligible to use Form S-3. The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect such Shelf
Registration by filing a Form S-3 or such other appropriate form, if
applicable, as soon as practicable, and effect the registration of all such
Registrable Securities and PDC Registrable Securities. If any Registrable
Securities or PDC Registrable Securities remain issued and outstanding after
three (3) years following the initial effective date of such Shelf
Registration, the Company shall, prior to the expiration of such Shelf
Registration, file a new Form S-3 covering such PDC Registrable Securities and
shall thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such new
Shelf Registration to be declared effective as promptly as practical. The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of the Shelf Registration in accordance with the terms hereof
for so long as any Registrable Securities or PDC Registrable Securities remain
issued and outstanding.

2.3.3 Upon the Company becoming a WKSI, the Company shall (i) give written
notice thereof to the Holders as soon as practicable, but in no event later
than twenty (20) days thereafter, and such notice shall describe, in
reasonable detail, the basis on which the Company has become a WKSI, and (ii)
use commercially reasonable efforts to register, under an automatic shelf
registration statement on Form S-3ASR (" _Automatic Shelf Registration
Statement_ "), the sale of all of the Registrable Securities and the PDC
Registrable Securities. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to file such Automatic Shelf Registration Statement as promptly
as practicable and to cause such Automatic Shelf Registration Statement to
remain effective thereafter until there are no longer any PDC Registrable
Securities or Registrable Securities registered on such Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement. If at any time after the filing of an Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement by the Company the Company determines that it is no
longer a WKSI (such time, the " _Determination Date_ "), within twenty (20)
days after such Determination Date, the Company shall (A) give written notice
thereof to the Holders and (B) file a Registration Statement on an appropriate
form (or a post-effective amendment converting the Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement to an appropriate form) covering all of the PDC
Registrable Securities and Registrable Securities, and use commercially
reasonable efforts to have such Registration Statement declared effective as
promptly as practicable after the date the Automatic Shelf Registration
Statement is no longer useable by the Holders to sell PDC Registrable
Securities or Registrable Securities.

 

2.3.4 At any time and from time to time after a Shelf Registration has been
declared effective by the Commission, PDC, the Founder or the Sponsor may
request to sell all or any portion of the PDC Registrable Shares or
Registrable Securities, as applicable, in an Underwritten Offering that is
registered pursuant to such Shelf Registration (each, an " _Underwritten
Shelf Takedown_ "). All requests for Underwritten Shelf Takedowns shall be
made by giving written notice to the Company (each, a " _Demand Shelf Takedown
Notice_ ") at least 15 days prior to the proposed date of such Underwritten
Shelf Takedown. Each Demand Shelf Takedown Notice shall specify (i) the type
and number of PDC Registrable Securities or Registrable Securities proposed to
be sold in the Underwritten Shelf Takedown; and (ii) the intended method or
methods and plan of disposition thereof. In such event, the right of such
person to include PDC Registrable Securities or Registrable Securities, as

 



9 ##### Table of Contents

  

 applicable, in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown shall be conditioned upon
such persons participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of PDC
Registrable Securities or Registrable Securities, as applicable, in the
underwriting. Such person shall enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form with the Underwriter or Underwriters selected for such
underwriting by the Company.

 

2.3.5 Any Shelf Registration pursuant to this Section 2.3 and any Automatic
Shelf Registration, may (i) at the option of the Company, include a
registration of the issuance of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
warrants issued by the Company and (ii) at the option of the Sponsor, include
a registration of the sale of Registrable Securities by limited partners
of the Sponsor (and in such case, such limited partners shall be considered
Holders for purposes of Article IV of this Agreement).

 

2.3.6 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, during any
period that the Shelf Registration is not for any reason effective, PDC shall
have a Demand Registration pursuant to _Section 2.1_ during such period.

2.4 _Restrictions on Registration Rights_. If (A) during the period starting
with the date sixty (60) days prior to the Companys good faith estimate of
the date of the filing of, and ending on a date one hundred and twenty (120)
days after the effective date of, a Company-initiated Registration and
provided that the Company has delivered written notice to the Holders prior to
receipt of a Demand Registration pursuant to _subsection 2.1.1_ and it
continues to actively employ, in good faith, all reasonable efforts to cause
the applicable Registration Statement to become effective; (B) the Holders or
PDC, as the case may be, have requested an Underwritten Registration and the
Company and the Holders or PDC are unable to obtain the commitment of
underwriters to firmly underwrite the offer; or (C) in the good faith judgment
of the Board such Registration would be seriously detrimental to the Company
and the Board concludes as a result that it is essential to defer the filing
of such Registration Statement to be filed pursuant to Section 2.1.1 or
Section 2.3.1 at such time, then in each case the Company shall furnish to
such Holders or PDC, as the case may be, a certificate signed by the Chairman
of the Board stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board it would be
seriously detrimental to the Company for such Registration Statement to be
filed in the near future and that it is therefore essential to defer the
filing of such Registration Statement. In such event, the Company shall have
the right to defer such filing for a period of not more than thirty (30) days;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not defer its obligation in
this manner more than once in any 12 month period. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Registration shall be effected
or permitted and no Registration Statement shall become effective, with
respect to any Registrable Securities held by each of the Founder and the
Sponsor, until after the expiration of the Founder Lock-Up Period or the
Sponsor Lock-Up Period, as the case may be.

of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement to
consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities in such
jurisdictions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required

and file such supplement or amendment as soon as practicable after the time of
such notice), or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use
of the Prospectus may be resumed. If the filing, initial effectiveness or
continued use of a Registration Statement in respect of any Registration at
any time would require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure or
would require the inclusion in such Registration Statement of financial
statements that are unavailable to the Company for reasons beyond the
Companys control, the Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such
action to the Holders, delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or
suspend use of, such Registration Statement for the shortest period of time,

 event more than thirty (30) days, determined in good faith by the Company to
be necessary for such purpose. In the event the Company exercises its rights
under the preceding sentence, the Holders agree to suspend, immediately upon
their receipt of the notice referred to above, their use of the Prospectus
relating to any Registration in connection with any sale or offer to sell
Registrable Securities and PDC Registrable Securities, respectively. The
Company shall immediately notify the Holders of the expiration of any period
during which it exercised its rights under this _Section 3.4_.

3.5 _Reporting Obligations_. As long as any Holder shall own Registrable
Securities or PDC Registrable Securities, the Company, at all times while it
shall be reporting under the Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or
obtain extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace
period) all reports required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof
pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and to promptly
furnish the Holders with true and complete copies of all such filings. The
Company further covenants that it shall take such further action as any Holder
may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable
such Holder to sell shares of the Common Stock held by such Holder without
registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions
provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, including providing
any legal opinions. Upon the request of any Holder, the Company shall deliver
to such Holder a written certification of a duly authorized officer as to
whether it has complied with such requirements.

INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION

4.1 Indemnification:

4.1.1 The Company agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each
Holder of Registrable Securities and PDC Registrable Securities and their
respective officers and directors and each person who controls such Holder
(within the meaning of the Securities Act) against all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys fees) caused
by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any
Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same are caused by or
contained in any information furnished in writing to the Company by such
Holder expressly for use therein. The Company shall indemnify the
Underwriters, their officers and directors and each person who controls such
Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as
provided in the foregoing with respect to the indemnification of the Holder.

4.1.2 In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of
Registrable Securities or PDC Registrable Securities is participating, such
Holder shall furnish to the Company in writing such information and affidavits
as the Company reasonably requests for use in connection with any
such Registration Statement or Prospectus and, to the extent permitted by
law, shall indemnify the Company, its directors and officers and agents and
each person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities
Act) against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including
without limitation reasonable attorneys fees) resulting from any untrue
statement of material fact contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus
or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or
any omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such
untrue statement or omission is contained in any information or affidavit so
furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use therein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, with respect to such Holders, the obligation to indemnify
shall be several, not joint and several, among such Holders and the liability
of each such Holder shall be in proportion to and limited to the net proceeds
received by such Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities and PDC
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. The Holders
shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers, directors and each person
who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to
the same extent as provided in the foregoing with respect to indemnification
of the Company.

4.1.3 Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which
it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice
shall not impair any persons right to indemnification hereunder to the extent
such failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii)
unless in such indemnified partys reasonable judgment a conflict of interest
between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to
such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such
claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such
defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its
consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying
party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim
shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel
for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such
claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict
of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such
indemnified parties with respect to such claim. No indemnifying party shall,
without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement which cannot be settled in all respects
by the payment of money (and such money is so paid by the indemnifying party
pursuant to the terms of such settlement) or which settlement does not include
as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to
such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such
claim or litigation.

4.1.4 The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf
of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person of
such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities. The
Company and each Holder participating in an offering, also agree to make such
provisions as are reasonably requested by any indemnified party for
contribution to such party in the event the Companys or such Holders
indemnification is unavailable for any reason. 

4.1.5 If the indemnification provided under _Section 4.1_ hereof from the
indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as well as
any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying partys and
indemnified partys relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the liability of any Holder under this _subsection 4.1.5_ shall be limited to
the amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder in such offering
giving rise to such liability. The amount paid or payable by a party as a
result of the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to
include, subject to the limitations set forth in  _subsections 4.1.1_ ,
_4.1.2_ and _4.1.3_ above, any legal or other fees, charges or expenses
reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or
proceeding. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable
if contribution pursuant to this _subsection 4.1.5_ were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation, which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in this _subsection
4.1.5_. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution
pursuant to this _subsection 4.1.5_ from any person who was not guilty of
such fraudulent misrepresentation.

in part.

 

5.2.2 Except as set forth in _subsection 5.2.1_ hereof, this Agreement and the
rights, duties and obligations of the Holders hereunder may be assigned or
delegated by such Holder in conjunction with and to the extent of any transfer
of Registrable Securities or PDC Registrable Securities by any such Holder.

assignee, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to be bound by the

assignment made other than as provided in this _Section 5.2_ shall be null

and the Holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the
Registrable Securities and PDC, at the time in question, compliance with any
of the provisions, covenants and conditions set forth in this Agreement may be
waived, or any of such provisions, covenants or conditions may be amended or
modified; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, any
amendment hereto or waiver hereof that adversely affects one Holder solely in
its capacity as a holder of the shares of capital stock of the Company, in a
manner that is materially different from the other Holders (in such capacity)
shall require the consent of PDC or the Holder so affected. No course of
dealing between any Holder or the Company and any other party hereto or any
failure or delay on the part of a Holder or the Company in exercising any
rights or remedies under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any
rights or remedies of any Holder or the Company. No single or partial exercise
of any rights or remedies under this Agreement by a party shall operate as a
waiver or preclude the exercise of any other rights or remedies hereunder or
thereunder by such party.

 

5.6 _Other Registration Rights_. The Company represents and warrants that no
person, other than PDC and a Holder of Registrable Securities, has any right
to require the Company to register any securities of the Company for sale or

Company for the sale of securities for its own account or for the account of
