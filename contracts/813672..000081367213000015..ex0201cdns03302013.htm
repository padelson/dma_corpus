and the holders of any and all other equity interests in or of the Company
(including the Company Warrants, Unvested Non-Employee Company Options, any

interests, in the aggregate, more than the Total Merger Consideration. Any
payments or other consideration that would otherwise be owed to such persons
in their capacity as Cash Consideration Recipients, the Unvested Employee
Company Options or holders of other equity interests of the Company as a
result of the Transactions that would cause the aggregate payments to such
persons to be in excess of the Total Merger Consideration (and subject to
Section 1.8(e) and Article 7) shall be deemed to be a Company Transaction
Expense.

(d) Subject to Section 1.10 and Article 7, Distributions pursuant to this
Agreement shall be allocated among and paid to the Cash Consideration
Recipients in accordance with this Section 1.8(d) and as set forth in the
Closing Consideration Spreadsheet and this Agreement.

(i) On the Closing Date:

(A) Each share of Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (excluding shares of Company Preferred Stock that are converted
prior to the Effective Time) shall receive an amount per share equal to (1)
the amount of the applicable Liquidation Preference of such share of Company
Preferred Stock, as set forth in the Company's Certificate of Incorporation,
multiplied by (2) 0.875.

(B) Each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including shares of Company Common Stock issued upon (1) the
conversion of shares of Company Preferred Stock that are converted (or deemed
converted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) into Company Common Stock
prior to the Effective Time or (2) the exercise of Company Warrants or Company
Stock Options that are exercised (or deemed exercised or converted, including
on a "net exercise basis" or "cashless basis", pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement) prior to the Effective Time) shall receive an amount per share
equal to (x) the Base Common Per Share Amount multiplied by (y) 0.875.

(C) Each Option Share that would be issued upon the exercise in full for cash
(non-net exercise) of any Vested Company Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and cancelled pursuant to Section
1.11(a) shall, in accordance with Section 1.11(a), receive an amount per share
equal to (1) the excess, if any, of (a) the Base Common 

Per Share Amount minus (b) the applicable per share exercise price for such
Option Share, multiplied by (2) 0.875.

(ii) Upon any release of the Escrow Fund or Reserve Amount to the Escrow
Holders, each Escrow Holder shall receive an amount equal to (A) the amount of
such Distribution multiplied by (B) such Escrow Holder's Recovery Percentage.

(e) Escrow. No later than two Business Days after the Closing Date, Parent, on
behalf of the Surviving Corporation, will transfer to, and deposit with, the
Escrow Agent an amount equal to the Escrow Amount plus the Reserve Amount.
Such Escrow Amount shall become part of the Escrow Fund established pursuant
to Article 7 and such Reserve Amount shall become part of the Reserve Fund
established pursuant to Article 7. The portion of the Escrow Amount and the
portion of the Reserve Amount withheld with respect to each Escrow Holder will
be in proportion to the amount of the Base Cash Amount payable to such Escrow
Holder pursuant to Section 1.8(a) and/or Section 1.11(a) compared to the
amount of the Base Cash Amount payable to all Escrow Holders. Such amount and
such Escrow Holder's allocated percentage of the Escrow Fund and the Reserve
Fund (such percentage, an Escrow Holder's "Recovery Percentage") will be set
forth on the Closing Consideration Spreadsheet. For the sake of clarity, the
amount actually deposited into the Reserve Fund in respect of each Escrow
Holder shall be determined without regard to withholding Taxes applicable to
such amounts, and any such withholding Taxes applicable to amounts deposited
into the Reserve Fund shall reduce other amounts payable to such Escrow
Holder. Thus, for example, if $100 would be deposited into the Reserve Fund on
behalf of an Escrow Holder (prior to any withholding Tax) and Taxes in the
amount of $25 are required to be withheld with respect to such $100 deposit,
$100 shall be deposited into the Reserve Fund with respect to such Escrow
Holder and other payments to such Escrow Holder in connection with the Closing
(determined after all required Tax withholding) shall be reduced by such $25.

(f) Acquisition Sub Shares. At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of
common stock, no par value, of Acquisition Sub shall be converted into one
share of common stock, no par value, of the Surviving Corporation.

(g) Treasury Shares. Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company, or any of the Company's wholly-owned
subsidiaries, prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

Section 1.9 Dissenters' Rights. Shares that have not been voted for approval
of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and with respect to which a
demand for payment and appraisal have been properly made in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL or Chapter 13 of the General Corporation Law of the
State of California (the "CGCL") (such Shares, "Dissenting Shares"), will not
be converted into the right to receive that portion of the Total Merger
Consideration otherwise payable with respect to such Dissenting Shares after
the Effective Time pursuant to Section 1.8, but will instead be converted into
the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with
respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the laws of the State of
Delaware or the State of California, as the case may be. If a holder of
Dissenting Shares (a "Dissenting Stockholder") withdraws such holder's demand
for such payment and appraisal or 

becomes ineligible for such payment and appraisal, then, as of the Effective
Time or the occurrence of such event of withdrawal or ineligibility, whichever
last occurs, such holder's Dissenting Shares will cease to be Dissenting
Shares and will be converted into the right to receive, and will be
exchangeable for, that portion of the Total Merger Consideration into which
such Dissenting Shares would have been converted pursuant to Section 1.8. Each
Dissenting Stockholder who, pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or Chapter 13
of the CGCL, becomes entitled to payment of the value of the Dissenting Shares
will receive payment therefor (but only after the value therefor has been
agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions). The Company
shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal and/or payment of fair value for Shares, attempted written
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL or the CGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders' rights
to appraisal with respect to the Merger and (b) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any exercise of such appraisal
rights under the DGCL or the CGCL. The Company shall not, and shall cause each
of its subsidiaries, affiliates and Company Representatives not to, except
with the prior written consent of Parent or as may be required by such
applicable law, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands.

Section 1.10 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Payment Procedures. The Escrow Agent shall act as payment agent in
connection with the Merger. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, and no later than two Business Days after the Closing Date, Parent, on
behalf of the Surviving Corporation, will transfer to, and deposit with, the
Escrow Agent an amount in cash equal to the Base Cash Amount minus the Escrow
Amount and the Reserve Amount in accordance with Section 1.8(e); provided,
that in the case of payments to employees or former employees of the Company
for which Tax withholding is required, such payments may be made through the
Company's or Parent's payroll processing service or system.

(b) Letter of Transmittal. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (and in any event within five Business Days thereafter), the
Escrow Agent shall mail to (x) each holder of record of a Certificate(s) and
whose Shares were converted into the right to receive a portion of the Total
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8(a) and (y) each holder of record
of a Vested Company Option whose Option Shares were converted into the right
to receive a portion of the Total Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
1.11(a) ("Vested Optionholder"): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that, in the case of Certificates, delivery shall be effected and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon receipt of the
Certificates by the Escrow Agent) (a "Letter of Transmittal"); and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates and the Vested
Company Options in exchange for a portion, if any, of the Total Merger
Consideration to which the Shares, represented by such Certificate, or Vested
Company Options are entitled under and in accordance with this Agreement. Upon
surrender to the Escrow Agent of a Certificate for cancellation together with
such Letter of Transmittal duly completed and executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount of
cash determined in accordance with Section 1.8 with respect to the number of
Shares represented by such Certificate (less any applicable withholding Taxes)
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Upon delivery
to the Escrow Agent of a Letter of Transmittal duly executed, 

the holder of a Vested Company Option shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor an amount of cash determined in accordance with Section 1.8 and
Section 1.11(a) with respect to such Vested Company Option (less any
applicable withholding Taxes) and the Vested Company Option shall forthwith be
cancelled in exchange for such cash. As soon as reasonably practicable
following delivery of a duly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal as
described above, and, in the case of Stockholders, a Certificate, the Escrow
Agent shall remit, or cause to be remitted, payment, if any, due to such
Stockholder or Vested Optionholder in accordance with the remittance
instructions provided in the Letter of Transmittal. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, cash, if any, may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such Shares is presented to the Escrow Agent accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and affect such transfer. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 1.10, each Certificate or Vested Company Option
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender a portion of the Total Merger
Consideration, if any, as contemplated by Section 1.8, Section 1.11 and this
Section 1.10. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, Holdings and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled, but not obligated, to offset any
outstanding amounts due and payable (including all principal, accrued but
unpaid interest, and other amounts) under any promissory note or other
instrument evidencing indebtedness of a Stockholder or Vested Optionholder
owed to the Company, Holdings or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates
or subsidiaries, including any Employee Indebtedness to be repaid pursuant to
Section 4.20, prior to distributing any portion of the Total Merger
Consideration to such Stockholder or Vested Optionholder (including the offset
of any such outstanding amounts against the Total Merger Consideration with
respect to the exercise price of any Company Stock Options).

(c) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Escrow Agent shall issue in exchange therefor, upon the
delivery of an affidavit (in a form satisfactory to the Escrow Agent and
Parent) of that fact by the record holder thereof, cash as may be required, if
any, pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that the Escrow Agent or
Parent may require the delivery of a suitable bond or indemnity.

(d) No Further Registration. The portion of the Total Merger Consideration
paid upon the surrender of Shares or Vested Company Options in accordance with
the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Shares or Vested Company Options, subject to Article
7. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
Shares, Company Stock Options or Company Warrants that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Company Stock Options or Company Warrants are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
for the applicable portion of the Total Merger Consideration, if any, as
provided in this Article 1.

(e) Escheat. None of Parent, Holdings or the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder of Shares, Company Warrants or Company Stock Options for
cash constituting a portion of the Total Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. 

Section 1.11 Stock Options, Restricted Shares and Warrants.

(a) Stock Options.

(i) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option, to the extent vested
immediately prior to the Effective Time, that is not exercised prior to the
Effective Time (a "Vested Company Option"), if any, shall be cancelled and
terminated and shall not be assumed or substituted by Parent, Holdings or the
Surviving Corporation. Instead, at and after the Effective Time, each such
Vested Company Option shall represent, for each Option Share underlying such
Vested Company Option, a right to receive a cash amount equal to the excess,
if any, of the Base Common Per Share Amount less the applicable per share
exercise price for such Option Share, subject to Section 1.8(e), Section 1.10
and the Escrow Fund, Reserve Fund and indemnity provisions in Article 7. Prior
to the Closing, the Company shall have taken all actions, if any, necessary to
cause the cancellation and termination of such Vested Company Options and the
treatment of such Vested Company Options in the manner described in this
Section 1.11(a)(i), including providing any required notice to holders of such
Vested Company Options pursuant to the documents governing such Company Stock
Options.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option, to the extent unvested
immediately prior to the Effective Time, that is held by an employee of the
Company continuing employment with Parent immediately after the Effective Time
("Unvested Employee Company Options") shall be assumed by Parent, subject to
this Section 1.11(a)(ii), together with the terms of the relevant stock option
plan and the agreement evidencing the grant thereunder of such assumed
Unvested Employee Company Option. At and after the Effective Time, each
Unvested Employee Company Option assumed by Parent pursuant to this Section
1.11(a)(ii) shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions set forth in the relevant stock option plan and the agreement
evidencing the grant thereof immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including provisions with respect to vesting, except that: (A) such Unvested
Employee Company Option will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock, equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable
upon exercise of such option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (2) the Exchange Ratio; and (B) the per share exercise price of
each such Unvested Employee Company Option shall be adjusted by dividing (1)
the per share exercise price of each such option immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (2) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding up to the nearest cent.
The terms of each Unvested Employee Company Option shall, in accordance with
its terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any
stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction
with respect to Parent Common Stock after the Effective Time. Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall have taken all actions, if any, necessary to cause
the treatment of such Unvested Employee Company Options in the manner
described in this Section 1.11(a)(ii), including providing any required notice
to holders of such Unvested Employee Company Options pursuant to the documents
governing such Company Stock Options.

(iii) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option, to the extent unvested
immediately prior to the Effective Time, that is held by a person other than
an employee of the Company continuing employment with Parent immediately after
the Effective Time 

("Unvested Non-Employee Company Options"), and that has not been exercised
prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and terminated and shall not
be assumed or substituted by Parent, Holdings or the Surviving Corporation.
Prior to the Closing, the Company shall have taken all actions, if any,
necessary to cause the cancellation and termination of such Unvested Non-
Employee Company Options and the treatment of such Unvested Non-Employee
Company Options in the manner described in this Section 1.11(a)(iii),
including providing any required notice to holders of such Unvested Non-
Employee Company Options pursuant to the documents governing such Company
Stock Options.

(b) Warrants. At the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase shares of
capital stock of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that has not been exercised prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Company
Warrant"), if any, shall be cancelled and terminated and shall not be assumed
or substituted by Parent, Holdings or the Surviving Corporation. Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall have taken all actions, if any, necessary to cause
the cancellation and termination of such Company Warrants and the treatment of
such Company Warrants in the manner described in this Section 1.11(b),
including providing any required notice to or obtaining a waiver of such
notice from the holders of the Company Warrants pursuant to the documents
governing such Company Warrants.

Section 1.12 Post-Closing Adjustment.

(a) At least three Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to Parent a
written statement (the "Preliminary Closing Statement") that shall include and
set forth (i) an estimated consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the
Closing Date (the "Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet"), and (ii) a good-faith
estimate of (A) Working Capital based on the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet
(the "Estimated Working Capital"), and (B) Company Debt (the "Estimated
Company Debt") (with each of Estimated Working Capital and Estimated Company
Debt determined as of the Closing Date and without giving effect to the
transactions contemplated herein). Estimated Working Capital and Estimated
Company Debt shall be calculated in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis
consistent with the preparation of the Company Balance Sheet (provided that in
the event of a conflict between GAAP and consistent application thereof, GAAP
shall prevail) (the "Applicable Accounting Principles"). All calculations of
Estimated Working Capital and Estimated Company Debt shall be accompanied by a
certificate of the CEO and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company
certifying that such estimates have been calculated in good faith in
accordance with this Agreement. All such estimates shall be subject to the
Parent's approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and
shall control solely for purposes of determining the amounts payable at the
Closing pursuant to Section 1.8 and shall not limit or otherwise affect the
Parent's remedies under this Agreement or otherwise, or constitute an
acknowledgement by the Parent of the accuracy of the amounts reflected
thereof. For purposes of determining the amounts payable on the Closing Date,
the Working Capital Adjustment Amount shall be based on Estimated Working
Capital, and Company Debt shall be based on Estimated Company Debt, each
determined in accordance with this Section 1.12(a). 

(b) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall
prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Agent (on behalf of the Stockholders) a
written statement (the "Final Closing Statement") that shall include and set
forth (i) a consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date
(the "Closing Balance Sheet"), (ii) a calculation of the actual (A) Working
Capital (the "Closing Working Capital"), (B) Company Debt (the "Closing
Company Debt"), and (C) Company Transaction Expenses (the "Closing Company
Transaction Expenses") (with each of Closing Working Capital, Closing Company
Debt and Closing Company Transaction Expenses determined as of the Closing
Date and, except for Closing Company Transaction Expenses, without giving
effect to the transactions contemplated herein). Closing Working Capital and
Closing Company Debt shall be calculated in accordance with the Applicable
Accounting Principles.

(c) The Final Closing Statement shall become final and binding on the 30th day
following delivery thereof, unless prior to the end of such period, the
Stockholder Agent delivers to the Parent written notice of its disagreement (a
"Notice of Disagreement") specifying the nature and amount of any dispute as
to the Closing Working Capital, Closing Company Debt, and/or Closing Company
Transaction Expenses, as set forth in the Final Closing Statement. The
Stockholder Agent shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts of
Closing Working Capital, Closing Company Debt, and/or Closing Company
Transaction Expenses unless referenced in a timely Notice of Disagreement. Any
Notice of Disagreement may reference only disagreements based on mathematical
errors or based on amounts of the Closing Working Capital, Closing Company
Debt, and/or Closing Company Transaction Expenses as reflected on the Final
Closing Statement not being calculated in accordance with the Applicable
Accounting Principles.

(d) During the 15-day period following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement by
the Stockholder Agent to the Parent, the parties in good faith shall seek to
resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to the
computation of the Closing Working Capital, Closing Company Debt, and/or
Closing Company Transaction Expenses as specified therein. Any disputed items
resolved in writing between the Stockholder Agent and the Parent within such
15-day period shall be final and binding with respect to such items, and if
the Stockholder Agent and the Parent agree in writing on the resolution of
each disputed item specified by the Stockholder Agent in the Notice of
Disagreement and the amount of the Closing Working Capital, Closing Company
Debt, and/or Closing Company Transaction Expenses, the amounts so determined
shall be final and binding on the parties for all purposes hereunder.

(e) "Net Adjustment Amount" means an aggregate amount (in no event less than
zero) equal to:

(i) if the Closing Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 1.12 is less than each of the Estimated Working Capital and the Target
Working Capital, the amount equal to (x) the lesser of the Estimated Working
Capital and the Target Working Capital minus (y) the Closing Working Capital,
plus

(ii) an aggregate amount (in no event less than zero) equal to (A) the Closing
Company Debt minus the Estimated Company Debt, plus (B) the Closing Company
Transaction Expenses minus the Estimated Company Transaction Expenses, minus
(C) if both the Closing Working Capital and Target Working Capital are, as
finally determined pursuant to this 

Section 1.12, greater than the Estimated Working Capital, the amount equal to
(x) the lesser of the Closing Working Capital and the Target Working Capital
minus (y) Estimated Working Capital.

(f) If the Net Adjustment Amount is a positive amount then such amount shall
be deemed a Special Loss, and Parent shall deliver written notice to the
Escrow Agent and the Stockholder Agent specifying a Special Loss for such Net
Adjustment Amount and the Escrow Agent shall pay such Special Loss out of the
Escrow Fund to Holdings in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement
and neither the Stockholder Agent nor any Stockholder, Escrow Holder,
Optionholder or holder of any other Company Securities shall be entitled to
object to such claim against the Escrow Fund.

subsection, paragraph or clause of the Company Disclosure Schedule applicable
to such Section, subsection, paragraph or clause, that:

Section 2.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.

(a) Organization. The Company is duly organized, validly existing and in good

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and has all requisite power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its

(b) Qualifications. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is duly qualified
or licensed and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which
the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except in
such jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and
in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company or any such subsidiary. For purposes hereof, the
term "Material Adverse Effect on the Company" means any circumstance
involving, change in, or effect on (or any circumstance, change or effect that
would be reasonably likely to have a change in or effect on) the Company or
any of its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i) that is, or is reasonably
likely to be, materially adverse to the operations, assets, liabilities
(including contingent liabilities), results of operations or the condition
(financial or otherwise) of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, excluding from the foregoing the effect, if any, of (A) changes in
general economic conditions or changes generally affecting the industry in
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries operate that do not
disproportionally affect the Company or any of its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, as compared to the Company's and its subsidiaries' competitors, (B)
changes resulting from or caused by acts of terrorism or war (whether or not
declared) or natural disasters occurring after the date hereof, (C) after the

changes that arise out of, result from or relate to the Merger or the
announcement or consummation thereof, or a disruption in supplier,
distributor, landlord or partner relationships as a result of the announcement
or pendency of the Merger, but only in each case to the extent demonstrated by
the Company to have been caused by such announcement or pendency, (E) any
failure by the Company to meet any projections or forecasts for any period
ending on or after the Balance Sheet Date (for the avoidance of doubt, this
clause (E) shall not preclude Parent from asserting that the underlying reason
or cause of any such failure is a Material Adverse Effect on the Company), and
(F) any action or inaction expressly requested of the Company and its
subsidiaries in writing by Parent or expressly required pursuant to this
Agreement or (ii) that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay or impair the ability of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to
consummate the Transactions.

breach, default or violation (and no event has occurred that with notice or
the lapse of time or both would constitute a breach, default or violation) of
any term, condition or provision of (i) its Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws (or, in the case of the Company's subsidiaries, similar governing
documents), (ii) any note, warrant, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license,
contract, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or
any of its subsidiaries is now a party or by which it or any of its properties
or assets may be bound, or (iii) any order, writ, injunction or decree of any
Governmental Entity applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
any of their respective properties or assets, except, in the case of foregoing
clause (ii) or (iii), for violations, breaches or defaults that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, result in any loss, expense, charge,
assessment, levy, fine or other liability being imposed upon or incurred by
the Company or any of its subsidiaries exceeding $50,000.

Section 2.8 No Undisclosed Liabilities; Absence of Changes. Neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature, whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, whether known or

balance sheet of the Company and its subsidiaries (including the notes
thereto), other than (i) liabilities and obligations (A) reflected on the
Company Balance Sheet (including the notes thereto), (B) incurred in
connection with the preparation, execution, delivery 

and performance of this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, or (C)

have been incurred by the Company in the Ordinary Course of Business since the
end of the most recent pay period, and (iv) accrued commissions that have been

of its subsidiaries or (ii) any other employee of, or consultant to, the
Company or any of its subsidiaries whose annual cash compensation is $100,000
or more.

Section 2.9 Litigation. Except as set forth in Section 2.9(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, there are no suits, claims, actions, inquiries,
proceedings, audits or investigations before any Governmental Entity (an
"Action") pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of its or its subsidiaries'
properties or assets. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is
subject to any outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree of any
Governmental Entity that would reasonably be expected to result, individually
or in the aggregate, in any loss, expense, charge, assessment, levy, fine or
other liability being imposed upon or incurred by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries exceeding $25,000. There is no outstanding order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree, determination or award of any Governmental Entity relating
to the Company, any of its subsidiaries, any of their respective properties or
assets, or the Transactions or, to the knowledge of the Company, pending or
threatened investigation by, any Governmental Entity relating to the Company,
any of its subsidiaries, any of their respective properties or assets, any of
their respective officers or directors, or the Transactions. Except as set
forth in Section 2.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no Action
by the Company or any of its subsidiaries pending, or which the Company or any
of its subsidiaries has commenced preparations to initiate, against any other
person.

Section 2.10 Compliance with Applicable Law.

(a) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries currently holds, and has held at
all times, all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals
of all Governmental Entities necessary for the lawful conduct of its business
(collectively, the "Company Permits"), except for failures to hold such
permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, result in any charge, assessment, levy, fine
or other liability being imposed upon or incurred by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries exceeding $25,000. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is in
compliance, and has been in compliance at all times, with the terms of the
Company Permits held by it or to which it is subject, except where the failure
so to comply would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in any
charge, assessment, levy, fine or other liability being imposed upon or
incurred by the Company or any of its subsidiaries exceeding $25,000. No
suspension, cancellation, modification, revocation or nonrenewal of any
Company Permit is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened. No
Company Permit is held 

in the name of any employee, officer, director, stockholder, agent or
otherwise on behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

(b) The business of the Company and each of its subsidiaries is being
conducted, and has at all times been conducted, in compliance with all
applicable statute, law, ordinance, regulation, rule, code, executive order,
injunction, judgment, decree or order of the United States or any foreign
country, or any political subdivision thereof, or of any Governmental Entity
("Laws") except for violations or possible violations of any Laws that do not
and will not result, individually or in the aggregate, in any charge,
assessment, levy, fine or other liability being imposed upon or incurred by
the Company or any of its subsidiaries exceeding $25,000. None of the Company,
any of its subsidiaries or any of its or their executive officers has received
during the past five years, nor is there any known basis for, any notice,
order, complaint or other communication from any Governmental Entity or any
other person that the Company or any of its subsidiaries is not in compliance
in any material respect with any Law applicable to it.

Section 2.11 Employee Benefit Plans; Labor Matters.

(a) Section 2.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists as of the date
hereof all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")), and all bonus,
stock option, stock purchase, incentive, deferred compensation, supplemental
retirement, health, life, or disability insurance, dependent care, severance
and other similar fringe or employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements
and any current or former employment or executive compensation or severance
agreements, written or otherwise, that are sponsored, maintained or
contributed to or required to be contributed to or for which the Company or
any subsidiary of the Company could have any liability (contingent or
otherwise) for the benefit of or relating to any employee or former employee
of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, any trade or business
(whether or not incorporated) that is a member of a controlled group including
the Company or any of its subsidiaries or that is under common control with
the Company or any of its subsidiaries within the meaning of Section 414 of
the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"), as well as each plan with respect to which
the Company or any of its subsidiaries or an ERISA Affiliate could incur
liability under Section 4069 (if such plan has been or were terminated) or
Section 4212(c) of ERISA (together the "Employee Plans"). The Company has made
available to Parent a copy of each Employee Plan and, where applicable, (i)
the two most recent annual reports on Form 5500 (including schedules) filed
with the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") for each Employee Plan where
such report is required, (ii) except as set forth on Section 2.11(a)(ii) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the documents and instruments governing each
such Employee Plan and related funding arrangement including participant
agreements, (iii) the most recent summary plan description and any summaries
of material modifications for each such Employee Plan, and (iv) the most
recent favorable IRS determination letter for each Employee Plan that is
intended to be qualified pursuant to Section 401(a) of the Code.

(b) Except as set forth on Section 2.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
no Employee Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code, and neither the Company, nor any subsidiary of the
Company, nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability (contingent or
otherwise) with respect to any such Employee Plan or any other 

plan or arrangement subject to Title IV of ERISA. Each Employee Plan complies
in all material respects with its terms and complies in form and in operation
in all material respects with applicable law (including ERISA and the Code),
and there has been no violation of any reporting or disclosure requirement
imposed by ERISA or the Code. Each Employee Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified (or is a prototype plan which
has received a favorable opinion letter) and has been determined to be so
qualified by the IRS, and since the date of each most recent determination (if
applicable), there has been no event, condition or circumstance that has
adversely affected or is reasonably likely to adversely affect such qualified
status. No Employee Plan is maintained outside of the United States for the
benefit of employees employed outside of the United States.

(c) No fiduciary or party in interest of any Employee Plan has participated
in, engaged in or been a party to any transaction that is prohibited under
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA and not exempt under Section
4975 of the Code or Section 408 of ERISA, respectively, with respect to which
the Company or its subsidiaries could have any liability. With respect to any
Employee Plan, (i) neither the Company, nor any subsidiary of the Company, nor
any of its ERISA Affiliates has had asserted against it any claim for Taxes
under Chapter 43 of Subtitle D of the Code and Section 5000 of the Code, or
for penalties under ERISA Section 502(c), 502(i) or 502(l), nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, is there a reasonable basis for any such claim, and
(ii) no officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries has committed a breach of any fiduciary responsibility or
obligation imposed by Title I of ERISA. Other than routine claims for
benefits, there is no claim or proceeding (including any audit or
investigation) pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,
involving any Employee Plan by any person, or by the IRS, the United States
Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity against such Employee
Plan or the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate; and no
fact or circumstance exists that would make such a claim or proceeding likely
to occur.

(d) Section 2.11(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list as of
the date hereof of all (i) employment agreements with employees of the Company
or any subsidiary of the Company, (ii) agreements with consultants who are
individuals obligating the Company or any of its subsidiaries to make annual
cash payments in an amount exceeding $50,000 and any agreements pursuant to
which any employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries provides or has
provided in the past consulting or similar services to a Third Party during
the course of employment and with the prior written consent of the Company,
(iii) severance agreements or other agreements, arrangements or policies that
contain post-employment liabilities or obligations, programs and policies of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries with or relating to its respective
employees, except such programs and policies required to be maintained by law,
and (iv) plans, programs, agreements and other arrangements of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries with or relating to its respective employees that
contain change in control provisions whether or not listed in other parts of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company has made available to Parent
copies of all such agreements, plans, programs and other arrangements.

(e) The consummation of the Transactions will not, either alone or in
combination with another event, (i) except as set forth in Section 2.11(e)(i)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, entitle any current or former employee,
consultant or officer of the Company 

or any subsidiary to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other
payment, (ii) except as set forth in Section 2.11(e)(ii) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, accelerate the time of payment, vesting or funding, or
increase the amount of compensation due any such employee, consultant or
officer, except as expressly provided in this Agreement or (iii) except as set
forth in Section 2.11(e)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, cause or
result in a limitation on the right of the Company and its subsidiaries to
amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Employee
Plan or related trust.

(f) All premiums or other payments that are due have been paid with respect to
each such Employee Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan. No Employee
Plan that is a welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of
ERISA provides health or welfare benefits (whether or not insured) to current
or former employees or directors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
its ERISA Affiliates beyond their retirement or other termination of service,
other than pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code or similar state laws, the
full cost of which is borne by the current or former employee or director. The
Company, its subsidiaries and its ERISA Affiliates have complied in all
material respects with the provisions of Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and
Sections 4980B, 9801, 9802, 9811 and 9812 of the Code.

(g) There are no controversies relating to any Employee Plan or other labor
matters pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened between the
Company or any subsidiary of the Company and any of their respective
employees. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to any
collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract applicable to
persons employed by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, and neither
the Company nor any of its subsidiaries knows of any activities or proceedings
of any labor union to organize any such employees. No strikes, work stoppage,
material grievance, claim of unfair labor practice, or dispute against the
Company or any of its subsidiaries has occurred, is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened, and to the knowledge of the Company
there is no basis for any of the foregoing.

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates sponsors or has ever sponsored, maintained, contributed to, or
incurred an obligation to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or to a
Multiple Employer Plan, nor is it reasonably likely that there could be any
liability to a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan pursuant to Title
IV of ERISA. For these purposes, "Multiemployer Plan" means a multiemployer
plan, as defined in Sections 3(37) and 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, and "Multiple
Employer Plan" means any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored by more than one
employer, within the meaning of Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA or Section
413(c) of the Code.

(i) In accordance with applicable law, each Employee Plan can be amended or
terminated by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company at any time, without
consent from any other person and without liability other than for benefits
accrued as of the date of such amendment or termination (other than charges
incurred as a result of such termination). Except as set forth in Section
2.11(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and its subsidiaries
and their respective ERISA Affiliates have made full and timely payment of all
amounts required to be 

contributed or paid as expenses or accrued such payments in accordance with
normal procedures under the terms of each Employee Plan and applicable law.

(j) To the knowledge of the Company, no employee, or group of employees, of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries has any plans to terminate employment
with the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Each of the Company and its
subsidiaries has complied in all material respects with all laws relating to
the employment of labor, including provisions thereof relating to wages,
hours, equal opportunity and collective bargaining, and does not have any
material employee relations problems. All employees classified as exempt from
the overtime provisions of state and federal law have been properly
classified, as have all individuals classified as independent contractors.
There are no wage and hour, wrongful termination or employment discrimination
claims, complaints or charges pending against the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, and to the knowledge of the Company, there is no reasonable
basis for any claim, complaint or charge against the Company or any of its
subsidiaries by any employee or former employee of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries who was terminated prior to the Effective Time and from whom the
Company or such subsidiary did not obtain a release of claims that was
effective and not subject to revocation at the Effective Time.

(k) Section 2.11(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
all salaries, commissions, bonuses, and vacation pay for all services
performed by employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries accrued as of
February 28, 2013, and each of the Company and its subsidiaries has paid in
full to, or accrued for the benefit of, all employees and consultants, all
such payments and compensation, in accordance with applicable Law and the
terms of the Employee Plans, through the date hereof.

(l) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has had or will have any
liability as of the Effective Time to any employee or to any organization or
any other person as a result of the termination of any employee leasing
arrangement.

(m) No "leased employee," as that term is defined in Section 414(n) of the
Code or any other person who is not classified as a common law employee of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, performs services for the Company or any
of its subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate. No person who has been classified
by the Company or any of its subsidiaries as an independent contractor or in
any other non-employee classification (each a "Contingent Worker") is eligible
to participate in, nor does such person participate in, any Employee Plan
subject to ERISA or any plan described in Section 423 of the Code and no
retroactive participation in any Employee Plan would result due to
reclassification of a Contingent Worker as a common law employee of the
Company or any subsidiary of the Company. The exclusion of any Contingent
Worker from any Employee Plan does not cause any Employee Plan which is
intended to be qualified under Code Section 401(a) to lose such qualification,
nor does the exclusion of any Contingent Worker violate the terms of any
Employee Plan.

(n) Each Employee Plan that constitutes in any part a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has been
operated and maintained in operational and documentary compliance with Section
409A of the Code and all IRS guidance promulgated thereunder. 

Section 2.12 Environmental Laws and Regulations.

(a) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has been in compliance with all
applicable United States federal, state, local and foreign laws and
regulations relating to pollution or protection of human health or the
environment (including ambient air, surface water, groundwater, land surface
or subsurface strata) (collectively, "Environmental Laws"), except for non-
compliances that, individually or in the aggregate, would not result in any
loss, expense, charge, assessment, levy, fine or other liability being imposed
upon or incurred by the Company or any of its subsidiaries exceeding $25,000.

(b) To the Company's knowledge, there are no circumstances or conditions
involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries that could reasonably be
expected to result in any claim, liability, investigation, cost or restriction
on the ownership, use or transfer of any real property of which the Company or
any of its subsidiaries is or was the owner or operator pursuant to any
Environmental Law.

(c) There has been no disposal, release or threatened release of any
substance, material or waste that is listed, classified or regulated in any
concentration pursuant to any Environmental Law or which may be the subject of
regulatory action by any Governmental Entity pursuant to any Environmental Law
(a "Hazardous Substance") on, under, in, from or about any property currently
or formerly owned or operated by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or
otherwise related to the operations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
that has resulted or may result in any loss, expense, charge, assessment,
levy, fine or other liability being imposed upon or incurred by the Company or
any of its subsidiaries exceeding $25,000.

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received any notice,
demand, letter, claim or request for information alleging violation by, or
liability of, the Company or any of its subsidiaries under any Environmental
Law, and there are no proceedings, actions, orders, decrees, injunctions or
other written claims or, to the knowledge of the Company, any threatened
actions or claims, relating to or otherwise alleging liability under any
Environmental Law.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has entered into or agreed
to, and is not subject to, any consent decree, order or settlement or other
agreement in any judicial, administrative, arbitral or other similar forum
relating to its compliance with or liability under any Environmental Law.

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has assumed or is required
to make any expenditures, individually or in the aggregate, exceeding $25,000
pursuant to or to comply with any Environmental Law, nor is there any
reasonable basis on which any Governmental Entity or other person could take
any action that would require any such expenditure.

Section 2.13 Taxes.

(a) Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement: 

(i) "Pre-Closing Tax Period" means any Tax Period ending on or before the
Closing Date and the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date.

(ii) "Pre-Closing Taxes" means, without duplication, all Taxes for which the
Company or any of its subsidiaries are or could be liable (A) with respect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period; (B) as a result of being a member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group prior to the
Closing; (C) as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law,
rule or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring
prior to the Closing; or (D) arising out of or resulting from this Agreement,
in each case together with any interest, penalties and additions to Tax with
respect to any of the foregoing and any Losses incurred in connection with any
of the foregoing. In the case of any Straddle Period: (x) any Property Taxes
for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such Property
Taxes for such entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period; and (y) all other Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be determined based on an actual closing of the books used to calculate such
Taxes as if such tax period ended as of the close of business on the Closing
Date (and for such purpose, the Tax Period of any partnership or other pass-
through entity in which the Company holds a beneficial interest shall be
deemed to terminate at such time). In the case of clause (y), exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including
depreciation and amortization deductions computed as if the Closing Date was
the last day of the Straddle Period) shall be allocated between the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the portion of the Straddle
Period thereafter in proportion to the number of days in each such portion.
Pre-Closing Taxes shall be computed without regard to any tax benefits
attributable to items of expense resulting from compensatory payments or other
amounts treated as compensation (including payments with respect to Company
Stock Options, payments with respect to any Shares for which withholding is
required, or amounts treated as compensation by reason of a "disqualifying
disposition" of Shares acquired upon the exercise of ISOs, and payments of
bonuses or severance) in connection with this Agreement or other expenses
arising from this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth above, Pre-Closing Taxes shall not be deemed to include the employer
payroll-related Taxes payable with respect to payments made to employees or
former employees of the Company in consideration for Vested Company Option or
Shares pursuant to this Agreement; it being agreed that 50% of such employer
payroll-related Taxes shall be included in Company Transaction Expenses.

(iv) "Straddle Period" means a Tax Period including and ending after the
Closing Date.

whatsoever, (B) any interest, penalties, fines, additions to tax or additional
amounts imposed by any Governmental Entity in connection with (1) any item
described in clause (A) or (2) the failure to comply with any requirement
imposed with respect to any Tax Returns, (C) any liability for payment of
amounts described in clause (A) or (B) whether as a result of transferee
liability, of being a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or
unitary group for any period, or otherwise through operation of law, and (D)
any liability for the payment of amounts described in the foregoing clause
(A), (B) or (C) as a result of any tax sharing, tax indemnity or tax
allocation agreement or any other express or implied agreement to indemnify
any other person.

(vi) "Tax Law" means any domestic or foreign, federal, state or local statute,
law, ordinance, rule, code, regulation, order, writ, injunction, judgment,
decree or other requirement of any Governmental Entity relating to Taxes.

(vii) "Tax Period" means any period prescribed by any Governmental Entity for
which a Tax Return is required to be filed or a Tax is required to be paid.

(viii) "Tax Return" means any return, declaration, report, statement,
information statement, election, notification or other written information or
document filed or required to be filed with, or submitted to, a Governmental
Entity with respect to Taxes, including any claims for refunds of Taxes and
any schedules, attachments, amendments or supplements of any of the foregoing.

(b) (i) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has timely filed on or before
the applicable Due Date with the appropriate Governmental Entity all Tax
Returns it is required to have filed. All Tax Returns filed by the Company and
its subsidiaries have been properly completed in compliance with applicable
legal requirements and are true, correct and complete, and no such Tax Return
contains, or was required to contain (in order to avoid a penalty, and
determined without regard to the effect of post-filing disclosure), a
disclosure statement under Section 6662 of the Code (or any predecessor
provision or comparable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law).

(ii) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has timely paid all Taxes that
have become due or payable (whether or not shown on a Tax Return) and has
adequately reserved in the Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP for
all Taxes (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) that have accrued but are
not yet due or payable as of the dates thereof. The Company and its
subsidiaries have no liability for Taxes (contingent or otherwise) other than
(A) Taxes incurred since the Company Balance Sheet Date that are reflected as
a liability in the balance sheet included in the Financial Statements as of
December 31, 2012 or (B) Taxes incurred after December 31, 2012 to the extent
incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business in an amount consistent with
amounts paid in comparable prior periods, adjusted only to reflect Ordinary
Course of Business changes in the operations of the Company and its
subsidiaries.

(iii) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has nexus for any Tax
purpose in any jurisdiction other than jurisdictions for which all required
Tax Returns have 

been duly filed, and no claim has been made by a Governmental Entity in a
jurisdiction where the Company or any of its subsidiaries does not file Tax
Returns that the Company or any of such subsidiaries is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction.

(iv) Section 2.13(b)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth (A) a
list of all U.S. federal and material state and local income Tax Returns, and
all material foreign Tax Returns, filed by or on behalf of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries with any jurisdiction for which the applicable statute of
limitations on assessment and collection has not expired and (B) a list of all
jurisdictions in which the Company or its subsidiaries will be required to
file any Tax Return (and the type of Tax Return) following the Closing with
respect to any Tax Period ending on or prior to the Closing or any Straddle
Period. The Company has previously delivered or made available to Parent true,
correct and complete copies of (1) all Tax Returns filed by or on behalf of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries for which the applicable statute of
limitations has not expired, (2) all audit reports, letter rulings, technical
advice memoranda and similar documents issued by a Governmental Entity
relating to Taxes with respect to the Company or its subsidiaries and (3) all
statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by the Company or its
subsidiaries. No election has been made with respect to Taxes of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries that is not reflected in a Tax Return previously
delivered or made available to Parent.

(v) (A) There is no current, pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened claim, demand, cause of action, suit, arbitration, inquiry,
hearing, investigation, request for information or filings, audit,
examination, disputes, proposed adjustment or proceeding (whether

of any and all Liens, and all such Company IPR is fully transferable,
alienable and licensable by the Company (or such subsidiary) and shall be
fully transferable, alienable and licensable by the Surviving Corporation on
and immediately after the Closing, and by Parent, Holdings or any affiliate of
Parent or Holdings on and after any subsequent merger of the Surviving
Corporation into Parent, Holdings or any affiliate of Parent or Holdings. Upon

and, except as a result of any agreements or obligations of Parent existing
immediately prior to the Closing, all of such rights shall be exercisable by
the Surviving Corporation, and by Parent, Holdings or any affiliate of Parent
or Holdings on and after any subsequent merger of the Surviving Corporation
into Parent, Holdings or any affiliate of Parent or Holdings, to the same
extent as by the Company (or a subsidiary of the Company) prior to the

or granted any exclusive license with respect to, any Company IPR or IPR that
was, at the time of transfer, owned by the Company or a subsidiary of the

clear of any and all Liens. Except as set forth on Section 2.14(c)(ii) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company Licensed IPR shall be exercisable by
the Surviving Corporation on and after the Closing, and by Parent, Holdings or
any affiliate of Parent or Holdings on and after any subsequent merger of the
Surviving Corporation into Parent, Holdings or any affiliate of Parent or
Holdings, to the same extent as by the Company and its subsidiaries prior to
the Closing. No loss or expiration of any material Intellectual Property
Rights or Software licensed to the Company or its subsidiaries under any
Inbound License Agreement is pending or reasonably foreseeable or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened. No licensor or other Third Party under
any Inbound License Agreement has any ownership or exclusive license rights in
or with respect to any improvements, enhancements, modifications or derivative
works made by or for the Company or any of its subsidiaries to the
Intellectual Property Rights or Software licensed thereunder.

(iii) No Challenges to Ownership or Licenses. Neither the Company nor any of
its subsidiaries has received any written notice or claim, or, in the past
five years, any oral or other notice or claim (A) challenging the Company's or
any subsidiary of the Company's ownership of the Company IPR (in whole or in
part) or Company Software or asserting that any Third Party has any claim of
legal or beneficial ownership with respect thereto; or (B) except as set forth
on Section 2.14(c)(iii)(B) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, challenging any
license, 

exclusivity or other rights of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company
under any Inbound License Agreement, including any rights granted to Company
or any subsidiary of the Company thereunder with respect to any Company
Licensed IPR or Software. To the knowledge of the Company, there is no
reasonable basis for any such challenge or claim that the Company or any

have the right to exercise any such license, exclusivity or other rights
granted under any Inbound License Agreement.

(iv) Company Registered IPR.

(A) All Company Registered IPR has been: (1) registered or obtained in
accordance with all applicable legal requirements, and is currently in full
force and effect; or (2) in the case of patent applications and trademark
registration applications, filed and is currently pending in accordance with
all applicable legal requirements. The Company (or a subsidiary of the
Company) is the exclusive owner and record holder of title of each item of
Company Registered IPR by virtue of written assignments to the Company (or
such subsidiary of the Company) that have been duly executed and properly and
timely recorded with the applicable Governmental Entities. The Company (or
such subsidiary of the Company) has timely paid all filing, examination,
issuance, post registration and maintenance fees, annuities and the like
associated with or required with respect to any of the Company Registered IPR.

(B) To the knowledge of the Company, all Patents, registered Trademarks,
registered Copyrights and registered Mask Works included in the Company
Registered IPR are valid and enforceable. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has received any notice or claim challenging or questioning the
validity or enforceability or alleging the misuse of any of the Company
Registered IPR. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has taken any
action or failed to take any action, which action or failure reasonably could
be expected to result in the unintentional abandonment, cancellation,
forfeiture, relinquishment, invalidation or unenforceability of any of the
Company Registered IPR. Neither the Company nor any subsidiary of the Company
has committed any illegal tying, illegal term extension, misuse, other illegal
anti-competition activities, laches, estoppel, waiver, inequitable conduct in
violation of 35 C.F.R. 1.56 or other similar law, in each case, that, if
litigated, may result in the unenforceability or invalidity of any Company
Registered IPR. All Trademarks that are Company Registered IPR have been
continuously used in the form appearing in, and in connection with, the goods
and services listed in their respective registration certificates and
applications thereof, respectively.

(C) Except as set forth on Section 2.14(c)(iv)(C) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no Company Registered IPR has been or is now involved in any
interference, reissue, reexamination, entitlement action, opposition,
cancellation, litigation, arbitration or similar proceeding and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no such action is or has been threatened with
respect to any of the Company Registered IPR and, to the knowledge of the
Company, there is no Third Party IPR that, if an appropriate proceeding were
commenced, would be interfering with or render invalid or unenforceable any
Company Registered IPR.

(D) There are no actions that must be taken within 120 days of the Closing
Date, including the payment of any registration, maintenance or renewal fees
or the 

filing of any responses to office actions, documents, applications or
certificates for the purposes of obtaining, maintaining, perfecting or
preserving or renewing any Company Registered IPR. Neither the Company nor any
of its subsidiaries has claimed any status in the application for or
registration of Company Registered IPR, including "small business status,"
that would not be applicable to the Company, its subsidiaries or to the
Surviving Corporation on or after the Closing Date, or to Parent or Holdings.

(v) Actions to Protect Intellectual Property Rights. Each of the Company and
its subsidiaries has taken reasonable steps to protect its rights in the
Company IPR and the Company Licensed IPR and maintain the confidentiality of
all information that constitutes or at any time constituted a Trade Secret of
the Company or a subsidiary of the Company (other than information that lost
its status as a Trade Secret through the issuance by the Company of, or
publication of, Patents or applications therefor). Without limiting the
foregoing, (A) all current and former employees, consultants and contractors
of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company have executed and delivered
written proprietary information, confidentiality and assignment agreements
substantially in the Company's standard form (which has previously been made
available to Parent) and (B) all IPR created or developed by any such current
and former employees, consultants and contractors in the course or scope of
their employment or engagement by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company
(including any inventions that are the subject of any Patents that are
included in the Company Registered IPR) has been assigned to, and is vested
exclusively in, the Company or a subsidiary of the Company pursuant to such
written agreements.

(vi) No Infringement or Unauthorized Use by the Company. None of the Products,
nor any other activities or operations of the Company or any subsidiary of the
Company, have infringed upon, misappropriated, violated, diluted or

vesting and seniority under Parent's non-equity employee benefit plans, to the
extent permitted by applicable law and the terms of such non-equity employee
benefit plans, service with the Company prior to the Closing will be credited

from the Company evidence that the Company Board has adopted resolutions to
terminate the 401(k) plan (the form and substance of which resolutions shall
be subject to review and approval of Parent), effective as of the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date. In the event of such request, the
Company shall also adopt resolutions to amend its 401(k) plan immediately
prior to the Closing to eliminate all forms of distribution upon termination
of such plan other than lump sum distribution. In the event that the Company
is required to terminate its 401(k) plan pursuant to this provision, at the
Effective Time, each employee of the Company or its subsidiaries who will be
continuing 

employment with Parent or its subsidiaries will be eligible to participate in
the cash or deferred arrangement maintained by Parent that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(k) of the Code. Parent shall take all steps
reasonably necessary to permit each such continuing employee who has received
an eligible rollover distribution (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the

breach of any representation or warranty on the part of the Company set forth
in this Agreement or if any such representation or warranty of the Company
shall have become untrue such that the condition set forth in Section 5.3(a)
would be incapable of being satisfied by the Final Date; provided, that 

none of Parent, Holdings or Acquisition Sub has breached any of its
representations and warranties or obligations hereunder in any material
respect; or (ii) there shall have been a breach by the Company of any of its
covenants or agreements hereunder such that the condition set forth in Section
5.3(b) would be incapable of being satisfied by the Final Date, and the
Company has not cured such breach within 10 Business Days after notice by
Parent, Holdings or Acquisition Sub thereof; provided, that none of Parent,
Holdings or Acquisition Sub has breached any of its representations and
warranties or obligations hereunder in any material respect; or

(e) by Parent if the Company has not delivered the Requisite Approval to
Parent within 24 hours after the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

Section 6.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination and
abandonment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no further effect without any liability on the
part of any party hereto or any of its affiliates, directors, officers and
stockholders other than pursuant to Sections 4.5(c) and 6.3 (and such
provisions of Article 8 as would be relevant to effectuating such Sections).
Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall relieve any party from liability
for any breach of this Agreement prior to such termination. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the Confidentiality Agreement and the
Stockholder Agent Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of
this Agreement.

addition to any other remedies that Parent, Holdings, Acquisition Sub or their
affiliates may have as a result of such termination, the Company shall

expenses incurred by either of them, or on their behalf, in connection with
this Agreement, the Merger and the consummation of all of the Transactions
(including fees payable to professional advisors, investment bankers,
accountants and counsel to any of the foregoing).

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(ii), in
addition to any other remedies that the Company may have as a result of such

expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with this Agreement,
the Merger and the consummation of all of the Transactions (including fees and
expenses payable to professional advisors, investment bankers, accountants and
counsel to any of the foregoing).

Section 7.1(b) and 7.1(c) are referred to as the "Special Claims". The parties

negotiation among the parties and that they intend for the time periods to be

time periods set forth in this Section may be shorter than otherwise provided
by law.

Section 7.2 Indemnification Generally.

(a) Subject to Section 7.1, from and after the Effective Time, Parent,
Holdings and the Surviving Corporation, and their respective affiliates,
officers, directors, stockholders, 

shareholders, representatives and agents (collectively, the "Parent
Indemnitees"), shall be indemnified and held harmless by each Escrow Holder
(each an "Indemnifying Party") (severally in accordance with each such
Indemnifying Party's proportional share of the Total Merger Consideration
payable in respect to all Indemnifying Parties and not jointly) from and
against and in respect of any and all Losses resulting from, arising out of,
relating to, imposed upon or incurred by Parent, Holdings, Acquisition Sub,
the Surviving Corporation or any other Parent Indemnitee by reason of:

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the Company's representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement (including the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Updated Disclosure Schedule, other schedules and the Exhibits
hereto, and any certificate furnished to Parent, Holdings, Acquisition Sub or
any other Parent Indemnitee by or on behalf of the Company or any Indemnifying
Party in connection with the Transactions, other than those described in
Section 7.2(a)(iii)), disregarding, and without regard or giving effect to,
any limitations or qualifications thereto, including materiality, Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, dollar "thresholds" and knowledge;

(ii) any breach of or failure to perform or comply with any covenant,
undertaking or other agreement by the Company contained in this Agreement
(which breach or failure to perform or comply occurs prior to the Closing);

(iii) any misrepresentation or inaccuracy in the information contained in the
Capitalization Schedule, the Updated Capitalization Schedule, the Preliminary
Closing Spreadsheet, or the Closing Consideration Spreadsheet or in any
certificate furnished to Parent, Holdings, Acquisition Sub or any other Parent
Indemnitee by or on behalf of the Company or any Indemnifying Party in
connection with any of the foregoing;

(iv) any Company Transaction Expense in excess of the amount of Estimated
Company Transaction Expenses;

(v) payments to holders of Dissenting Shares to the extent such payments, in
the aggregate, exceed the value of the amounts that otherwise would have been
payable pursuant to Section 1.8 upon the exchange of such Dissenting Shares,
plus the amount of expenses incurred by Parent, Holdings, Acquisition Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or any other Parent Indemnitee in connection with any
litigation, arbitration, mediation or settlement of such holders' claims;

(vi) Pre-Closing Taxes (other than Taxes to the extent taken into account as a
liability in the determination of Closing Working Capital as finally
determined pursuant to Section 1.12); or

(vii) any of the matters set forth on Schedule 7.2(a)(vii).

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Losses" means any and all
deficiencies, judgments, settlements, demands, claims, suits, actions or
causes of action, assessments, liabilities, losses, damages (whether direct,
indirect, incidental or consequential), interest, diminution in value, Taxes,
fines, penalties, costs, expenses (including reasonable legal, accounting and
other costs and expenses 

of professionals) incurred in connection with investigating, defending,
settling or satisfying any and all Claims, judgments or appeals, and in
seeking indemnification therefor. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Special Losses" means any and all Losses resulting from, arising out of,
relating to, imposed upon or incurred by Parent, Holdings, Acquisition Sub,
the Surviving Corporation or any other Parent Indemnitee by reason of, a
Special Claim (for the avoidance of doubt, Special Losses include Special IP
Losses). For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Special IP Losses" means
any and all Losses resulting from, arising out of, relating to, imposed upon
or incurred by Parent, Holdings, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
any other Parent Indemnitee by reason of, a Special IP Claim. For purposes of
calculating the amount of a particular Loss, such calculation will be made
disregarding, and without giving effect to, (A) any materiality, knowledge,
dollar threshold or Material Adverse Effect on the Company qualification or
(B) any Updated Disclosure Schedule. No waiver of a closing condition by
Parent, Holdings or Acquisition Sub shall limit their rights under this
Article 7. In addition, any investigation conducted or knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) by or on behalf of Parent, Holdings or Acquisition
Sub or any of their affiliates at any time, whether before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, shall not
constitute a waiver or limitation of the right of any Parent Indemnitee to
enforce any indemnification rights hereunder with respect to the accuracy or
inaccuracy of or compliance with, any representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation contained in this Agreement.

(b) Any claims for indemnification hereunder must be set forth in writing,
contain a reasonably detailed description of the nature of and the events or
circumstances underlying the claim for indemnification hereunder and be
received by the Stockholder Agent no later than 10 Business Days following the
expiration of the applicable Survival Period (an "Indemnification Claim") for
claims arising prior to such expiration of the Survival Period. No Parent
Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder for any Losses
arising from a breach of a representation or warranty of the Company until the
aggregate amount of all Losses under all claims of all Parent Indemnitees,
without duplication, for all such breaches shall exceed $2,000,000 (the
"Threshold"), at which time all Losses incurred shall be subject to
indemnification hereunder in full, including the amount of the Threshold;
provided, however, that any Indemnification Claim for Special Losses shall be
indemnifiable in full without regard to the Threshold and indemnification for
any Special Loss shall count towards the Threshold.

(c) The obligations of the Indemnifying Parties under this Section 7.2 shall
not be reduced, offset, eliminated or subject to contribution by reason of any
action or inaction by the Company that contributed to any inaccuracy or breach
giving rise to such obligation, it being understood that the Indemnifying
Parties, and not the Company or the Surviving Corporation, shall have the sole
obligation for the indemnity obligations under this Section 7.2.

(d) The determination of whether there has been a breach of a representation
or warranty in Section 2.13 (Taxes), or other representation or warranty with
respect to Taxes, and the extent of any Losses arising therefrom, shall be
made without regard to any disclosures made in the Company Disclosure
Schedule. No Losses shall be paid pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(vi) in respect of
Pre-Closing Taxes to the extent such Pre-Closing Taxes were withheld pursuant
to Section 1.10(b) or Section 8.12. 

(e) Each Indemnification Claim shall be made only in accordance with this
Article 7 and the Escrow Agreement.

Section 7.3 Escrow Arrangements. At the Effective Time, Parent, Holdings, the
Company, the Stockholder Agent and the Escrow Agent shall enter into an escrow
agreement, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit D with such
modifications and revisions as may be reasonably required by the Escrow Agent
upon its review of such agreement following the date hereof (the "Escrow
Agreement"), and Parent, on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, shall cause
to be retained from the Total Merger Consideration and deposited with Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A., or such other bank or trust company designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company, as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"),
into such accounts with the Escrow Agent as is established by the Escrow
Agreement the Escrow Amount (the "Escrow Fund") and the Reserve Amount (the
"Reserve Fund"), each of such Escrow Amount and such Reserve Amount to be held
and released by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement
and this Agreement. The Escrow Fund, together with all interest and other
income thereon, shall be available to the Parent Indemnitees to satisfy their
claims for indemnification by the Indemnifying Parties hereunder; provided,
however, that the Surviving Corporation may not recover amounts from the
Escrow Fund unless and until Indemnification Claim(s) identifying Losses in
the aggregate exceeding the Threshold or not subject to the Threshold have
been delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Stockholder Agent, as provided in
the Escrow Agreement, and the conditions in the Escrow Agreement for the
disbursement of such amounts from the Escrow Fund to the Surviving Corporation
have been satisfied.

Section 7.4 Stockholder Agent.

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, immediately and automatically upon
Requisite Approval of this Agreement, and without any further action on the
part of any Indemnifying Party, each Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to
have consented to the appointment of Shareholder Representative Services LLC
as his, her or its representative and the attorney-in-fact for and on behalf
of each such Indemnifying Party, and the taking by the Stockholder Agent of
any and all actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted to
be taken by it under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, including the
exercise of the power to (i) authorize delivery to Holdings of the Escrow
Fund, or any portion thereof in satisfaction of Indemnification Claims; (ii)
agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of and comply with
orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such
Indemnification Claims; (iii) resolve any Indemnification Claims; and (iv)
take all actions necessary in the judgment of the Stockholder Agent for the
accomplishment of the foregoing and all of the other terms, conditions and
limitations of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(b) Accordingly, the Stockholder Agent shall have unlimited authority and
power to act on behalf of each Indemnifying Party with respect to this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the disposition, settlement or other
handling of all Indemnification Claims, or other rights or obligations arising
from and taken pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The
Indemnifying Parties will be bound by all actions taken by the Stockholder
Agent in connection with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and Parent
and Holdings shall be entitled to rely 

on any action or decision of the Stockholder Agent. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Agent will constitute a decision of all of the Indemnifying
Parties with respect to whom a portion of the Escrow Fund is held by the
Escrow Agent and will be final, binding and conclusive upon each of such
Indemnifying Parties, and Parent, Holdings and the Escrow Agent may rely upon
any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Agent as
being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every such
Indemnifying Party. Each of Parent, Holdings and the Escrow Agent is hereby
relieved from any liability to any person for any decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholder Agent and for any acts done by Parent, Holdings
and the Escrow Agent in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholder Agent.

(c) The Stockholder Agent will incur no liability with respect to any action
taken or suffered by it in reliance upon any notice, direction, instruction,
consent, statement or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have
been signed by the proper person (and shall have no responsibility to
determine the authenticity thereof), nor for any other action or inaction,
except its own willful misconduct or gross negligence. In all questions
arising under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the Stockholder Agent
may rely on the advice of counsel, and the Stockholder Agent will not be
liable to anyone for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the
Stockholder Agent based on such advice. The Stockholder Agent will not be
required to take any action involving any expense unless the payment of such
expense is made or provided for in a manner satisfactory to it. The
Indemnifying Parties will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Stockholder
Agent from and against any and all loss, liability, damage, claim, penalty,
fine, forfeiture, action, fee, cost and expense (including the fees and
expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document
location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "Agent Losses") arising out
of or in connection with the Stockholder Agent's execution and performance of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, in each case as such Agent Loss is
suffered or incurred; provided, however, that in the event that any such Agent
Loss is finally adjudicated to have been primarily caused by the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Stockholder Agent, the Stockholder
Agent will reimburse the Indemnifying Parties the amount of such indemnified
Agent Loss attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not
paid directly to the Stockholder Agent by the Indemnifying Parties, any such
Agent Losses may be recovered by the Stockholder Agent from (i) the funds in
the Reserve Fund and (ii) subject to the satisfaction of all outstanding
Indemnification Claims, the amounts in the Escrow Fund at such time as
remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Indemnifying Parties
in accordance with the Escrow Agreement; provided, however, that while this
Section allows the Stockholder Agent to be paid from the Reserve Fund and the
Escrow Fund, this Section does not relieve the Indemnifying Parties from their
obligation to promptly pay such Agent Losses as they are suffered or incurred,
nor does it prevent the Stockholder Agent from seeking any remedies available
to it at law or otherwise; provided, further, that in order to make a claim
for any such recovery from the Escrow Fund, the Stockholder Agent shall
deliver a written notice to Parent, Holdings, the Surviving Corporation and
the Escrow Agent in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Escrow
Agreement, and, if required by law or any of Parent, Holdings, the Surviving
Corporation or the Escrow Agent, an accurately completed W-9 or W-8BEN for the
applicable vendor retained by the Stockholder Agent and any other documents
reasonably requested by Parent, Holdings, the Surviving Corporation or the
Escrow Agent; provided, further, that the Stockholder Agent shall also provide
to Parent, 

Holdings and the Surviving Corporation, with such written notice in connection
with a claim for recovery from the Escrow Fund, an invoice showing the fees
and expenses for the services performed.

(d) Subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, at any time, Escrow Holders
having a majority of the Recovery Percentage (the "Majority Escrow Holders")
may, and if the Stockholder Agent resigns, ceases to perform its duties in
connection herewith or dies, the Majority Escrow Holders shall, appoint a new
Stockholder Agent by written consent by sending to Parent, Holdings, the
Surviving Corporation and the Escrow Agent notice and a copy of the written
consent appointing such new Stockholder Agent signed by the Majority Escrow
Holders. Such appointment will be effective upon the later of the date
indicated in the consent or the date such consent is received by Parent,
Holdings, the Surviving Corporation and the Escrow Agent.

Section 7.5 Third-Party Claims.

(a) If any Third Party provides written notice to Parent or any of its
affiliates or any other Parent Indemnitee with respect to any written claim
(hereinafter referred to as a "Third Party Claim"), which Parent believes in
good faith, may give rise to an Indemnification Claim by Parent against the
Escrow Fund, then Parent shall give notice to the Stockholder Agent within 30
days after Parent has received any such Third Party Claim setting forth such
material information with respect to the Third Party Claim as is reasonably
available to Parent; provided, however, that no delay or failure on the part
of Parent in notifying the Stockholder Agent shall relieve the Stockholder
Agent and the Indemnifying Parties from their obligations hereunder unless the
Stockholder Agent and the Indemnifying Parties are thereby materially
prejudiced (and then solely to the extent of such material prejudice).

(b) In case any Third Party Claim is asserted against Parent, Holdings or any
of its affiliates or any other Parent Indemnitee, the Stockholder Agent may,
if the Stockholder Agent so elects by written notice delivered to Parent
within 14 days after receiving Parent's notice of such claim, assume the
defense thereof, at the sole expense of the Indemnifying Parties, independent
of the then-remaining Escrow Fund, unless:

(i) Parent has reasonably determined that Losses which may be incurred as a
result of the Third Party Claim may exceed, either individually or when
aggregated with all other actual or anticipated Third Party Claims, the total
dollar value of the Escrow Fund;

(ii) the Third Party Claim does not involve only money damages and could (A)
involve an injunction or other equitable relief, (B) involve any criminal or
quasi-criminal allegations or proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation against Parent, the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any of
their respective employees or affiliates, (C) relate to or arise in connection
with intellectual property rights of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
or (D) involve a customer or supplier of Parent, Holdings, the Company or any
of its subsidiaries;

(iii) settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect to, the Third Party
Claim could, in the good-faith judgment of Parent, establish a precedential
custom or practice 

materially adverse to the continuing business interests of Parent, Holdings,
the Surviving Corporation or any other Parent Indemnitee;

(iv) under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any
significant issue may exist between the Parent Indemnitees and the
Indemnifying Parties in respect of the Third Party Claim; or

(v) Stockholder Agent does not (A) agree, on behalf of the Indemnifying
Parties, that the Indemnifying Parties shall be fully responsible for all
Losses relating to such Third Party Claim and (B) provide reasonable assurance
to Parent of the financial capacity of the Indemnifying Parties (taking into
account Stockholder Agent's rights pursuant to Section 7.4(c)) to prosecute
the defense actively and diligently.

(c) If the Stockholder Agent is permitted to assume any such defense, the
Stockholder Agent shall conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively
and diligently. The Stockholder Agent shall not compromise or settle such
Third Party Claim or consent to entry of any judgment in respect thereof
without the prior written consent of Parent and/or any other Parent
Indemnitees, as applicable, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.

(d) In the event that the Stockholder Agent assumes the defense of the Third
Party Claim in accordance with Section 7.5(b), Parent, Holdings or any other
Parent Indemnitee may retain separate counsel and participate in the defense
of the Third Party Claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be
at the expense of Parent or Holdings, unless Parent, Holdings or such Parent
Indemnitees shall reasonably determine that (i) there is a conflict of
interest between or among Parent, Holdings or the Parent Indemnitees, on the
one hand, and the Stockholder Agent and the Indemnifying Parties, on the other
hand, or (ii) the Stockholder Agent has failed to vigorously prosecute or
defend, with respect to such Third Party Claim, in which case the reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel will be paid out of the Escrow Fund. Parent
and Holdings will, at the Indemnifying Parties' expense, cooperate in the
defense of the Third Party Claim and will provide full access to documents,
assets, properties, books and records reasonably requested by the Stockholder
Agent and material to the claim and will make available all officers,
directors and employees reasonably requested by the Stockholder Agent for
investigation, depositions and trial.

(e) If the Stockholder Agent fails or elects not to assume the defense of
Parent or its affiliates or any other Parent Indemnitee against such Third
Party Claim, which Stockholder Agent had the right to assume under Section
7.5(b), Parent, Holdings or any other Parent Indemnitee shall have the right
to undertake the defense and Parent and Holdings shall not compromise or
settle such Third Party Claim or consent to entry of any judgment in respect
thereof without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Agent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the Stockholder
Agent is not entitled to assume the defense of Parent, Holdings or other
Parent Indemnitees against such Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 7.5(b),
Parent, Holdings or the Parent Indemnitees shall have the right to undertake
the defense, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
with respect to the Third Party Claim in any manner it may deem appropriate
(and Parent, Holdings or Parent Indemnitees need not consult with, or obtain
any consent from, the Stockholder Agent in connection therewith); provided,
however, that, except with the written consent of the Stockholder Agent, no
settlement of any such claim or consent to entry 

of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim shall alone be
determinative of the validity of the Third Party Claim against the Escrow Fund
or personally against the Indemnifying Parties. In each case, Parent, Holdings
or the Parent Indemnitees shall conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim
actively and diligently, and the Stockholder Agent will cooperate with Parent,
Holdings or Parent Indemnitees, and the Stockholder Agent and the Indemnifying
Parties will cooperate in the defense of that claim and the Stockholder Agent
will provide full access to documents, assets, properties, books and records
in its possession reasonably requested by Parent and material to the claim and
will make available all individuals within its control reasonably requested by
Parent for investigation, depositions and trial.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder Agent shall not be entitled
to control any Third Party Claim relating to Taxes of Parent, Holdings, the
Surviving Corporation or the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and shall not
be entitled to settle, either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any claim for Taxes which could, in each case, as determined in
Parent's reasonable discretion, adversely affect the liability of Parent,
Holdings or the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries for Taxes for any
period (or portion thereof) after the Closing Date by more than a de minimis
amount, without the prior written consent of Parent.

Section 7.6 Limits on Recovery.

(a) With respect to all Losses: (i) each Indemnifying Party shall be
severally, in the same proportion as such Indemnifying Party's Recovery
Percentage, and not jointly, liable for the amount of any Losses, except to
the extent such liability is limited pursuant to this Section 7.6; and (ii)
the Parent Indemnitees may seek recovery for any Losses directly from the
Indemnifying Parties only after proceeding against the Escrow Fund.

(b) With respect to Losses that are not Special Losses (the "Ordinary
Losses"), the aggregate maximum liability of the Indemnifying Parties
(excluding any amounts payable pursuant to the Stockholder Agent's rights
under Section 7.4(c)) shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) 12.5% multiplied
by (ii) the Base Cash Amount.

(c) With respect to Special IP Losses, the aggregate maximum liability of the
Indemnifying Parties (excluding any amounts payable pursuant to the
Stockholder Agent's rights under Section 7.4(c)), when taken together with any
Ordinary Losses, shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) 20% multiplied by
(ii) the Base Cash Amount.

(d) With respect to all Special Losses (except for Special IP Losses that are
subject to Section 7.6(c)), the aggregate maximum liability of the
Indemnifying Parties (excluding any amounts payable pursuant to the
Stockholder Agent's rights under Section 7.4(c)), when taken together with any
Special IP Losses and any Ordinary Losses, shall not exceed an amount equal to
the Base Cash Amount.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except as provided in
Section 7.6(c), in the event and to the extent the Parent Indemnitees recover
any Special Losses from the Escrow Fund, the amount of such recovery shall not
reduce or limit the amount that the Parent Indemnitees would otherwise be
entitled to recover from the Indemnifying Parties in respect 

of Ordinary Losses the Indemnification Claims for which are made prior to the
day that is 10 Business Days following the expiration of the applicable
Survival Period.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of (i) any
right to specific performance or injunctive relief or (ii) any right or
remedy, including money damages in excess of the Escrow Fund and the Total
Merger Consideration, arising by reason of any claim of fraud or willful
misrepresentation with respect to this Agreement, the Transaction Agreements
or the Transactions.
