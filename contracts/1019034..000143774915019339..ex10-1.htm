investment. Such Purchaser understands any statement contained in the Company

part of the normal prosecution process prior to issuance), opposition, action,
suit, investigation or proceeding, from or by a person (including, without
limitation, a customer, a supplier, an employee, a consultant or an
independent contractor of the Company or any of its subsidiaries) as to title,
validity, enforceability, entitlement, misappropriation, or infringement of
any intellectual property or other proprietary rights of any third party or
otherwise that prohibits or restricts the Company or any of its subsidiaries
from carrying on its business, or any portion of it, in the jurisdiction where

breach of the agreement, which breach could lead to a termination, suspension
or revocation of such agreement and which would cause a Material Adverse
Effect, and to the knowledge of the Company, no circumstances exist which,
would give rise to any breach of any such agreement or to any such agreement
being terminated, suspended, significantly varied or revoked without the
Company or the relevant subsidiary's consent and if terminated, would cause a
Material Adverse Effect (other than termination without cause upon notice in
accordance with the terms of the agreement). (viii) The ownership, license or
rights in the Group IP owned by the Company or any of its subsidiaries will

(g) _Independent Nature of Purchasers ' Obligations and Rights_. The
obligations of each Purchaser under any Transaction Document and the
obligations of World Wide Touch Technology (Holdings) Limited, a limited
liability company incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability ("
_WWTT_ "), contemplated under that certain draft Securities Purchase Agreement
with the Company (the " _SPA_ ") are several and not joint with the
obligations of any other Purchaser and no Purchaser shall be responsible in
any way for the performance or non-performance of the obligations of any other
Purchaser under any Transaction Document or of WWTT under the SPA in the event
it is executed. Nothing contained herein or in any other Transaction Document
or the SPA, and no action taken by any Purchaser pursuant hereto or thereto,
or WWTT pursuant to the SPA shall be deemed to constitute the Purchasers
and/or WWTT as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other
kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Purchasers and WWTT are in
any way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations, the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents or the SPA, or the
voting or disposition of shares of Common Stock or other shares of capital
stock of the Company. Each Purchaser shall be entitled to independently
protect and enforce its rights, including, without limitation, the rights
arising out of this Agreement or out of the other Transaction Documents, and
it shall not be necessary for any other Purchaser or WWTT to be joined as an
additional party in any proceeding for such purpose. The Company has elected
to provide all Purchasers with the same terms and Transaction Documents for
the convenience of the Company and not because it was required or requested to
do so by any of the Purchasers. It is expressly understood and agreed that
each provision contained in this Agreement and in each other Transaction
Document is between the Company and a Purchaser, solely, and not between the
Company and the Purchasers collectively, and not among the Company, the
Purchasers collectively, and WWTT, and not between or among the Purchasers,
individually or collectively, and WWTT. No Purchaser shall act in concert, as
a group, or together with any other Purchaser or WWTT with regard to any vote
of the stockholders of the Company.

 



 

 



   



 

6. _Subsequent Investments._

 



 

(a) The Company may raise additional capital investment from third parties

preferred stock to such Additional Investors (the " _Subsequent Investment_
"); provided that, prior to the Subsequent Investment, the Company shall make
an offer to each Purchaser and the holders of any Preferred Shares acquired
from any Purchaser (collectively, the " _Holders_ " and individually, a "
_Holder_ " ) in accordance with the provisions of Sections 6(b) and 6(c) (the
" _Proposed Issuance Offer_ ") such that each Holder shall be entitled to
purchase up to such number of newly issued securities based on their
respective shareholding percentage in the Company calculated on a fully
diluted basis by full payment in cash equal to the per share price to be paid
by the Additional Investors and on the same terms and conditions to be offered
by the Company to the Additional Investors.

 



 

(b) At least thirty (30) days before the proposed Subsequent Investment
(the " _Proposed Issuance_ "), the Company shall deliver to each of the
Holders a written notice of the Proposed Issuance. Such notice shall state (i)
the quantity, type and terms of such issuance of securities; (ii) the
consideration which the Company will receive from the Proposed Issuance; (iii)
the identity of the Additional Investors; and (iv) the terms of the Proposed
Issuance Offer, including the calculation of such Holder's shareholding
percentage in the Company calculated on a fully diluted basis before and
immediately following the Proposed Issuance.

 



 

(c) Within twenty (20) days from the delivery of the notice set forth in
Section 6(b) (the " _New Issuance Offer Period_ "), each Holder who elects to
exercise its right in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6(c)
shall give a written notice to the Company. Such notice shall specify the
number of securities to be purchased by the Holder and the calculation of such
Holder's shareholding percentage in the Company calculated on a fully diluted
basis. Where any Holder fails to give a notice within the New Issuance Offer
Period, such Holder shall be deemed to have waived its right in relation to
the Proposed Issuance under this Section 6, and the Company may issue the
relevant securities not accepted by such Holder to other third parties on
terms which are not more favorable than the terms on which they were offered
to the Holders.

 



 

7. _Confidentiality_. 

 



 

(a) Each of the Purchasers acknowledges and agrees that: (i) certain of
the information contained herein is of a confidential nature and may be
regarded as material non-public information under Regulation FD of the
Securities Act; (ii) except as provided in Section 7(b), this Agreement and

other than its personal financial and legal advisors for the sole purpose of
evaluating the entering into and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated under the Transaction Documents, and such Purchaser will not,
directly or indirectly, disclose or permit its personal financial and legal
advisors to disclose, any of such information without the prior written
consent of the Company; (iv) such Purchaser shall make its representatives
aware of the terms of this Section 7 and be responsible for any breach of this
Agreement by such representatives; (v) except as provided in Section 7(b),

release to trade publications or the press with respect to the contents or
subject matter of this Agreement; and (vi) if such Purchaser decides to not
pursue further investigation of the Company or to not participate in the
Offering, such Purchaser will promptly return this Agreement and any
accompanying documentation to the Company.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Any Party may disclose, or permit the disclosure of, information which
would otherwise be confidential if and to the extent (i) required by law or
any securities exchange, regulatory or governmental body, (ii) disclosed to

advisers or officers on a need-to-know basis (but it shall remain responsible

into the public domain other than as a result of a breach by any party hereto.

 



 

8. _Non-Public Information_. Each Purchaser acknowledges that certain information concerning the matters that are the subject matter of this Agreement constitute material non-public information under United States federal securities laws, and that United States federal securities laws prohibit any person who has received material non-public information relating to the Company from purchasing or selling securities of the Company, or from communicating such information to any person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell securities of the Company. Accordingly, until such time as any such non-public information has been adequately disseminated to the public, each Purchaser shall not purchase or sell any securities of the Company, or communicate such information to any other person save as provided in Section 7(b).

 



 

9. _Sales and Confidentiality After The Date Hereof_. Each Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to, engage, directly or indirectly, in any transactions in the securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any Short Sales (as such term is defined in Rule 200 promulgated under Regulation SHO under the Exchange Act)) during the period from the date hereof until such time as (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are first publicly announced or (ii) this Agreement is terminated. Each Purchaser understands and acknowledges, severally and not jointly with any other Purchaser, that the SEC currently takes the position that covering a short position established prior to effectiveness of a resale registration statement with shares included in such registration statement would be a violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act, as set forth in the SEC's Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 239.10.

 



 

 



   



 

10. _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereto, and no party shall be liable or bound to any other party in any manner by any warranties, representations, guarantees or covenants except as specifically set forth in this Agreement. Each Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it did not rely upon any statements or information, whether oral or written, provided by the Company, or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives, in deciding to enter into this Agreement or purchase the Shares. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto or their respective successors and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument or instruments in writing signed by the Company and the holders of a majority of the Shares sold in the Offering. No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

 



 

13. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not assign its rights or delegate its obligations under this Agreement without the express prior written consent of the Purchaser. Except as provided in Section 6, nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer upon any person not a party hereto (and their successors and assigns) any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

14. _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_.

All covenants and agreements contained herein which by their terms contemplate actions following the Closing shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.
