   2.6 | _Purchase Price._ 
---|--- 

The aggregate consideration for the Purchased Assets payable at Closing shall
be (i) an amount equal to five billion eight hundred million dollars
($5,800,000,000), which shall be paid by Scotland to the Vendors jointly (the
"Cash Consideration"), plus (ii) the amount of the Assumed Liabilities,
(collectively, and as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.7, the "Purchase
Price"). At Closing, Scotland shall assume the Assumed Liabilities and pay an
amount equal to the Cash Consideration in immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by Parent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if, at any time prior to Closing, the Parties agree that it is
reasonable in the circumstances for a portion of the Cash Consideration to be
paid to Parent instead of being paid to the Vendors, then (i) such portion of
the Cash Consideration shall be paid to Parent instead of to the Vendors, and
(ii) this Agreement shall be amended to the extent (if any) necessary to give
effect to the change described in foregoing clause (i).



   2.7 | _Net Working Capital Adjustment_ 
---|--- 



   (a) |

Within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver,
or cause to be prepared and delivered, to Scotland a statement (the "Parent
Net Working Capital Statement") setting forth Parents calculation of the Net
Working Capital and the components thereof calculated and prepared in
accordance with the Working Capital Procedures. Scotland shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with Parent, Vendors and their
representatives in connection with the preparation of the Parent Net Working
Capital Statement, including by providing to Parent, Vendors and their
representatives reasonable access to the Books and Records, work papers,
employees 

---|--- 
 



\- 20 -  employees of Scotland and its Affiliates to cooperate in all reasonable
respects with Parent, Vendors and their representatives in connection with
their review of such Books and Records, work papers and other documents and
information relating to the calculation of the Net Working Capital, in each
case, as Parent shall reasonably request. 
---|--- 
 



   (b) | If Scotland disagrees with Parents calculation of the Net
Working Capital set forth in the Parent Net Working Capital Statement,
Scotland shall promptly, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after
receiving the Parent Net Working Capital Statement (the "Review Period")
deliver to Parent written notice describing in reasonable detail those items
or amounts as to which Scotland disagrees, together with Scotlands
determination of such disputed items and amounts (a "Dispute Notice"). Unless
Scotland delivers a Dispute Notice to Parent on or prior to the expiration of
the Review Period, Scotland will be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the
Parent Net Working Capital Statement and such statement will be final, binding
and conclusive on the Parties (and, in any event, Scotland shall be deemed to
have accepted and agreed to any items not affirmatively disputed in the
Dispute Notice, and all such items shall be final, binding and conclusive on
all Parties except to the extent those items not affirmatively disputed are
affected by the subsequent resolution of any items disputed in the Dispute
Notice in which case the resolution shall resolve such other items as well).
If Scotland delivers to Parent a Dispute Notice within the Review Period,
Parent and Scotland shall, within thirty (30) days following delivery of such
Dispute Notice by Scotland to Parent (the "Resolution Period"), attempt in
good faith to resolve any differences with respect to the disputed items (or
calculations) specified in the Dispute Notice (the "Disputed Items"). Any
resolution by Parent and Scotland during the Resolution Period as to any
Disputed Item shall be set forth in writing and will be final, binding and
conclusive. 
---|--- 
 



   (c) |

If Scotland and Parent are not able to resolve all Disputed Items within the
Resolution Period, then the remaining Disputed Items shall be
submitted immediately following the expiration of the Resolution Period to an
internationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually agreed upon by
Parent and Scotland (the "Accounting Firm"). If any remaining Disputed Items
are submitted to the Accounting Firm for resolution, each of Scotland and
Parent will be afforded an opportunity to present to the Accounting Firm any
materials relating to the determination of the Disputed Items and to discuss
such matters with the Accounting Firm (provided that no ex parte
communications shall be permitted). The Accounting Firm shall act as an expert
and not as an arbitrator to calculate, based solely on the written submissions
of Scotland, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other, and not by
independent investigation, the Net Working Capital as of the Closing and shall
be instructed that its calculation with respect to each remaining Disputed
Item must be within the range of values established for such amount
as determined by reference to the value assigned to such amount by Scotland
in the Dispute Notice and by Parent in the Parent Net Working Capital
Statement, and otherwise in accordance with the Working Capital Procedures.
Each of Scotland and Parent shall give, and cause its Affiliates to give, the
Accounting Firm reasonable access to all documents, records, work papers,
facilities and personnel as reasonably necessary to perform its function as
contemplated by this Section 2.7(c). The Accounting Firm shall submit such
calculation to Parent and Scotland as soon as practicable, but in any event
within thirty (30) days after any remaining Disputed Items are submitted to
the Accounting Firm. The determination by the Accounting Firm of the Net
Working Capital as of the Closing as set forth in a written notice delivered
to Scotland and Parent by the Accounting Firm in accordance with this
Agreement will be binding and conclusive on all Parties absent manifest error.
The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be 

---|--- 
 



\- 21 -  aggregate amount of deviation of the amount of the Disputed Item(s) as set
forth in the Dispute Notice and the Net Working Capital set forth in the
Parent Net Working Capital Statement from the determination of the Final Net
Working Capital made by the Accounting Firm. The final, binding and conclusive
calculation of Net Working Capital as of the Closing based either upon
agreement or deemed agreement by Parent and Scotland in accordance with
Section 2.7(b) or the written determination delivered by the Accounting Firm
in accordance with this Section 2.7(c), will be the "Final Net Working
Capital" for all purposes of this Agreement. 
---|--- 



   (d) | Within five (5) Business Days of the determination of the Final
Net Working Capital pursuant to this Section 2.7: 
---|--- 
 



     | (i) | if the Final Net Working Capital exceeds the Target Net
Working Capital (the amount of such excess, the "Working Capital Excess"),
then Scotland shall pay, or cause to be paid, to London in cash the amount,
if any, by which (x) the Working Capital Excess exceeds (y) $25,000,000, in
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
Parent; or  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | if the Final Net Working Capital is less than the Target
Net Working Capital (the amount of such deficiency, the "Working Capital
Shortfall"), then London shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Scotland in cash
the amount, if any, by which (x) the Working Capital Shortfall exceeds (y)
$25,000,000, in immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Scotland.  
---|---|--- 



   2.8 | _Transfer Taxes._ 
---|--- 

The Purchase Price is exclusive of any applicable GST, value added, sales,
transfer, use, environmental, excise and other similar Taxes ("Transfer
Taxes"). Subject to Sections 2.9 and 2.10, Purchaser shall be responsible for
all Transfer Taxes applicable to, or resulting from the Transactions.
Purchaser shall (i) self-assess all applicable GST in respect of the sale of
Real Property and any other applicable assets including the assigned leases
and the other fixtures pursuant to subsections 221(2) and 228(4) of the
Excise Tax Act (Canada), (ii) self-assess and remit to the appropriate
Governmental Entity applicable Canadian PST payable in respect of the
Purchased Assets and will provide evidence of such self-assessment to the
appropriate Vendor; (iii) pay all other applicable Transfer Taxes in respect
of the transfer of the Purchased Assets directly to the applicable
Governmental Entity when required; and (iv) in the event that any Transfer
Taxes are required to be paid or become payable to a Vendor then such
Transfer Taxes shall be paid to that Vendor at least five (5) days prior to
when such Transfer Taxes are required to be remitted by the applicable Vendor.
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold the Vendors harmless from and against, and
will reimburse the Vendors for, any Transfer Taxes, penalties and interest
assessed against or payable by a Vendor to the extent such Transfer Taxes are
payable in connection with the disposition of the Purchased Assets, and this
indemnity shall survive until ninety (90) days after the relevant Governmental
Entity shall no longer be entitled to assess or reassess such Transfer Taxes
against the applicable Vendor. For greater certainty, Scotland shall not be
responsible for any Transfer Taxes which the Vendors are entitled to recover
by means of a refund or by means of an input tax credit.



   2.9 | _GST Section 167 Election._ 
---|--- 

If applicable, at Closing, Purchaser and each applicable Vendor shall execute
jointly an election under section 167 of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) to have
the sale of the Purchased Assets take place on a GST-free basis and Purchaser
shall file such election with its GST return for the

 



\- 22 -   reporting period in which the sale of the Purchased Assets takes place.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless each Vendor, its officers, directors and
controlling persons in respect of any GST, penalties, interest and other
amounts which may be assessed against any Vendor as a result of the
Transactions not being eligible for such election or as a result of
Purchasers failure to file the election within the prescribed time.



   2.10 | _Tax Exemption Certificates._ 
---|--- 

For any Canadian PST jurisdiction in which the Purchased Assets are located,
Purchaser will provide a Purchase Exemption Certificate (or its equivalent in
Saskatchewan and Manitoba when required) to the Vendors on Closing, claiming
exemption from Canadian PST for such jurisdiction on the basis that the
Inventory is purchased for resale and/or the Purchased Assets are otherwise
exempt from Canadian PST.



   2.11 | _Reimbursement of Non-Income Tax Liabilities or Refunds._ 
---|--- 

The parties shall mutually cooperate in good faith in calculating and paying
the applicable reimbursement amount payable by the Vendors or Purchaser in
connection with non-income Tax liabilities or refunds of the Vendors at the
Effective Time. Within thirty (30) days of the Closing Date, the Vendors shall
prepare and deliver to Purchaser written notice and supporting documentation
setting out: (i) the Vendors aggregate net liability for remittance of non-
income Taxes at the Effective Time that was assumed by Purchaser under Section
2.3(ix); or (ii) the Vendors aggregate net refund owing in respect of non-
income Taxes at the Effective Time that was acquired by Purchaser under
Section 2.1(n), as applicable. Purchaser shall send written confirmation of
the reimbursement amount within fourteen (14) days of delivery and receipt of
such notice, unless Purchaser disputes the reimbursement amount, in which
case the parties shall follow the procedure for dispute resolution set out in
Section 6.10(d). Reimbursement for such amounts shall be paid by Purchaser or
the Vendors, as applicable, within seven (7) days of delivery and receipt of
Purchasers written confirmation of the reimbursement amount.



   2.12 | _Acknowledgement._ 
---|--- 

The Parties acknowledge that Scotland may, within a reasonable time prior to
Closing, direct that all or certain of the Purchased Assets be transferred or
assigned, as the case may be, by the Vendors at Closing directly to one or
more existing or new direct or indirect subsidiaries of Commonwealth resident
in Canada for Canadian Tax purposes to the extent any such assignment or
transfer would not (a) result in any Vendor being obligated to obtain any
additional Consent or (b) otherwise adversely affect or delay the ability of
the Parties to consummate the Transactions, _provided_ that no such assignment
shall affect any employment obligation of Purchaser to those Non-Union
Employees who have accepted Purchasers or any of its Affiliates offer of
employment or affect the employment of any Union Employees by Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates as their successor employer in accordance with the terms of
all applicable Collective Agreements. Purchaser or one or more of its
Affiliates shall (a) recognize each applicable union as the sole and exclusive
bargaining agent of any Union Employees; (b) acknowledge that it is the
successor employer of those Union Employees for all purposes; and (c) agree
to consent to all necessary applications before any applicable labour
relations board regarding the transfer of any certificate of representation
with respect to those Union Employees.

 



\- 23 -  ---|--- 

At the Closing, Parent, the Vendors and Purchaser shall enter into (a) an
agreement substantially on the terms set out in Section A of the Disclosure
Letter (the "Transitional Services Agreement"), and (b) an agreement
substantially on the terms set out in Section B of the Disclosure Letter (the
"Trademark Agreement").



   2.14 | _Just 4 U._ 
---|--- 

Parent and Purchaser agree with respect to the use in Canada of the "Just 4
U" program (the "Just 4 U Program") as follows:



   (a) | Not later than 120 days following the Closing Date, Parent shall,
by written notice, offer to Scotland the exclusive right and license to use
and operate the Just 4 U Program in Canada (the "Program License"), which
notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the terms and conditions,
including fees and/or other payment amounts applicable to such license, in
each case as shall be determined by Parent (the "Just 4 U Offer"). Scotland
shall have the exclusive right of negotiation with Parent with respect to the
Just 4 U Offer for a period of 30 days following delivery thereof (the "Offer
Period"). Prior to the expiration of the Offer Period, Parent shall not,
directly or indirectly, negotiate with any Person not affiliated with Scotland
for the Program License. 
---|--- 
 



   (b) | If, during the Offer Period, Scotland shall have accepted the
Just 4 U Offer (or if Scotland and Parent shall have agreed to other mutually
acceptable terms and conditions), then Parent shall grant, and Scotland shall
accept, the Program License upon and subject to the fees, terms and conditions
contained in the Just 4 U Offer (or as otherwise mutually agreed) and Parent
and Scotland shall prepare and execute definitive license documentation
consistent therewith. 
---|--- 



   (c) | If, during the Offer Period, Scotland shall not have accepted the
Just 4 U Offer (or if Scotland and Parent shall not have agreed to other
mutually acceptable terms and conditions), Parent shall have no obligation to
grant the Program License to Scotland and Parent shall be entitled, following
the expiry of the Offer Period, to (i) grant one or more Program Licenses to
one more Persons not affiliated with Scotland on terms and conditions
(including fees) that, in the aggregate, are no less favourable to Parent than
those contained in the Just 4 U Offer, or (ii) make another offer to Scotland
in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.14. 
---|--- 



   2.15 | _Financial Statements._ 
---|---

balance sheet and the accompanying consolidated statements of operations,
statements of comprehensive income, statements of stockholders equity and
statements of cash flows for the fiscal year or fiscal period then ended, and
all notes in respect thereof, prepared in accordance with US GAAP (the
"Quarterly Financials"). Purchaser shall promptly reimburse the Vendors for
the reasonable costs and expenses related to preparation of the Quarterly
Financials following delivery of reasonable documentation by the Vendors to
Purchaser in respect thereof. 
---|---

   (n) | _Intellectual Property._ 
---|--- 



     | (i) | Attached as Section 3.1(n) of the Disclosure Letter is a
complete and accurate list of all registrations and applications for
registration for the Intellectual Property owned by the Vendors. The owned
Intellectual Property, together with any Intellectual Property licensed by any
of the Vendors and the Excluded IP, comprises all material intellectual
property necessary to properly conduct the Business. The Vendors are the
beneficial owners or licensees as of the Closing of the Intellectual Property,
free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens. Except in the case of
Intellectual Property of which it is a licensee and except in respect of off-
the-shelf commercially available software, none of the Vendors is a party to
or bound by any contract or other obligation whatsoever that materially limits
or impairs its ability to use, sell, transfer, assign or convey the
Intellectual Property (other than as listed in Section 3.1(n) of the
Disclosure Letter which provides particulars of all material limitations and
impairments). Any Intellectual Property which is not owned by the Vendors is
being used only with the consent of or license from the legal owner thereof,
and all such consents and licenses are, to the knowledge of the Vendors, in
full force and effect and are listed or described in Section 3.1(n) of the
Disclosure Letter; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) |

Subject to the receipt of all Consents, if Scotland or any of its Affiliates

neither the Transactions nor the operation of the Business by Scotland after
Closing will

\- 29 -  respect of Intellectual Property in any material respect or entitle the legal
owner of the Intellectual Property not owned by any of the Vendors to
terminate or modify any such contract or licenses in any material respect, or
otherwise materially adversely affect Scotlands rights under same. Other than
pursuant to a license disclosed in Section 3.1(n) of the Disclosure Letter,
no Person has been granted any interest in or right to use all or any material
portion of the Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of the Vendors, the
conduct of the Business does not infringe upon the intellectual property
rights of any other Person. No claim of any infringements or breach of any
intellectual property rights in Canada of any Person has been made or
threatened, in writing or otherwise, against any of the Vendors or Parent, nor
have any of the Vendors or Parent received, in the twelve (12) months
immediately prior to the Closing, any notice that its conduct of the Business,
including the use of the Intellectual Property, infringes upon or breaches any
intellectual property rights of any Person, and none of the Vendors or Parent
has any knowledge of any infringement or violation within the twelve (12)
months immediately prior to the Closing of any of the rights in the
Intellectual Property by any Person. None of the Vendors is aware of
any state of facts that casts doubt on the validity or enforceability of any
of the Intellectual Property which is material to the operation of the
Business. The Vendors have provided Scotland with a true and complete copy of
all Contracts that comprise or are related to the Intellectual Property,
other than those in respect of any "off the shelf", shrink-wrap software or
that are not material to the operation of the Business. Following the Closing,
none of the Vendors will retain or use the Intellectual Property other than
the Excluded IP or pursuant to new licenses obtained by the Vendors where such
retention or use would result in a violation of Section 6.16(a). The Vendors
own or hold current and valid licenses for all material software used in the
Business, including "off the shelf", shrink-wrap software; 
---|--- 



     | (iii) | The Vendors do not have in their possession copies of
source code for any computer programs forming part of the Intellectual
Property. The Intellectual Property consisting of software of which a Vendor
is the author does not contain or utilize any encryption, enciphering or other
similar technology other than as set forth in Section 3.1(n) of the Disclosure
Letter. To the Vendors knowledge, the Intellectual Property consisting of
computer programs does not contain any viruses, bugs, time locks, Trojan
horses, back doors or other means by which they may be disabled or remotely
accessed. All material computer programs included in the Intellectual
Property operate in all material respects substantially within their
specifications without substantial error or material defect; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | None of the representations or warranties contained in this
Section 3.1(n) shall apply to the Excluded IP and all references herein to
Intellectual Property in this Section 3.1(n) shall exclude the Excluded IP; 
---|---|--- 



   (o) | _Inventories_. The Inventory reflected in the Interim Balance
Sheet, taken as a whole, generally consists (i) with respect to Inventory held

to the amount of fees payable and certain other financial terms, pursuant to
which the Lender has committed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth therein, to lend the amounts set forth in the Financing Commitment
(the "Financing"). The Financing Commitment has not been amended or modified
prior to the date of this Agreement, and, as of the date hereof, the
commitments contained in the Financing Commitment have not been withdrawn,

together with the available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
of Purchaser, will be sufficient for Purchaser to pay all amounts due

any of their respective Affiliates is currently subject to any outstanding
material judgment, order or decree entered in any lawsuit or proceeding that
would materially impair or delay the consummation of Transactions.

and Commonwealth agrees and acknowledges as follows:

by, any representations, warranties, covenants, conditions, understandings

of doubt, each of Scotland and Commonwealth hereby acknowledges that none of
the Vendors or any of their respective shareholders, Affiliates or
representatives, has made or is making any representation or warranty with

or business plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or
business plans).

   (b) |

With respect to any review, evaluation or investigation to be conducted by or
on behalf of Scotland during the Interim Period regarding the environmental
status or condition of any Real Property or Leased Properties (including

presence) of any Hazardous Materials at such location), the Parties agree
further as follows: (i) Scotland shall be entitled to conduct, or have

the ordinary conduct of the Business and with ongoing consultation with the
Vendors, (A) customary Phase I environmental site assessments with respect to
such locations and (B) with the prior consent of the Vendors, Phase II
environmental site assessments, it being understood and agreed that the

best efforts to minimize the number of Phase II environmental site assessments
conducted (collectively, the " _Interim Period Environmental Review_ ");

approve (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) any scope or
statement of work in respect thereof prior to the commencement of such Phase I
or Phase II assessments; (ii) except as otherwise required by Law, under no
circumstances shall Scotland disclose, or permit to be disclosed, to Parent,
the Vendors or any of their Affiliates, employees, agents, counsel,
accountants, consultants or other representatives the results or findings

requested by Parent, in which case Scotland shall provide Parent with a copy
of any such requested reports, assessments or other materials containing the
results or findings of such Interim

to such individual as a result of the Interim Period Environmental Report,

limitation of any indemnity under Section 6.4(a), Scotland shall further
indemnify and save the Vendor Indemnified Persons harmless of and from any
damages suffered by, imposed upon or asserted against any of the Vendor
Indemnified Persons as a result of, in respect of, or arising out of, under

acknowledgement and agreement to representatives of the Union Employees as may
be reasonably requested by Vendors to effect the orderly transfer

supplement or other modification to or waiver of any provision of the
Financing Commitment that amends, supplements or otherwise modifies the
conditions precedent to the Financing Commitment), or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | issue or sell, or agree to issue or sell, any equity, debt
or other securities or issue or incur any additional indebtedness or undertake

in each case, if such amendment, replacement, supplement or other
modification of, or waiver of any provision, or issuance or sale of, or
agreement to issue or sell, any equity, debt or other securities, issuance or
incurrence of additional indebtedness, or other transaction or action would
reasonably be expected to, directly or indirectly, (A) reduce the aggregate
amount of the Financing Commitment, in whole or in part (except as provided in
Section 6.15(c)), or (B) impose new or additional conditions precedent or
otherwise amend or expand any conditions precedent to the receipt of the

the other parties to the Financing Commitment or to consummate the
Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as
provided in Section 6.15(c), Purchaser shall not, directly or indirectly,
permit the Lender to reduce the commitment of the Lender under the Financing

   10.2 | _Scotland Indemnification in Favour of the Vendors._ 
---|--- 

From and after the Closing, subject to this Article X, Scotland and
Commonwealth, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and save the Vendors,
Parent, their respective Affiliates, shareholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the "Vendor Indemnified
Persons") harmless of and from any Damages suffered by, imposed upon or
asserted against any of the Vendor Indemnified Persons as a result of,
in respect of, or arising out of, under or pursuant to:



   (a) | any failure of Scotland or Commonwealth to perform or fulfill any
covenant of Scotland or Commonwealth under this Agreement, including the
indemnification covenants in Sections 2.8, 2.9, 6.4, 6.11, 6.13, 6.15, 11.4,
11.5 and 11.6; 
---|--- 



   (b) | any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty given
by Scotland or Commonwealth contained in this Agreement; and 
---|--- 
 



   (c) | the Assumed Liabilities. 
---|--- 



   10.3 | _Additional Tax Indemnity._ 
---|--- 



   (a) | Notwithstanding any of the representations and warranties of
Parent and the Vendors, Scotland and Commonwealth shall jointly and severally
indemnify and save Parent US Group harmless of and from any Excess Foreign
Tax Credit. 
---|--- 



   (b) | The indemnity under Section 10.3(a) shall be computed in
accordance with the following assumptions: 
---|--- 
 



     | (i) | Any capital losses incurred during Parents Sale Year and
available to Parent in computing its "limitation" under US Tax Code Section
904(a) shall be the lesser of (a) the capital losses actually reflected on
Parents US federal income Tax Return for Parents Sale Year ("Parents US
Sale Year Return"); and (b) one billion two hundred and fifty million US
dollars (US$1,250,000,000); 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | With respect to the Sale Year, Parent US Group would not
have been subject to the tax described in Section 55 of the US Tax Code had
(a) the Sale Transactions never been consummated; and (b) the loss described
in 10.3(b)(i) never been reported on Parents US Sale Year Return; 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 65 -  on Parents US Sale Year Return had (a) the Sale Transactions never been
consummated; and (b) the loss described in 10.3(b)(i) never been reported on
such Tax Return; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | The procedure described in paragraph (ii) of the definition
of "Distribution of Net Asset Amount" is consummated as described therein;  
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | The Treaty Assumptions are true; 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | The amount of US FTC carryovers (as determined by US Tax
Code Section 904(c)) available to Parent in computing its US federal income
Tax liability for Parents Sale Year does not exceed thirty-seven million US
dollars (US$37,000,000) (or such amount as reflects the amount of any
subsequent adjustments by the relevant Tax Authorities or the amount shown on
any amended Tax return that takes into account such adjustments); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (vii) | The remaining Excluded Assets (after repayment of
remaining Excluded Liabilities), if any, are distributed by London to US
Holdco in the Sale Year, but excluding for this purpose items 2, 3 and 4 in
Section 2.2(j) of the Disclosure Letter. 
---|---|--- 

The parties acknowledge that as of the date hereof, the Foreign Source
Deductions are estimated to be approximately five hundred million US dollars
(US$500,000,000) plus any costs or expenses related to the Sale Transactions;
_provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of computing any Excess Foreign
Tax Credit, the actual amount of Foreign Source Deductions reflected on
Parents US Sale Year Return (or such amount as reflects the amount of any
subsequent adjustments by the relevant Tax Authorities) shall govern.



   (c) | If after a Tax Indemnity Event Parent determines that an Excess
Foreign Tax Credit has arisen in respect of the Tax Indemnity Event, Parent
shall promptly deliver written notice of a claim (a "Tax Notice") in respect
thereof to Scotland. The Tax Notice shall provide sufficient detail to enable
Scotland to reasonably determine the amount of the Excess Foreign Tax Credit,
and, if applicable, shall have attached thereto a copy of any notice of
assessment or similar document issued by a relevant Tax Authority which
relates to such claim. Within ten (10) Business Days following delivery of
such Tax Notice, Scotland shall remit the full amount of the Excess Foreign
Tax Credit (without withholding or deduction on account of any Taxes) to
Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds, denominated in USD. If
Parent determines that any payment in respect of the Excess Foreign Tax
Credit is subject to any additional Tax or withholding or deduction for or on
account of Taxes, then the amount otherwise payable under Section 10.3(a)
shall be increased by such additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") as will
result in Parent receiving an amount net of such additional Tax or withholding
or deduction that is equal to the amount Parent would have received had there
been no such additional Tax or withholding or deduction, and in the case of
withholding or deduction by Scotland, any amount so withheld or deducted shall
be promptly remitted by Scotland to the relevant Tax Authority in accordance
with applicable Law. Thereafter, Parent may from time to time notify Scotland
in writing of any legal or other professional fees or disbursements payable
by any member of the Parent Group in connection with the Excess Foreign Tax
Credit, and Scotland shall reimburse Parent for such amounts forthwith upon
delivery of each such written notice, and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days following such delivery. 
---|--- 
 



\- 66 -  believes would cause an Excess Foreign Tax Credit, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to give Scotland reasonable advance notice
of, and to consult with Scotland regarding, any such Tax Return. Parent agrees
to file Parents US Sale Year Return in good faith and in a manner that (i) is
in conformity with applicable Law, (ii) does not have as its principal
purpose the creation or increase of any amount payable by Scotland under
Section 10.3(a) and (iii) is not inconsistent with such filings in prior
years; _provided_ , _however_ , that items relating to the matters listed on
Section 10.3(d) of the Disclosure Letter may be included in Parents US Sale
Year Return. 
---|--- 



   (e) | Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i)
if the cumulative amount of benefit London receives from the utilization of US
FTC carryovers generated in the Sale Year during the applicable carry-forward
period (as determined by US Tax Code Section 904(c)) exceeds an aggregate of
fifteen million US dollars (US$15,000,000), Parent shall pay to Scotland an
amount equal to the lesser of (A) the excess of the cumulative amount of
benefit London receives from the utilization of US FTC carryovers generated in
the Sale Year during the applicable carry-forward period over fifteen million
US dollars (US$15,000,000) and (B) the excess of any payment made by Scotland
pursuant to Section 10.3(a) over fifteen million US dollars (US$15,000,000),
and (ii) if the cumulative amount of additional limitation on US FTCs incurred
by London during the applicable carry-forward period (as determined by US Tax
Code Section 904(c)) exceeds an aggregate of fifteen million US dollars
(US$15,000,000), Scotland shall make additional payments to Parent in an
amount equal to the excess of the cumulative amount of additional limitation
on US FTCs incurred by London over fifteen million US dollars (US$15,000,000). 
---|--- 



   (f) | Parent shall have sole control of the conduct of all Tax Matters,
including any settlement or compromise thereof. Prior to the conduct of any
Tax Matter that Parent reasonably believes would cause an Excess Foreign Tax
Credit, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give Scotland
reasonable advance notice of, and to consult with Scotland regarding, any such
Tax Matter. If as a result of the Final Resolution of any Tax Matter, the
amount of any Excess Foreign Tax Credit previously paid by Scotland to Parent
exceeds the amount such Excess Foreign Tax Credit would have been had such
Final Resolution been incorporated therein, Parent shall promptly pay to
Scotland the amount of such excess plus any interest received by Parent in
relation to an Excess Foreign Tax Credit previously paid by Scotland (net of
any Taxes payable as a result of the receipt of such refund). If
Scotland determines that any payment made by Parent under this Section
10.3(f) is subject to any additional Tax or withholding or deduction for or on
account of Taxes, then the amount otherwise payable under this Section 10.3(f)
shall be increased by such additional amounts as will result in Scotland
receiving an amount net of such additional Tax or withholding or deduction
that is equal to the amount Scotland would have received had there been no
such additional Tax or withholding or deduction. 
---|--- 



   (g) | Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent shall not be entitled to recover any Excess Foreign Tax Credit if
Parent delivers any Tax Notice to Scotland in respect of such Excess Foreign
Tax Credit more than thirty (30) days after the expiration of the applicable
statutes of limitations (including any applicable extensions) with respect to
any Tax relating to or arising from the Sale Transactions or the distribution
of the Excluded Assets. Parent agrees to notify Scotland of any waiver or
extension of such statutes of limitations within thirty (30) Business Days of
such waiver or extension. 
---|--- 
 



\- 67 -  to the other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance relating to Taxes, including access to Tax personnel, Books and
Records and Tax Records, as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax
Returns by Scotland or the Parent Group, the making of any election relating
to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Tax Authority and the
prosecution or defense of any Tax Matter. 
---|--- 



   (i) | The procedures for indemnification under this Section 10.3 shall
be governed by this Section 10.3 and not by Section 10.5. 
---|--- 
 



   10.4 | _Survival and Time Limitations._ 
---|--- 



   (a) | The representations and warranties of the Vendors and Parent
contained in this Agreement and in any Ancillary Agreement shall survive the
Closing and, notwithstanding the Closing or any investigation made by or on
behalf of Scotland, shall continue for a period of eighteen (18) months after
the Closing Date and any claim in respect thereof shall be made in writing
during such time period, except that:  
---|--- 



     | (i) | The representations and warranties set out in Sections
3.1(a)(i), 3.1(b)(i), 3.1(c), 3.1(d), 4.1(a), 4.1(b)(i), 4.1(c) and 4.1(d)
(and the corresponding representations and warranties set out in the
certificate to be delivered pursuant to Section 7.1(a)) shall survive and
continue in full force and effect forever; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | The representations and warranties relating to Taxes set
out in Section 3.1(w) shall survive and continue in full force and effect
until, but not beyond, the expiration of the period, if any, during which an
assessment, reassessment or other similar form of recognized document
assessing liability for such Taxes may be made against the Vendors.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no claim in respect of
Taxes may be made by any Scotland Indemnified Person in respect of any
representations, warranties or covenants other than those specified in Section
3.1(w); and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | A claim for any breach by the Vendors or Parent of any of
their representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
Ancillary Agreement involving fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation may be
made at any time subject to applicable limitation periods imposed by Law. 
---|---|--- 



   (b) | The representations and warranties of Scotland contained in this
Agreement and in any Ancillary Agreement shall survive the Closing and,
notwithstanding the Closing or any investigation made by or on behalf of the
Vendors and Parent shall continue for a period of eighteen (18) months after
the Closing Date and any claim in respect thereof shall be made in writing
during such time period, except that:  
---|--- 



     | (i) | The representations and warranties set out in Sections
5.1(a), 5.1(b)(i), 5.1(c) and 5.1(d) (and the corresponding representations
and warranties set out in the certificates to be delivered pursuant to
Section 7.2(a)) shall survive and continue in full force and effect forever;
and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | A claim for any breach by Scotland of any of its
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any Ancillary
Agreement involving fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation may be made at any
time subject only to applicable periods imposed by Law. 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 68 -  or in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto or in
connection herewith that by its terms contemplates performance prior to the
Effective Time shall continue for a period of eighteen (18) months after the
Closing Date and any claim in respect thereof shall be made in writing during
such time period. Each other covenant or agreement of the Parties contained
in this Agreement or in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant
hereto or in connection herewith that contemplates performance after the
Closing shall survive for the time period contemplated for performance.  
---|---|--- 



   10.5 | _Procedure for Indemnification._ 
---|--- 



   (a) | _Notice of Claims_. 
---|--- 



     | (i) | If an Indemnified Person becomes aware of any act, omission
or state of facts that may give rise to Damages in respect of which a right of
indemnification is provided for under this Article X, the Indemnified Person
must notify the Indemnifying Person, which notice shall specify whether the
potential Damages arise as a result of: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (A) | a claim directly by the Indemnified Person against the
Indemnifying Person (a "Direct Claim"); or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (B) | a claim made by a Person against the Indemnified Person (a
"Third Party Claim"); 
---|---|--- 
 

as soon as reasonably practicable, _provided_ that the failure to provide such
notice as soon as reasonably practicable, to the Indemnifying Person shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Person of liability except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Person is actually prejudiced by such failure or delay.

 



     | (ii) | The Indemnified Person must include in a notice given under
clause (i) relevant details then known to the Indemnified Person of the Direct
Claim or Third Party Claim, and the events, matters or circumstances giving
rise to the Direct Claim or Third Party Claim and an extract of any document
that identifies the liability or amount to which the Direct Claim or Third
Party Claim relates or other evidence of the amount of the Direct Claim or
Third Party Claim, and must after giving such notice keep the Indemnifying
Person reasonably informed of all developments in relation to the Direct Claim
or Third Party Claim. 
---|---|--- 
 



   (b) | _Third Party Claims._ 
---|--- 



     | (i) | In the case of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person
shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defence of such
Third Party Claim and to accept, compromise or pay, agree to arbitrate,
compromise or settle or make any admission or take any action in relation to,
such Third Party Claim, _provided_ that the Indemnifying Person shall
reimburse the Indemnified Person for the reasonable costs of the Indemnified
Person relating to such Third Party Claim and the conduct of any defence of
such Third Party Claim. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | If requested by the Indemnified Person, the Indemnifying
Person will provide to the Indemnified Person copies of all pleadings,
notices, communications, documentary or other evidence with respect to such
Third Party Claim, except where receipt of such documents would waive any
claim of privilege by the Indemnifying Person or its legal representative. 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 69 -  and expense, liaise with the Indemnifying Person in relation to the defence of
such Third Party Claim, and participate in, but not to determine or conduct,
any defence of a Third Party Claim or settlement negotiations with respect to
a Third Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Person has in its sole discretion
determined to permit the Indemnified Person to defend such Third Party Claim,
in which event the Indemnifying Person shall have the right to participate in,
but not to determine or conduct, any defence of a Third Party Claim or
settlement negotiations with respect to such Third Party Claim.  
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | No settlement, resolution or compromise of such Third Party
Claim by the Indemnified Person is determinative of the existence or amount of
any Damages in respect of such Third Party Claim, unless the Indemnifying
Person consents in writing to such settlement, resolution or compromise, which
consent must not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, and shall
be deemed to have been given by the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified
Person unless the Indemnifying Person notifies the Indemnified Person in
writing within ten (10) Business Days of a request by the Indemnified Person
that it does not give its consent.  
---|---|--- 



   10.6 | _Indemnification Principles and Limitations._ 
---|--- 



   (a) | Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | In no event shall the aggregate obligation of (A) the
Vendors and Parent to indemnify Scotland Indemnified Persons under Section
10.1(b), or (B) the aggregate obligation of Purchaser and Commonwealth to
indemnify Vendor Indemnified Persons under Section 10.2(b), respectively,
exceed $600,000,000. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | No claims for indemnification pursuant to Sections 10.1(b)
or 10.2(b) hereof may be made by any Scotland Indemnified Person or any Vendor
Indemnified Person, respectively, until the aggregate amount of all Damages
for which claims may be made thereunder exceeds $50,000,000, and once such
threshold amount has been reached, indemnification shall be made from dollar
one. 
---|---|--- 
 



   (b) | In computing any amount payable to a Scotland Indemnified Person
or a Vendor Indemnified Person pursuant to the provisions hereunder as a
result of, or in connection with, a Damage, the amount payable shall be
computed taking into account Tax relief available to such Person in relation
to such Damage and any Taxes payable by the such Person as a result of being
so indemnified. If any payment made by a Party pursuant to this Agreement is
deemed by the Excise Tax Act (Canada) to include GST, or is deemed by any
applicable provincial or territorial legislation to include a similar value
added or multi-staged tax, the amount of such payment shall be increased
accordingly. 
---|--- 



   (c) |

Indemnities under this Article X shall be net of actual recoveries from
insurance policies or other third parties. In the event any amounts
recovered under insurance policies or other third parties are not received
before any claim for indemnification is paid pursuant to this Article X, and
thereafter if the Indemnified Person receives any recovery, then the amount of
such recovery shall be used to refund any payments made by the Indemnifying
Person which would not have been so paid had such recovery been 

---|--- 
 



\- 70 -  to pursue recoveries under any "incurrence" based insurance policies or other
third parties, then the Indemnifying Person shall have the right of
subrogation to pursue such insurance policies or third parties and may take
any reasonable actions necessary to pursue such rights of subrogation in its
name or the name of the party from whom subrogation is obtained.
The Indemnified Person shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Person to pursue
any such subrogation claim. 
---|--- 



   (d) | Each Scotland Indemnified Person or Vendor Indemnified Person, as
applicable, will take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate all
Damages indemnifiable under this Article X, which steps shall include
availing itself of any defenses, limitations, rights of contribution, claims
against third Persons and other rights at law or equity and the reasonable
costs associated with such steps shall be included in the calculation of
Damages in respect of the relevant claim. 
---|--- 



   (e) | Solely for the purposes of calculating the amount of Damages or
other amounts due as a result of any indemnity claim under this Article X
based on a breach of a representation or warranty (and not for the purposes
of determining a breach thereof), each of the representations and warranties
made herein shall be deemed to have been made without the inclusion of
limitations or qualifications as to materiality, such as the words
"material", "immaterial" and "in all material respects" or words of similar
import (except where any such provision requires disclosure of lists of items
of a material nature or above a specified threshold). 
---|--- 



   (f) | No Party will be liable to any other Party in connection with
this Agreement for any consequential, punitive, special, incidental or
indirect Damages, including lost profits or multiple-based Damages, other
than (x) any such Damages that are awarded to a non-Affiliate third party in
connection with a Third Party Claim, (y) lost profits that constitute direct
damages, or (z) in connection with any claim of actual fraud. Subject to the
foregoing limitation, each Party hereby expressly releases the other Parties,
their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives from any such liability.  
---|--- 



   (g) | Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, any amounts
payable pursuant to the indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall
be paid without duplication, and in no event shall any Party be indemnified
under different provisions of this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, Section 2.7(d) hereof) for the same amounts. 
---|--- 
 



   (h) | Any payment made by any Party pursuant to Section 2.7, 10.1 or
10.2 shall be treated as an adjustment in the equivalent amount to the
Purchase Price.  
---|--- 



   10.7 | _Exclusivity of Indemnification._ 
---|--- 
 

From and after the Closing, the provisions of this Article X are intended to
provide the exclusive remedy as to all Damages that any Party hereunder
may incur arising from or relating to this Agreement, and subject to and
without waiving or limiting the other provisions of this Article X, each Party
hereby waives on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, to the fullest extent
permitted under Applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims and causes
of action it or any of their respective Affiliates may have against any other
Party or its Affiliates with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement,
whether arising under or based upon any applicable Law (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any claim to rescind this Agreement or any of the
Transactions); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not be
interpreted to limit the availability of equitable 

 



\- 71 -   remedies, including specific performance, which may be sought by an
indemnitee in connection with a breach of any covenant or agreement contained
herein and shall not limit any available remedy for actual fraud.

ARTICLE 11

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS



   11.1 | _Access to Books and Records._ 
---|--- 

For a period of ten (10) years from the Closing Date or for such longer
period as may be required by applicable Law, Scotland shall retain all
original accounting Books and Records relating to the Vendors or their
Affiliates in respect of the Business for the period prior to the Closing
Date, but Scotland shall not be responsible or liable to the Vendors for or as
a result of any accidental loss or destruction of or damage to any such Books
and Records. If Scotland desires to dispose of any Books and Records before
the expiration of such ten year period, it shall be permitted to do so
provided that it first offers to provide the Books and Records to the Vendors
(or any of them) and such offer has not been accepted. So long as any such
Books and Records are retained by Scotland pursuant to this Agreement, the
Vendors shall have the reasonable right to inspect and to make copies (at
their own expense) of them at any time upon reasonable request during normal
business hours and upon reasonable notice for any proper purpose and without
undue interference to the business operations of Scotland. Scotland shall have
the right to have its representatives present during any such inspection and,
if requested by the Vendors, Scotland shall provide access to such employees
of Scotland with knowledge of the Books and Records to assist in such
investigations.



   11.2 | _Confidentiality._ 
---|--- 

After the Closing, the Vendors and Parent will and the Vendors shall cause
their Subsidiaries to keep confidential and not use for competitive purposes
all information in its possession or under its control relating to the
Business, unless (a) such information is or becomes generally available to
the public (other than as a result of a disclosure by the Vendors or their
Affiliates in violation of this Agreement), (b) the disclosure of such
information is required by Law, or (c) for the purpose of carrying on
business in Canada to the extent that the information relates to business that
is not part of the Restricted Business.



   11.3 | _Further Assurances._ 
---|--- 

From time to time after the Closing Date, each Party shall, at the request of
any other Party, execute and deliver such additional conveyances, transfers
and other assurances as may be reasonably required to effectively transfer the
Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities to Scotland or its designated
Affiliates and to carry out the intent of this Agreement and any Ancillary
Agreement. If any Excluded Entity owns an asset that, if owned by any Vendor,
would be a Purchased Asset, the Vendors shall cause such Excluded Entity to
execute and deliver such additional conveyances, transfers and other
assurances as may be reasonably required to effectively transfer such asset to
Scotland or its designated Affiliate. For the avoidance of doubt, none of
the Vendors shall be required to transfer any of the assets described in
Section 1.1(a) of the Disclosure Letter. Following the Closing, Scotland will
reasonably cooperate in returning to the Vendors all documents and property in
Scotlands possession not comprising any of the Purchased Assets or relating
to any Assumed Liability.

 



\- 72 -  ---|--- 



   (a) | From and after the Closing, with respect to any Assigned
Contract, Lease or Authorization for which a Consent has not been obtained
prior to Closing, in order that Scotland may realize the full benefit
thereof, the Vendors shall, at the expense of Scotland, in the name of the
Vendors, unless Scotland otherwise requests or directs, as the case may be, or
otherwise as Scotland shall specify:  
---|--- 



     | (i) | hold such Assigned Contracts, Leases, Authorizations and
Contractual Rights thereunder in trust for the benefit of Scotland; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | use commercially reasonable efforts to take all such
actions as shall, in the reasonable opinion of Scotland, be necessary or
proper in order that the value of such Assigned Contracts, Leases,
Authorizations and Contractual Rights thereunder be preserved and enure to the
benefit of Scotland, and that the collection of moneys due and payable to
Scotland in and under such Assigned Contracts, Leases and Contractual Rights
thereunder be received by Scotland; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | promptly pay over to Scotland all moneys collected by or
paid to the Vendors in respect of Accounts Receivable and every such Assigned
Contract, Lease and Contractual Rights thereunder; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
such Consents; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (v) | transfer to Purchaser or its designee such Assigned
Contracts, Leases and Authorizations for which Consents are obtained promptly
following the obtaining of such Consents. 
---|---|--- 



   (b) | In addition to the foregoing, at the request of Scotland and at
Scotlands expense, if a Consent has not been obtained prior to the Closing
for the assignment of a Lease, London shall: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | to the extent such transfer is possible without a Consent,
assign or otherwise transfer such Lease to a newly formed subsidiary of London
in respect of which London will cause the nominees of Scotland to be
appointed as officers (and Parent shall cause such newly formed subsidiary to
act in accordance with, and not in contravention of, the provisions of this
Section 11.4); and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | to the extent such agreement is possible without Consent,
enter into an agreement providing that Scotland will manage the business
carried on from any such leased premises fully to its account and to the
complete exoneration of the Vendor Indemnified Persons. 
---|---|--- 



   (c) | Scotland shall indemnify and save the Vendor Indemnified Persons
harmless of and from any damages suffered by, imposed upon or asserted against
any of the Vendor Indemnified Persons as a result of, in respect of, or
arising out of, under or pursuant to the arrangements contemplated under this
Section 11.4. 
---|--- 



   11.5 | _Conduct of the Business Post-Closing._ 
---|--- 

From and after the Closing, Scotland and Commonwealth shall indemnify and save
the Vendor Indemnified Persons harmless of and from any Damages suffered by,
imposed upon or asserted against any Vendor Indemnified Person as a result
of, in respect of, connected with, or

 



\- 73 -   arising out of, under, or pursuant to the ownership, use of operation of the
Business following the Closing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in
connection with any arrangements pursuant to Section 11.4), except to the
extent such Damages are the subject of Section 10.1.



   11.6 | _Management of Assumed Litigation._ 
---|--- 
 

Promptly following the Effective Time, Scotland shall assume at its sole cost
and expense, and with the counsel of its choice, the prosecution or
defence, as applicable, of all grievances, actions, suits or proceedings, at
law or in equity, and all arbitrations, administrative or other proceedings by
or before any Governmental Entity by, against or affecting any of the Vendors
in respect of the Business or any of the Purchased Assets or Assumed
Liabilities, other than those related to Taxes that are Excluded Assets or
Excluded Liabilities or any proceedings against the Vendors or any of their
Affiliates in respect of the Transaction or the obligations of the Vendors
and their Affiliates under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement
(collectively, the "Assumed Litigation"). Scotland is entitled to take all
steps necessary to reflect the transfer or transmission of interest in the
Assumed Litigation from the applicable Vendor to Scotland, including by
notification of the other parties and judicial authorities in each proceeding
in accordance with applicable Law. Scotland will not consent to the entry of
any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to the
Assumed Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent unless such
judgment, compromise or settlement (i) provides for the payment by Scotland of
money as sole relief for the claimant (to the extent that any payment is
required), and (ii) involves no finding or admission of any violation of Law
or the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made
against the Vendors or Parent. Scotland shall keep Parent reasonably informed
regarding the status of the Assumed Litigation. To the extent that any Assumed

knowledgeable officer(s) of the Vendors executing and delivering an officers
certificate (the form and substance of which shall be subject to the approval
of the Vendors, acting reasonably) whereby said officer confirms (without
personal liability) to the title insurer those aspects of the Vendors
ownership of the relevant Real Property deemed necessary by the title insurer
and to which the Vendors have no

 



\- 74 -   reasonable objection. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this Section 11.7 shall in any manner (x) increase
or decrease the scope or any other aspect of any of the Vendors
representations or warranties and/or other obligations contained in this
Agreement, (y) result in any Vendor incurring any additional costs (other than
the Vendors own legal fees and photocopying costs), or (z) constitute a
condition to the Closing.
