owned subsidiaries) and other than the Dissenting Shares, will be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, all as more fully provided
in this Agreement. 



D. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, as a condition and
inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, Parent and
certain shareholders of the Company (the " _Principal Shareholders_ ") are

2 AGREEMENT

 



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and the representations,
warranties and covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as
follows:



ARTICLE I



THE OFFER



1.1. _The Offer_.

 



(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Article VIII and none of the events or conditions set forth in Annex A
shall have occurred and be existing, Parent shall cause Subcorp to commence,
and Subcorp shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")), as promptly as reasonably
practicable, but in no event later than five business days, after the date of
this Agreement, the Offer. Parent shall cause Subcorp to accept for payment,
and Subcorp shall accept for payment, all shares of Company Common Stock that
have been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer at the
earliest time following the initial Expiration Date at which time all
conditions of the Offer shall have been satisfied or waived by Subcorp, and,
thereafter, Subcorp shall accept for payment all additional shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered during any subsequent offering period as
provided in Section 1.1(c). Subcorp shall not accept for payment any shares of
Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer unless there shall have
been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date such
number of shares of Company Common Stock that satisfy the Minimum Condition.
Subcorp expressly reserves the right to increase the Per Share Amount and to
waive any condition of the Offer, except the Minimum Condition. Without the
prior written consent of the Company, Subcorp shall not decrease the Per
Share Amount or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer,
decrease the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought to be purchased
in the Offer, impose conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth
in Annex A, change or waive the Minimum Condition or, except as provided in
Section 1.1(c) or (d), extend the expiration of the Offer beyond the initial
Expiration Date, or amend any other term of the Offer in a manner materially
adverse to the Company Shareholders. The Per Share Amount shall be paid less
any required withholding of Taxes, upon the terms and subject to satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions of the Offer set forth in Annex A. The Company
agrees that no shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of
its subsidiaries will be tendered in the Offer.



(b) Subcorp shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_Commission_ ") a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer on the date the Offer is commenced, which shall include an offer to
purchase, form of transmittal letter and form of notice of guaranteed delivery
(together with any supplements or amendments thereto, collectively, the "
_Offer Documents_ ") and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to the Company Shareholders in accordance in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the United
States federal securities laws. Parent and Subcorp will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer Documents to comply in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the United States federal
securities  



 

3  laws. The information provided and to be provided by the Company, Parent and
Subcorp for use in the Offer Documents shall not, on the date filed with
the Commission and on the date first published or sent or given to holders of
shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Shareholders_ "), as the case
may be, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, except that no representation is made by Parent or
Subcorp with respect to the information supplied by the Company for inclusion
in the Offer Documents. The Company, Parent and Subcorp each agree promptly to
correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and
to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and Parent further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the
Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the Commission and
disseminated to the Company Shareholders to the extent required by applicable
United States federal securities laws. The Company shall promptly furnish to
Parent or Subcorp all information concerning the Company that is required or
reasonably requested by Parent or Subcorp in connection with the
obligations relating to the Offer Documents contained in this Section 1.1(b).
The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the
Commission or dissemination to the Company Shareholders. In addition, Parent
and Subcorp shall provide the Company and its counsel any comments, whether
written or oral, that Parent or Subcorp or their counsel may receive from time
to time from the Commission or the staff of the Commission (the " _SEC Staff_
") with respect to the Offer Documents within a reasonable time after receipt
of such comments, consult with the Company and its counsel prior to responding
to such comments and provide the Company with copies of all written responses
and advise the Company as to the substance of all oral responses.



(c) Subject to the provisions of Article VIII and the terms and conditions
thereof, the Offer shall remain open until midnight, New York City time, on
the date that is 20 business days after the date the Offer is commenced (the
initial " _Expiration Date_ ," and any expiration time and date established
pursuant to an authorized extension of the Offer as so extended, also an "
_Expiration Date_ "). Subcorp may, without the consent of the Company, (A) if
at the time of the then scheduled Expiration Date any of the conditions of the
Offer are not satisfied or waived, extend the Offer for such period
as Subcorp determines; provided that such extension shall be in increments of
not more than five business days if all of the conditions set forth on Annex A
other than the Minimum Condition have been satisfied or waived at such
Expiration Date, (B) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the Commission or the SEC Staff
applicable to the Offer and (C) if at the then scheduled Expiration Date all
of the conditions set forth on Annex A have been satisfied or waived, extend
the Offer for one subsequent offering period (as provided in Rule 14d-11 under
the Exchange Act) for three to 20 business days after Subcorps acceptance for
payment of the Company Common Stock then tendered and not withdrawn pursuant
to the Offer in order to acquire at least 90% of the outstanding Company
Common Stock.



(d) The Company may cause the extension of the Expiration Date in accordance
with, and subject to the terms of, this Section 1.1(d).



(i) In the event that the Minimum Condition has not been satisfied or waived
at the then scheduled Expiration Date, at the written request of the Company,
Subcorp  



 

4  shall, and Parent shall cause Subcorp to, extend the Expiration Date in such
increments as Subcorp may reasonably determine until the earliest to occur
of (A) the satisfaction or waiver of such condition, (B) Parents reasonable
determination, after May 1, 2005, that such condition to the Offer is not
capable of being satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date, (C) the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or (D) the Outside
Date; provided that the Company shall not be entitled to any extension of the
Expiration Date contemplated by this Section 1.1(d)(i) if (x) any of the
obligations of the Principal Shareholders under the Support Agreement have
been breached by one or more of the Principal Shareholders beneficially
owning, individually or in the aggregate, more than 3% of the Fully Diluted
Shares or (y) York has breached any of his obligations under the York Support
Agreement or Miller has breached any of his obligations under the Miller
Support Agreement. 

---|--- 



(ii) In the event that any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall
not have expired or been terminated at the then scheduled Expiration Date, at
the written request of the Company, Subcorp shall, and Parent shall cause
Subcorp to, extend the Expiration Date in such increments as Subcorp may
reasonably determine until the earliest to occur of (A) the expiration
or termination of such waiting period, (B) the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms or (C) the Outside Date.



(iii) In the event that a failure to satisfy the condition in paragraph (d) of
Annex A shall exist and the cure period described therein shall not have
expired at the then scheduled Expiration Date, at the written request of the
Company, Subcorp shall, and Parent shall cause Subcorp to, extend the
Expiration Date in such increments as Subcorp may reasonably determine until
the earliest to occur of (A) the cure of such failure, (B) the expiration of
such cure period, (C) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms or (D) the Outside Date.



(iv) In the event that a notice contemplated by Section 6.3(c) is delivered to
Parent within three business days of the initial Expiration Date, then
Subcorp shall extend the Offer for a period of no less than three business
days.



(e) Subject to the prior satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the
Offer, Subcorp shall, and Parent shall cause Subcorp to, accept for payment,
and pay for, all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly, but in no event more than three
business days, following the Expiration Date.



1.2. _Company Action_.



(a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, and
represents and warrants that the Company Board, at a meeting duly called and
held at which all directors of the Company were present, has duly and
unanimously (i) approved this Agreement, and deemed this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement advisable,
fair to and in the best interests of the Company and the Company Shareholders;
(ii) approved this Agreement, the Support Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Support Agreement, including the Offer
and the Merger, in all respects, and such approval constitutes approval of the
Offer (and the acquisition of shares of Company  



 

5  Common Stock pursuant thereto), the Merger, this Agreement and the Support
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by such agreements for purposes
of Article 5.03 and Article 13.03 of the Texas Business Corporation Act (the
" _TBCA_ "); and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Company Shareholders
accept the Offer, that the Company Shareholders tender their shares of
Company Common Stock under the Offer to Subcorp, and that the Company
Shareholders approve this Agreement to the extent required by Applicable Laws.
The Company consents to the inclusion of such approval and recommendation in
the Offer Documents. 



(b) The Company hereby agrees to file with the Commission, as soon as
reasonably practicable on the day the Offer is commenced, a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 pertaining to the
Offer (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule

reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the
Company Shareholders in accordance in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the United States federal securities laws. The
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to
comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
United States federal securities laws. The information provided and to be
provided by the Company, Parent and Subcorp for use in the Schedule 14D-9
shall not, on the date filed with the Commission and on the date first
published or sent or given to the Company Shareholders, as the case may be,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except that no representation is made by the Company with
respect to the information supplied by Parent or Subcorp for inclusion in the
Schedule 14D-9. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to comply in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the United States
federal securities laws. The Company, Parent and Subcorp each agree promptly
to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if
and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary
to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the Commission

applicable requirements of the United States federal securities laws. Parent
and Subcorp shall promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning
Parent and Subcorp that is required or reasonably requested by the Company in
connection with the obligations relating to the Schedule 14D-9 contained in
this Section 1.2(b). Parent, Subcorp, and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to
the filing thereof with the Commission. In addition, the Company shall provide
Parent and its counsel any comments, whether written or oral, that the Company

Staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 within a reasonable time after
receipt of such comments, consult with Parent and its counsel prior to
responding to such comments and provide Parent with copies of all written

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company promptly will furnish (or cause
its transfer agent to furnish) Parent and Subcorp with mailing labels,
security position listings and any available listing or computer files
containing the names and addresses of the Company Shareholders as of a recent
date, and shall furnish Subcorp with such additional information and  



 

6  assistance (including updated lists of the Company Shareholders, mailing
labels and lists of securities positions) as Subcorp or its agents may
reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial
holders of shares of Company Common Stock. Except as required by Applicable
Laws, and except as necessary to communicate the Offer, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the Company Shareholders,
Parent and Subcorp (and their respective representatives) shall hold in
confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files to
the extent required by the confidentiality agreement between Parent and the
Company, dated November 23, 2004 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").
Subcorp hereby agrees to be bound, _mutatis mutandis_ , by the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement as if Subcorp were an original

1.3. _Board of Directors_.



(a) Promptly upon the acceptance of, and payment for, any shares of Company
Common Stock by Parent or Subcorp pursuant to and in accordance with the terms
of the Offer and this Agreement (the " _Appointment Time_ ") and for so long
thereafter as Parent and/or Subcorp own in aggregate more than 50% of the
outstanding Company Common Stock, and subject to Section 1.3(c), Subcorp shall
be entitled to designate up to such number of directors, rounded to the
nearest whole number constituting at least a majority of the directors, on
the Company Board as will give Subcorp representation on the Company Board
equal to the product of the number of directors on the Company Board (giving
effect to any increase in the number of directors pursuant to this Section
1.3) and the percentage that such number of shares of Company Common Stock so
purchased bears to the total number of outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to, upon Subcorps
request, promptly, at Subcorps election, either increase the size of the
Company Board or secure the resignation of such number of directors as is
necessary to enable Subcorps designees to be elected to the Company Board and
to cause Subcorps designees to be so elected. At such times, subject to
Section 1.3(c), the Company will cause individuals designated by Subcorp to
constitute a majority of each committee of the Company Board, other than any
committee of the Company Board established to take action under this
Agreement which committee shall be composed only of Independent Directors. The
provisions of this Section 1.3(a) are in addition to and not in limitation of
any rights which Subcorp, Parent or any of their affiliates may
otherwise have, subject to the terms of this Section 1.3, as a holder or
beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock.



(b) The Companys obligation to appoint designees to the Company Board shall
be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder.
The Company promptly shall take all action required pursuant to Section 14(f)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder in order to fulfill its
obligations under this Section 1.3, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9
such information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors
as is required pursuant to such Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3
and the United States federal securities laws, provided, that, Subcorp shall
have provided to the Company prior to the filing with the Commission of the
Schedule 14D-9 the information and consents with respect to Subcorp and its
designees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. Subcorp will supply to the Company
in writing any information with  



 

7  respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates
required under the Exchange Act pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 14f-1 thereunder.



(c) In the event that Subcorps designees are elected or designated to the
Company Board, then, until the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the
Company Board to have at least two directors who are directors on the date of
this Agreement, including at least two directors who are (i) selected by such
current directors and (ii) independent directors for purposes of the continued
listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (the " _Nasdaq_ ") (such
directors, the " _Independent Directors_ "), provided, however, that, if any
Independent Director is unable to serve due to death or disability or any
other reason, the remaining Independent Directors shall be entitled to elect
or designate another individual (or individuals) who serve(s) as a director
(or directors) on the date of this Agreement (provided that no such individual
is an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries) to fill the vacancy, and
such director (or directors) shall be deemed to be an Independent Director
(or Independent Directors) for purposes of this Agreement. If no Independent
Director then remains, the other directors shall designate two individuals who
are directors on the date of this Agreement, provided that such individuals
shall not be employees, officers or affiliates of the Company, Parent or
Subcorp (or, in the event there shall be less than two directors available to
fill the vacancies as a result of such individuals deaths, disabilities
or refusals to serve, such smaller number of individuals who are directors on
the date of this Agreement) to fill the vacancies and such directors shall be
deemed Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement. Following the
Appointment Time and prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Subcorp shall
cause any amendment of this Agreement, any termination of this Agreement by
the Company, any extension by the Company of the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of Subcorp or Parent or waiver of any of
the Companys rights under this Agreement, not to be effected without the
affirmative vote of a majority of the Independent Directors; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if there shall be no Independent Directors then in office,
such actions may be authorized by a majority vote of the Company Board in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

2.6. _The Company Shareholders  Meeting_.



(a) As promptly as practicable following the Appointment Time (or, if later,

Restated Articles of Incorporation, as in effect on the date of this Agreement
(the " _Company Articles_ "), and the Companys Amended and Restated By-laws,

(ii) prepare and file with the Commission a preliminary proxy or information
statement relating to this Agreement, and take all lawful actions (A) to
obtain and furnish  



 

9  the information required to be included by the Commission in the Proxy
Statement, and, after consultation with Parent, to respond promptly to any
comments made by the Commission or the SEC Staff with respect to the
preliminary proxy or information statement and cause a definitive proxy or

10 ARTICLE III



CONVERSION OF SECURITIES



3.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Subcorp or the Company or their
respective shareholders and stockholders, as applicable:



(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Subcorp ("
_Subcorp Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Such
newly issued shares shall thereafter constitute all of the issued and
outstanding Surviving Corporation capital stock.



(b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, excluding any shares of Company Common Stock
owned by Parent, Subcorp or the Company or any of their respective
subsidiaries or any shareholders properly exercising rights to dissent
pursuant to Article 5.12 of the TBCA (" _Article 5.12_ "), as provided in
Section 3.1(d), shall be converted into and represent the right to receive in
cash, without interest, an amount equal to the Merger Consideration. At the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and automatically shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration or in the case of holders of Dissent Shares the right to
receive the applicable payments set forth in Section 3.1(d).



(c) Each share of the Company capital stock held in the treasury of the
Company automatically shall be cancelled and retired and no payment shall be
made in respect thereof. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Parent
or any of its subsidiaries shall be cancelled and retired and no payment shall
be made in respect thereof.



(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by any Company Shareholder that is entitled to
demand and properly demands payment of the fair value of such shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to, and that complies in all respects with, the
provisions of Article 5.12 (the " _Dissent_ _Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 3.1(b), but, instead, such Company Shareholder shall be entitled to
such rights (but only such rights) as are granted by Article 5.12. At the
Effective Time, all Dissent Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
automatically shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and, except as
otherwise provided by Applicable Laws, each holder of Dissent Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect to the Dissent Shares, other than such
rights as are granted by Article 5.12. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
such Company Shareholders (i) shall have failed to establish entitlement to
relief as a  



 

11  dissenting shareholder as provided in Article 5.12, (ii) shall have
effectively withdrawn demand for relief as a dissenting shareholder with
respect to such Dissent Shares or lost the right to relief as a dissenting
shareholder and payment for such Dissent Shares under Article 5.12, or (iii)
shall have failed to file a complaint with the appropriate court seeking
relief as to the determination of the value of all such Dissent Shares within
the time provided in Article 5.12, such Company Shareholder shall forfeit or,
in the event a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
Company Shareholder is not entitled to the relief provided by Article 5.12,
lose the right to relief as a dissenting shareholder with respect to such
Dissent Shares, and such Dissent Shares shall be deemed to have been converted
at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(b) without interest. The
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any
shares of Company Common Stock and any attempted withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to the TBCA and received by the
Company relating to shareholder dissent rights, and Parent shall have the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.



(e) The " _Merger Consideration_ " shall be equal to the Per Share Amount.



3.2. _Surrender and Payment_.



(a) Paying Agent and Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, on behalf of
the Company Shareholders, Parent shall designate, or shall cause to be
designated The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. or another bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment
of the Merger Consideration in respect of Certificates, upon surrender of such
Certificates in accordance with this Article III from time to time after the
Effective Time (the " _Paying Agent_ "). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or cause Subcorp to deposit, with the Paying Agent cash in
amounts sufficient for the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 3.1(b) upon surrender of such Certificates (such cash, the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis, provided that no such
investment shall affect Parents obligation to pay the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest and other income resulting from investments of the
Exchange Fund) that remains undistributed to the Company Shareholders one year
after the date of the mailing required by Section 3.2(b) shall be delivered
to Parent, upon demand by Parent, and holders of Certificates that have not
theretofore complied with this Section 3.2 shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of any claim to the Merger Consideration.



(b) Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record
of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
held by such Company Shareholder shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions  



 

12  as Parent may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be reasonably appointed by
Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by the Certificate shall have been converted
pursuant to Section 3.1(b), and the Certificate so surrendered shall be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the Company, the proper
amount of cash may be paid in exchange therefor to a person other than the
person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of
any Certificate.



(c) Stock Transfer Books. At the close of business on the day on which the
Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged as provided in this Article III.



(d) No Liability; Termination of Exchange Fund. None of Parent, Subcorp, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. All funds held by the Paying Agent
for payment to the holders of unsurrendered Certificates and unclaimed one
year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, after which time
any holder of unsurrendered Certificates shall look as a general creditor only
to Parent for payment of the funds to which the holder of
unsurrendered Certificates may be due, subject to Applicable Laws. If any
Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to five years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority), any such cash, dividends
or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted
by all applicable laws, statutes, orders, rules, regulations, policies or
guidelines promulgated, or judgments, decisions or orders entered by any
Governmental Authority (collectively, " _Applicable Laws_ "), become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.



(e) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
a Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with
Section 3.1(b) if the person to whom the Merger Consideration is paid shall,
as a condition  



 

13  precedent to the payment thereof, provide the Surviving Corporation a bond
in such sum as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably direct or
otherwise indemnify the Surviving Corporation in a manner reasonably
satisfactory to it against any claim that may be made against the Surviving
Corporation with respect to the Certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen
or destroyed.



(f) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The
Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article III in
respect of Certificates that have been surrendered in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock represented
thereby.



(g) Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and
withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any Company Shareholders such amounts as it may be required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (together with the rules and regulations thereunder,
the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state or local or foreign Tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld, the withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Company Shareholders in respect of which the deduction and withholding was
made.



3.3. _Treatment of Stock Options_.



(a) At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (collectively, the " _Options_ ") under each of the
Companys 1995 Stock Option Plan, 1995 Director Stock Option Plan and 1999
Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the " _Stock Option Plans_ "), whether or
not then exercisable or fully vested, shall constitute only the right to
receive for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time an amount (subject to any applicable
withholding tax) in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (ii) the amount, if any, by which the Merger Consideration exceeds
the per share exercise price of such Option (such amount being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Option Consideration_ "). Each Option shall be canceled
(i) upon receipt by the holder thereof of the Option Consideration, in the
case of an Option having a per share exercise price less than the Merger
Consideration, and (ii) at the Effective Time, in the case of an Option having
a per share exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration.
The cancellation of an Option as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence shall be deemed a release of any and all rights the holder thereof
had or may have had in respect of such Option. 



(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain all necessary waivers, consents or releases from holders of
Options under the Stock Option Plans and take all such other action, without
incurring any liability in connection therewith, as may be necessary to
give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.3. Except as
otherwise agreed to by the parties, (i) the Stock Option Plans shall terminate
as of the Effective Time and the provisions in any other plan, program or
arrangement providing for  



 

14  the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock
of the Company or any subsidiary thereof shall be canceled as of the
Effective Time and (ii) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
assure that following the Effective Time no participant in the Stock Option
Plans or other plans, programs or arrangements shall have any right thereunder
to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
any subsidiary thereof and to terminate all such plans. As promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Stock Option Plans)
shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as are required to
give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.3. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary to
cause the transactions contemplated hereby and any other dispositions of
equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities), in
connection with this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be approved by
the Company Board or a committee of two or more Non-Employee Directors of the
Company (as such term is defined in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act). Such approval shall specify: (i) the name of each officer or director,
(ii) the number of securities to be disposed of for each named person, and
(iii) that the approval is granted for purposes of exempting the transaction
under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act.

will provide a copy of the signed opinion to Parent solely for information
purposes, and such opinion has not been withdrawn or revoked. The Company has
received the consent of the Company Financial Advisor to include such written
opinion in the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement.



5.24. _Board Recommendation; Required Vote_. The Company Board, at a meeting
duly called and held, has, by unanimous vote of those directors present (who
constituted 100% of the directors then in office), (a) approved this
Agreement, and deemed this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement advisable, fair to and in the
best interests of the Company and the Company Shareholders; (b) approved this
Agreement, the Support Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Support Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, in
all respects, and such approval constitutes approval of the Offer (and the
acquisition of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant thereto), this
Agreement, the Merger, the Support Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by such agreements for purposes of Article 5.03 and
Article 13.03 of the TBCA; and (c) resolved to recommend that the Company
Shareholders accept the Offer, that the Company Shareholders tender their
shares of Company Common Stock under the Offer to Subcorp, and that the
Company Shareholders approve this Agreement to the extent required by
Applicable Laws (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "). The affirmative vote
of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock to
approve this Agreement is the only vote of the holders of any class or series
of Company Common Stock necessary to approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no vote of any holders of any class or
series of the Company capital stock is necessary to approve this Agreement or
approve the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the event that
Subcorp shall acquire at least 90% of the outstanding Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer, other than, subject to the satisfaction of or, to the
extent permitted under this Agreement, waiver of all conditions to the Merger,
in accordance with Article 5.16 of the TBCA.



5.25. _Article 13.03 of the TBCA_. Prior to the date of this Agreement, the
Company Board has taken all action necessary to exempt under or make not
subject to (a) the provisions of Article 13.03 of the TBCA or (b) any "fair
price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other state takeover law
or state law that purports to limit or restrict business combinations or the
ability to acquire or vote shares: (i) the execution of this Agreement and the
Support Agreement, (ii) the Offer, (iii) the Merger and (iv) the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Support Agreement.

The parties hereto agree that:



6.1. _Mutual Covenants_.



(a) HSR Act Filings; Reasonable Efforts; Notification.



(i) Each of Parent and the Company shall (A) make or cause to be made the
filings required of such party hereto or any of its subsidiaries or
affiliates under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as promptly as practicable and in any event within five
business days after the date of this Agreement, (B) comply at the earliest
practicable date with any request under the HSR Act for additional
information, documents, or other materials received by such party hereto or
any of its subsidiaries from the United States Federal Trade Commission or the
United States Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority in
respect of such filings or such transactions, and (C) cooperate with the other
party in connection with any such filing (including, with respect to the party
hereto making a filing, providing copies of all such documents to the non-
filing party and its advisors prior to filing and, if requested, to accept all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith)
and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any
such agency or other Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Laws with
respect to any such filing or any such transaction. Each party hereto shall
use all reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all information
required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any
Applicable Laws in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each party hereto shall promptly inform the
other parties hereto of any communication with, and any proposed
understanding, undertaking, or agreement with, any Governmental Authority
regarding any such filings or any such transaction. No party hereto shall
independently participate in any meeting, or engage in any substantive
conversation, with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings,
investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other party hereto prior
notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, the opportunity to attend and/or participate. The parties hereto
will consult and cooperate with one another, in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection
with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws.
Each of the parties hereto will use all reasonable best efforts to secure
termination of any waiting periods under the HSR Act and obtain the approval
of any other Governmental Authority for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other under this Section 6.1 "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel
of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission
is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the
Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.



(ii) Each of Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended,
the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other United States
federal or state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative or judicial doctrines or other laws that are designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect
of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ ").
In connection  



 

36  therewith, if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
violative of any Antitrust Laws, each of Parent and the Company shall
cooperate and use all reasonable best efforts vigorously to contest and resist
any such Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts
consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of
administrative and judicial appeal unless, by mutual agreement, Parent and the
Company decide that litigation is not in their respective best interests.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 6.1(a) shall limit a party heretos right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, so long as such party hereto
has, up to the time of termination, complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this Section 6.1(a). Each of Parent and the Company shall
use all reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to
cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement. 

---|--- 



(iii) Each of the parties hereto agrees to use all reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner reasonably practicable, the Offer, the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (A) the obtaining
of all other necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, licenses,
permits, authorizations, orders and approvals from Governmental Authorities
and the making of all other necessary registrations and filings (including
other filings with Governmental Authorities, if any), (B) the obtaining of all
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties related to or required in
connection with the Offer and the Merger that are necessary to consummate the
Offer and the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
required to prevent a Material Adverse Effect on the Company from occurring
prior to or after the Effective Time, and (C) the execution and delivery of
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement.
Additionally, each of Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable best
efforts to fulfill all conditions precedent to the Offer (as set forth in
Annex A) and to the Merger.



(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (A) neither
Parent nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to hold separate
(including by trust or otherwise) or to divest any of their respective
businesses or assets, or to take or agree to take any action or agree to any
limitation with respect to the ownership, operation or holding of any of their
respective businesses or assets, (B) neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries shall be required to hold separate (including by trust or
otherwise) or to divest any of their respective businesses or assets, or to
take or agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation with
respect to the ownership, operation or holding of any of their respective
businesses or assets, (C) neither any party hereto nor their respective
subsidiaries shall be required to take any action that would, or
would reasonably be expected to, substantially impair the benefits expected,
as of the date of  



 

37  this Agreement, to be realized by Parent or the shareholders and
optionholders of the Company from consummation of the Offer and the Merger,
(D) neither Parent nor Subcorp shall be required to waive any of the
conditions of the Offer set forth in Annex A, and (E) no party hereto shall be
required to waive any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII
as they apply to such party. 



(b) _Public Announcements_. The initial press release concerning the Merger
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be a joint press
release. Parent, Subcorp and the Company will use their respective reasonable
best efforts to comply in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the United States federal securities laws
including by filing the initial press release and other such communications as
are required to be filed with the Commission. At all times prior to the
earlier of the Effective Time or termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1, Parent and the Company shall obtain the other partys consent
(which shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) before
issuing any press release with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as may be required by
Applicable Laws or requirements of the Nasdaq (in which case such party shall
not issue or cause the publication of such press release or other
public announcement without prior consultation with the other party).



(c) _Conveyance Taxes_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains,
sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees, and any similar Taxes that
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the
Effective Time.



6.2. _Covenants of Parent_.



(a) _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.



(i) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, hold harmless
and advance expenses to the present and former officers and directors of the
Company (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ")
in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time to the
extent provided under the Company Articles, as amended pursuant to
Section 2.4.



(ii) Parent shall cause to obtained and maintained in effect, for a period of
six years after the Effective Time, policies of directors and officers
liability insurance covering each person who was covered under the policies of
directors and officers liability maintained by the Company as of the date
of this Agreement and immediately prior to the Appointment Time at no cost to
the beneficiaries thereof with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to
the Effective Time with substantially the same coverage and containing
substantially similar terms and conditions as such existing policies;
provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to pay an aggregate
premium for such insurance coverage in excess of 200% of the amounts
calculated as set forth in Section 5.22 to the Company Disclosure Schedule,
but, in such case, shall purchase as  



 

38  much coverage as shall be available at an annual premium of 200% of the
current aggregate premium and Parent may substitute therefor other policies
not less advantageous (excluding de minimis differences) to the beneficiaries
of the current policies and provided that such substitution shall not result
in any gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to
the Effective Time.  

---|--- 



(iii) The provisions of this Section 6.2(a) are (A) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (B) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person
may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 6.2(a) shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom
this Section 6.2(a) applies unless (x) such termination or modification is
required by Applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented
in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 6.2(a) applies shall be
third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.2(a)).



(iv) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (A) consolidates or merges into any other
person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties or assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this Section 6.2(a).



(b) _Employees and Employee Benefits_. Parent shall, for a period of six
months immediately following the Effective Time, cause the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries to provide individuals who were employees of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries as of the Effective Time and who are
employees of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time (" _Company Employees_ ") with (i) the same level of base salary as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefit
plans, programs, contracts and arrangements that are no less favorable, in
the aggregate, than similar employee benefit plans, programs, contracts and
arrangements (excluding incentive and equity-based plans, programs, contracts
or arrangements) provided by the Company and its subsidiaries to
Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however,
that Parent shall for such period of six months provide to Company Employees a
bonus opportunity no less favorable to such Company Employees as was available
to them immediately before the Effective Time. Parent or one of its
affiliates shall recognize the service of Company Employees with the Company
prior to the Effective Time as service with Parent and its affiliates in
connection with any tax-qualified pension plan, 401(k) savings plan, welfare
benefit plans and policies (including vacations and holiday policies)
maintained by Parent or one of its affiliates which is made available
following the Effective Time by Parent or one of its affiliates for purposes
of any waiting period, vesting, eligibility and benefit entitlement (but
excluding benefit accruals). Parent shall (x) waive, or cause its insurance
carriers to waive, all limitations as to pre-existing and at-work conditions,
if any, with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
Company Employees under any welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1)
of  



 

39  ERISA) which is made available to Company Employees following the Effective
Time by Parent or one of its affiliates, and (y) provide credit to
Company Employees for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses
paid by such employees under the employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements of the Company and its subsidiaries during the portion of the
relevant plan year including the Effective Time.



6.3. _Covenants of the Company_. 



(a) _Conduct of the Company s Operations_. Except as expressly contemplated
by this Agreement, as required by Applicable Law or as expressly permitted by
or disclosed in Section 6.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, during the
period from the date of this Agreement to the Appointment Time, unless Parent
otherwise consents, the Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to,
conduct its operations in the ordinary course in substantially the same manner
as previously conducted, and, consistent with the terms of this Section
6.3(a), shall use all reasonable best efforts to maintain and preserve its
business organization and its material rights and franchises and to retain the
services of its officers and key employees and maintain relationships with
customers, suppliers, lessees, licensees and other third parties, and to
maintain all of its operating assets in their current condition (normal wear
and tear excepted), to the end that its goodwill and ongoing business shall
not be impaired in any material respect. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, during the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Appointment Time, the Company shall not, except as otherwise expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, as required by Applicable Law or as
expressly permitted by or disclosed in Section 6.3(a) to the Company
Disclosure Schedule, without the prior written consent of Parent:

the restrictive provisions thereof and not exempt therefrom;



(xx) take any action that would reasonably be likely to result in (A) any

42 (b) _No Solicitation_. The Company agrees that, during the term of this
Agreement, it shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its
subsidiaries or any directors, officers, employees, investment bankers,
lawyers, accountants, agents or representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") of it or its subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:
(i) solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate, or furnish or otherwise
disclose nonpublic information in furtherance of, or take any other action to
facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or
may reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Transaction, (ii) negotiate
or otherwise engage or participate in discussions with any person (other than
Parent, Subcorp or their respective Representatives) with respect to
any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to a
Competing Transaction or (iii) enter into any Acquisition Agreement with
respect to a Competing Transaction or any agreement, arrangement or
understanding requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , in each case, that, at any time prior to the
Appointment Time, the Company may furnish or otherwise disclose information
to, and negotiate or otherwise engage or participate in discussions with, any
person that delivers a written proposal for a Competing Transaction that was
not solicited, encouraged or facilitated by the Company and that did
not otherwise result from a breach or deemed breach of this Section 6.3(b) if
and so long as the Company Board (A) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failing to take such action
is reasonably likely to cause the Company Board to violate its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Laws and (B) determines, after consultation with the
Company Financial Advisor (or any other nationally recognized investment
banking firm), that such a proposal is or is reasonably likely to lead to a
transaction that is more favorable to the Company Shareholders from a
financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
taking into account, among other things, the likelihood and
anticipated timing of consummation and all legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of the proposal (any proposal with respect to which the Company
Board has made the determination described in clause (B), a " _Superior
Proposal_ "), provided, further, that, prior to furnishing or otherwise
disclosing any information to such person, the Company shall enter into a
confidentiality agreement that is no less restrictive, in any respect, than
the Confidentiality Agreement, as modified by this Agreement. The Company
immediately will cease all existing activities, discussions and negotiations
with any person conducted heretofore with respect to any proposal that
constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Transaction.
In the event that, prior to the Appointment Time, the Company Board after
consultation with its outside legal counsel determines that failure to do so
would be reasonably likely to cause the Company Board to violate
its fiduciary duties under Applicable Laws, the Company Board may (subject to
this and the following sentences) withdraw, modify or change, in a manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation and/or comply with Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act, provided that the Company gives Parent at least
2 business days prior written notice of its intention to do so (provided that
the foregoing shall in no way limit or otherwise affect Parents right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)). Any such withdrawal,
modification or change of the Company Board Recommendation shall not change
the approval of the Company Board for purposes of causing any state takeover
statute (including Article 13.03 of the TBCA) or other state law to be
inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Offer, the Merger, or the Support Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by such agreements. From and after the execution of this Agreement,
the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally, and within 24 hours advise
Parent in writing, of  



 

43  the receipt, directly or indirectly, of any inquiries or proposals or
participation in discussions or negotiations, relating to a proposal that
constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Transaction
(including the material terms thereof and the identity of the other person or
persons involved). In addition, the Company shall promptly advise Parent
orally, and within 24 hours advise Parent in writing, if the Company Board
shall make any determination as to any Competing Transaction as contemplated
by the proviso to the first sentence of this Section 6.3(b). Nothing contained
in this Section 6.3(b) or any other provision of this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from, at any time, taking and disclosing to the Company
Shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act so long as the requirements set forth in this Section 6.3(b) are
satisfied. " _Competing Transaction_ " means (i) any proposal or offer for a
merger, consolidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other business
combination involving the Company, (ii) any proposal for the issuance by
the Company of over 30% of its equity securities as consideration for the
assets or securities of another person or (iii) any proposal or offer to
acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, over 30% of the equity
securities or consolidated total assets of the Company, in a single
transaction or series of related transactions, in each case other than the
transactions provided for in this Agreement and the Support Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in the first sentence of this Section 6.3(b) by any Representative
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Section 6.3(b) by the Company. It is understood and agreed that
for purposes of this Agreement (including Section 8.1(d)) a factually
accurate public statement by the Company that describes the Companys receipt
of a proposal for a Competing Transaction and the operation of this Agreement
with respect thereto shall not be deemed a withdrawal or modification, or
proposal by the Company Board to withdraw or modify the Company Boards
recommendation of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder,
or an approval or recommendation with respect to such proposal for a
Competing Transaction.



(c)  _Fiduciary Right of Termination_. If, prior to the Appointment Time, the
Company Board shall determine in good faith, after consultation with the
Company Financial Advisor and the Companys outside legal counsel, that any
unsolicited written proposal from a third party for a Competing Transaction
received after the date of this Agreement continues to be a Superior Proposal
and the Company Board has determined, following consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to enter into such a Competing Transaction
would be reasonably likely to cause the Company Board to violate its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Laws, the Company may terminate this Agreement and
enter into a letter of intent, agreement-in-principle, acquisition agreement
or other similar agreement (each, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") with respect
to such Competing Transaction, provided, the Company shall have at all times
after the date of this Agreement complied with the provisions of Section
6.3(b) and provided, further, that, prior to any such termination:



(i) the Company has provided Parent written notice of such determination and
that it intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(i),
identifying the material terms of the Competing Transaction and the parties
thereto; and



(ii) (x) at least three business days have elapsed following the delivery to
Parent of the written notice and other materials contemplated by the
foregoing clause (i) and during such three business day period, the Company
cooperates with Parent with  



 

44  respect to the Competing Transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal
with the intent of enabling Parent to engage in good faith negotiations to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Offer and the Merger
as would enable Parent to proceed with the Offer and Merger on such adjusted
terms and (y) at the end of such three business day period the Company Board
continues reasonably to believe that the Competing Transaction constitutes a
Superior Proposal. 

---|--- 



(d) _Access_. The Company shall permit Representatives of Parent to have
access at all reasonable times to the Companys premises, properties, books,
records, contracts and documents. The Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to assist in facilitating and arranging meetings and discussions
between Representatives of Parent and the Companys customers and suppliers at
reasonable times during normal business hours. Parent will keep
the information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.3(d) confidential

condition is not reasonably capable of being satisfied within fifteen business
days after the receipt of notice thereof shall have been received by the
Company;



(g) by the Company, at any time prior to the Appointment Time, if there has
been a breach by Parent or Subcorp of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement set forth in this Agreement, which breach would reasonably be

without any liability on the part of any party hereto or its directors,
officers or shareholders or stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Section 8.2 shall relieve any party hereto of liability for an
intentional breach of any provision of this Agreement. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 prior to the Appointment
Time, Parent and Subcorp  



 

47  will promptly terminate the Offer upon such termination of this Agreement
without the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock thereunder.

of the Termination Fee shall be made on the date of execution of such
Acquisition Agreement or, if earlier, consummation of such transactions).

authorization by the Company Shareholders without such further approval or
authorization. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may not be

parties hereto.



8.4. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
Subcorp (with respect to the Company) and the Company (with respect to Parent

48  taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors (which in the

Section 1.3(c)), may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of such party hereto,
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement and (c)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension

of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of such rights.

force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provisions in invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to

shall not have expired or been terminated prior to the Expiration Date, or

decree by a Governmental Authority shall prohibit or enjoin the purchase of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or the consummation of
the Merger or shall make consummation of the Offer or the Merger illegal;



(b) there shall be pending any Action by any Governmental Authority (i)
seeking to restrain or prohibit the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer or the consummation of the Merger or seeking to obtain
from the Company, Parent or Subcorp any damages that are material in relation
to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) seeking to
prohibit or materially limit the ownership or operation by Parent, the Company
or any of their respective subsidiaries of, or to compel Parent, the Company

portion of the business or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective subsidiaries, in each case, as a result of the purchase of shares

or Material Adverse Effect, shall not be true and correct as of the date of
determination, as if such representations and warranties were made at the time
of such determination (except as to any such representation or warranty which
speaks as of a specific date, which must be untrue or incorrect as of

the representation and warranty contained in Section 5.4(a) of the Agreement,

rise to any such conditions, and, except for the Minimum Condition, may be
waived by Parent or Subcorp in whole or in part at any time and from time to
time, subject to the terms of the Agreement. The failure by Parent or Subcorp
at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a
waiver of any such right and, each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right
which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.



The term " _Fully Diluted Shares_ " means all outstanding securities
generally entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company on a

the right to be paid or reimbursed by the Corporation for expenses incurred
in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition to the
maximum extent permitted under the Texas Business Corporation Act, as the same
exists or may hereafter be amended. If a claim for indemnification or
advancement of expenses hereunder is not paid in full by the Corporation
within 90 days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the
claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to
recover the unpaid amount of the claim, and if successful, the claimant shall
be entitled to be paid also the expenses of prosecuting such claim. It shall
be a defense to any such action that such indemnification or advancement of
costs of defense are not permitted under the Texas Business Corporation Act,
but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither
the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or any
committee thereof, special legal counsel, or shareholders) to have made
its determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification of, or advancement of costs of defense to, the claimant is
permissible in the circumstances nor an actual determination by the
Corporation (including its Board of Directors or any committee thereof,
special legal counsel, or shareholders) that such indemnification or
advancement is not permissible, shall be a defense to the action or create a
presumption that such indemnification or advancement is not permissible.
In the event of the death of any person having a right of indemnification
under the foregoing provisions, such right shall inure to the benefit of his
heirs, executors, administrators, and personal representatives. The rights
conferred above shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person
may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, bylaw, resolution of
shareholders or directors, agreement, or otherwise.



The Corporation may additionally indemnify any person covered by the grant of
mandatory indemnification contained above to such further extent as is
permitted by law and may indemnify any other person to the fullest extent
permitted by law.



To the extent permitted by then applicable law, the grant of mandatory
indemnification to any person pursuant to this Article X shall extend
to proceedings involving the negligence of such person.



As used herein, the term "proceeding" means any threatened, pending, or
completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, arbitrative, or investigative, any appeal in such an action,
suit, or proceeding, and any inquiry or investigation that could lead to such
an action, suit, or proceeding.
