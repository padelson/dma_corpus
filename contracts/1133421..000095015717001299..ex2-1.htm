Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

  


 

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent, Sub and the Company has
approved this Agreement;

  


 

  

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Sub deems it in the
best interests of their respective stockholders to consummate the merger (the
" _Merger_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, of Sub with and into the Company in which the Company would survive
and become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and such Boards of Directors
have approved this Agreement, declared its advisability and recommended that
this Agreement be adopted by the stockholders of the Company or Sub, as the
case may be; and

  


 

  

WHEREAS, Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to
prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

  


 

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

  


 

  

ARTICLE I 
  
  _The Merger_

  


 

  

SECTION 1.01. _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

  


 

  

SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on a date to be specified by the
parties, which shall be not later than the second business day after
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article VI (other than those that by their terms are to be satisfied
or waived at the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the
Closing shall remain subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such

  


 

  


 

    

   

  

conditions at Closing), at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825
Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019, unless another time, date or place is
agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if all the conditions set forth in Article VI shall not have been satisfied or
(to the extent permitted by Law) waived on such second business day, then the
Closing shall take place on the first business day on which all such
conditions shall have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law)
waived. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement
as the " _Closing Date_ ".

  


 

  

SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time of the Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, as soon as practicable on or after
the Closing Date, the parties shall properly file a certificate of merger (the
" _Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form as is required by, and executed and
acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at such date and time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, at such subsequent date and time as
Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger.
The date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Effective Time_ ".

  


 

  

SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

  


 

  

SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws._ (a) The certificate
of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be amended by virtue of the Merger at the Effective Time
to read in its entirety as set forth on Exhibit A hereto and, as so amended,
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law and, in
each case, subject to Section 5.06.

  


 

  

(b) The bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be amended at the Effective Time to read in the same form as the
bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except
that references therein to the name of Sub shall be replaced by references to
Orbital ATK, Inc.) and, as so amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law and, in each case, subject to Section 5.06.

  


 

  

SECTION 1.06. _Directors._ The directors of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their

  

  

 

2  

  


  resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  

  

SECTION 1.07. _Officers._ The officers of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  


 

  

ARTICLE II 
  
  _Conversion of Securities_

  


 

  

SECTION 2.01. _Conversion of Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company
Common Stock_ "), or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Sub:

  


 

  

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of common stock
of Sub, par value $0.01 per share, shall be converted into and become one
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

(b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ All shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned as treasury stock by the Company or owned
by Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
or deliverable in exchange therefor.

  


 

  

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i)
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and (ii) except as
provided in Section 2.02, the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the
right to receive $134.50 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time such shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or evidence of shares in
book-entry form (" _Uncertificated Shares_ "), in each case, that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The right of any
holder of any share of Company

  

  

 

3  

  

  

Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to
withholding as provided in Section 2.04(f).

  


 

  

SECTION 2.02. _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held
by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but
instead, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate or evidence in book entry form that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such
shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the
fair value of such holder's Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and
such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective
Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt
notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common
Stock, withdrawals of any such demands and any other related instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL that are received by the Company, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, or otherwise
negotiate, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the
foregoing.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.03. _Adjustments._ If at any time during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
Company Common Stock shall occur by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, split or combination (including a reverse stock split),
exchange, merger, consolidation or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend thereon with a record date during such period, or any similar
transaction or event, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly
dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately and equitably
adjusted to provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this
Section 2.03 shall

  

  

 

4  

  

  

be construed as permitting the Company to take any action or enter into any
transaction otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.04. _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of Certificates and Uncertificated Shares (the "
_Paying Agent_ "), and in connection therewith, shall enter into an agreement
with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. Prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the
benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, cash in immediately
available funds (such cash in immediately available funds, the " _Exchange
Fund_ ") in an amount necessary for the payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) upon surrender of Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares, it being understood that all such funds shall be
invested as directed by Parent and that any and all interest or other amounts
earned with respect to funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to
this Agreement shall be turned over to Parent. If for any reason (including
losses) the Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled under Section
2.01(c), Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, in the
Exchange Fund additional cash in immediately available funds so as to ensure
that the Exchange Fund has sufficient funds available for Paying Agent to make
all such payments.

  


 

  

(b) _Exchange Procedure._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event later than two business days thereafter), the
Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to (i)
each holder of record of a Certificate (A) a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall include an accompanying IRS Form W‑9 or the applicable IRS Form
W‑8, shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of such Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a customary form and
have such other provisions as reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company)
and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration and (ii) each holder of Uncertificated
Shares (A) materials advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger
and the conversion of its Uncertificated Shares into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and (B) a check in an amount equal to the aggregate
amount of Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancelation to the Paying Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of
cash equal to the Merger

  

  

 

5  

  

  

Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.01(c), and each Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the stock transfer books of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration in exchange therefor may be made to a person other than the
person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.04, each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which
the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate, as applicable, have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01(c).
No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender
of any Certificate.

  


 

  

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the
terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate. After the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.
No cash payment with respect to the Merger Consideration shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.04.

  


 

  

(d) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any Merger Consideration that would otherwise have been payable to a holder of
a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares which is delivered to a public official
in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
If any holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares has not received the
Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to under this Section 2.04,
and such Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, such Merger Consideration shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such

  

  

 

6  

  

  

date, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  


 

  

(e) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond
in such reasonable and customary amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall pay the Merger Consideration in respect of such lost,
stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate.

  


 

  

(f) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
and any other amounts otherwise payable to any person pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
") or any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

  


 

  

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ At any time following the six-month
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund or that had
otherwise been made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.04(a)
and that have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares, and thereafter, subject to the time limitations in Section 2.04(d),
such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by
such holders or to holders of Uncertificated Shares, as applicable, as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

ARTICLE III 
  
  _Representations and Warranties_

  


 

  

SECTION 3.01. _Representations and Warranties of the Company._ Except as set
forth in (x) the letter delivered by the Company to Parent on or prior to the
date of this Agreement (the " _Company Letter_ ") (with specific reference to
the Section of this Agreement to which the information stated in such
disclosure relates; _provided_ that disclosure of information in any section
of the Company Letter shall be deemed to qualify or apply to other Sections in
this Article III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure that such disclosure is relevant to such other Sections) or (y) the
Filed SEC Documents filed on or after January 1, 2016, other than any
disclosure contained therein under the caption "Risk Factors" or "Forward-
Looking Statements" or any other disclosure contained therein of information,
factors or risks that are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature
and not statements of historical fact (it being agreed that any matter
disclosed in such Filed SEC Documents shall be deemed to qualify this Article
III only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure the Section or Sections of this Article III to which such
disclosure is relevant), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub
as follows:

  


 

  

(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power._ Each of the Company and each
Subsidiary of the Company (i) is a corporation or other legal entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization (except, in the case of good standing, for
entities organized under the Laws of any jurisdiction that does not recognize
such concept), (ii) has all requisite corporate, company, partnership or other
organizational power and authority to enable it to own, lease or otherwise
hold its properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently
conducted and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction (except, in the case of good standing, any
jurisdiction that does not recognize such concept) in which the nature of its
business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than where the failure
to be so organized, existing, qualified or licensed or in good standing
(except, in the case of clause (i) above, with respect to the Company), or to
have such power or authority, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
has made available to Parent true and complete copies of the certificate of
incorporation of the Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (the "
_Company Certificate_ "), the bylaws of the Company, as amended to the date of
this Agreement (the " _Company Bylaws_ ") and the

  

  

 

8  

  

  

certificate or articles of incorporation and bylaws or comparable
organizational documents of each Subsidiary of the Company, in each case as
amended to the date of this Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) _Subsidiaries._ Section 3.01(b) of the Company Letter sets forth a list as
of the date of this Agreement of each Subsidiary of the Company and its place
and form of organization. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interests in, each such Subsidiary of the Company are
owned by the Company, by one or more wholly owned Subsidiaries of the Company
or by the Company and one or more wholly owned Subsidiaries of the Company,
free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, options, security
interests or other encumbrances of any kind or nature whatsoever
(collectively, " _Liens_ "), and free and clear of any other restriction
(including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or dispose of such
capital stock or other equity or voting interest), except for transfer
restrictions imposed by applicable securities Laws, and are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and not subject to or issued in
violation of any purchase option, call option, right of first refusal,
preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right. Except for the
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, Subsidiaries of the
Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries own, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, or
any interest convertible into or exchangeable for any capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interest in, any person.

  


 

  

(c) _Capital Structure._ (i) The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 180,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the " _Company
Preferred Stock_ "). At the close of business on September 8, 2017 (such date
and time, the " _Measurement Time_ "), (A) 57,621,261 shares of Company Common
Stock (excluding treasury shares but including 302,247 shares of Company
Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans and subject to forfeiture

entitling the holders thereof to receive an aggregate of 94,524 shares of
Company Common Stock and phantom stock units granted under the Benefit Plans

Stock Units and the Company Phantom Stock Units collectively, the " _Company
Equity-Based Awards_ ") and (D) 1,820,525 shares of Company Common Stock were
reserved and available for issuance pursuant to the Company ESPP. As of the
date of this Agreement, none of the issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock (other than the Company Restricted Shares) are subject to vesting
or forfeiture conditions or a right of repurchase by the Company. All
outstanding Company Equity-Based Awards have been granted under the Company

the Company Stock Plans or Company ESPP or otherwise from the Company, on a
deferred basis or otherwise.

  


 

  

(ii) Except for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and Company Equity-
Based Awards, as of the Measurement Time, no shares of capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interests in, the Company, or securities convertible
into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, any such capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, the Company were issued, reserved for issuance
or outstanding. From the Measurement Time to the date of this Agreement, (A)
there have been no issuances by the Company of shares of capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interests in, the Company, other than issuances of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the exercise or settlement of
Company Equity-Based Awards outstanding as of the Measurement Time pursuant to

voting interests in, the Company, or other securities that are linked to the
value of Company Common Stock or the value of the Company or any part thereof.

  


 

  

(iii) All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are, and all
shares that may be issued prior to the Effective Time will be when issued,
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject
to or issued in violation of any purchase option, call option, right of first

any matter on which stockholders of the Company or its Subsidiaries may vote
or (B) securities or other instruments or rights (including stock appreciation
rights, phantom stock awards or other similar rights) issued by, or other
obligations of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, that are
linked to, or the value of which is in any way based upon or derived from, the
value of any class of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests
in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the value of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any part thereof, or any dividends or other distributions
declared or paid on any shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or which have or which
by their terms may have at any time (whether actual or contingent) the right
to vote (or which are convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having
the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries may vote (the items referred to in clauses (A) and (B)
collectively, " _Equity Equivalents_ "). Except as set forth in this Section
3.01(c), there are no securities, options, warrants, calls, rights or
Contracts of any kind to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound, (x)
obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell,

or voting interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (y) obligating
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into
any such security, option, warrant, call, right or Contract or (z) that give

11  

  

  

person the right to receive any economic benefit or right similar to or
derived from the economic benefits and rights accruing to holders of capital
stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except pursuant to the
forfeiture conditions of the Company Equity-Based Awards outstanding as of the
date of this Agreement and except pursuant to any cashless exercise or Tax
withholding provisions of or authorizations related to such Company Equity-
Based Awards as in effect on the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding contractual or other obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to (I) repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or (II) vote or dispose of any shares of capital stock of,
or other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any voting agreement with respect to any shares of capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and, to
the knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement there are no
irrevocable proxies and no voting agreements with respect to any shares of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

consummation of the Merger, to obtaining the Stockholder Approval. The

contemplated by this Agreement and compliance by the Company with the
provisions of this Agreement do not and will not conflict with, or result in
any violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or result in, termination,
cancelation, first offer, first refusal, modification or acceleration of any

13  

  

  

losses, Liens, rights or entitlements that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect and
would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially
delay the consummation by the Company of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. No consent, waiver, approval, order or
authorization (" _Consent_ ") of or from, or registration, declaration or
filing with, or notice to, any Federal, state or local, domestic or foreign
government or any court, administrative agency or commission or other
governmental, quasi‑governmental or regulatory authority or agency, domestic

which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is qualified to do business, (IV)
any filings required under the rules and regulations of the New York Stock
Exchange and (V) such other Consents the failure of which to be obtained or
made, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect and would not reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation by the Company
of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

(e) _SEC Documents._ (i) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable,
all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents with the SEC

required. No Subsidiary of the Company is, or has been, required to file or
furnish any report, schedule, form, statement or other document with, or make
any other filing with, or furnish any other material to, the SEC. As of their
respective effective dates (in the case of SEC Documents that are registration
statements filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the " _Securities
Act_ ")) and as of their respective filing dates (in the case of all other SEC

Document, and none of the SEC Documents at the time it was filed or furnished
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Except to the extent that information contained in any SEC
Document filed or furnished and publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement (a " _Filed SEC Document_ ") has been amended, restated, revised or
superseded by a later filed or furnished Filed SEC Document, none of the SEC
Documents contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,

unresolved comments in any comment letters received by the Company from the
SEC relating to the SEC Documents. As of the date of this Agreement, to the

Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended

  

  

  

 

15

recurring year-end adjustments that are immaterial in nature). Except as
reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company
included in the Company's financial statements (or the notes thereto) included
in the Filed SEC Documents, the Company and its Subsidiaries have no material
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that are required to be recorded as a liability or
disclosed by GAAP in the financial statements or footnotes thereto other than
liabilities or obligations that (A) were incurred after the date of the latest

contained in such certifications were accurate as of the date they were made.
For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in SOX. Neither

any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act)) where the purpose
or intended or known result or effect of such joint venture, partnership or
Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in

  

  

 

16  

  

  

the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' published financial statements or
other SEC Documents.

  


 

  

(v) The Company maintains "internal control over financial reporting" (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) and "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as required by

adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that

by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the time it is filed with the
SEC, at the date it is first mailed to the Company's stockholders, at the time
of the Stockholders Meeting or at the time of any amendment or supplement
thereof, as amended or supplemented at such date or time, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no
representation is made by the Company with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form
in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act.

whole, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no facts or circumstances exist
that are reasonably likely to give rise to a violation of, or a liability
under, any applicable Law that, individually or in the aggregate, would

Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the Company, the Controlled Affiliate,

Stockholder Approval or the consummation of the Merger or any other

Agreement and compliance with the terms of this Agreement, the restrictions on
"business combinations" (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) set forth in
Section 203 of the DGCL to the extent, if any, such restrictions would
otherwise be applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or compliance with the terms of this Agreement.
No other state takeover or similar statute or regulation, and, assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties in Section 3.02(e), no
analogous provision in the Company Certificate or the Company Bylaws, is
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

other matters set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be received by
the stockholders of the Company (other than holders of (i) shares to be
canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and (ii) Appraisal Shares)
pursuant to this Agreement is fair to such stockholders from a financial point
of view, a copy of which opinion will be delivered to Parent, for

receipt thereof by the Company.

  


 

  

(y) _Disclaimer._ Except as set forth in this Section 3.01, none of the

affiliates. Any such other representation or warranty is hereby expressly
disclaimed. In particular, without limiting the foregoing disclaimer, except
for the representations and warranties made by Company in this Section 3.01,
none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates or
Representatives makes or has made any representation or warranty to Parent or
any of its affiliates or Representatives with respect to (i) any financial
projection, forecast, estimate or budget of future results or future financial
condition relating to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses, or (ii) any oral or written information presented to Parent or any
of its affiliates or Representatives in the course of their due diligence
investigation of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses, the negotiation of this Agreement or in the course of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  


 

  

SECTION 3.02. _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Sub._ Parent and
Sub represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

  


 

  

(a) _Organization._ Each of Parent and Sub is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization and has all requisite corporate power and authority to enable
it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as currently conducted.

  


 

  

(b) _Authority; Noncontravention._ Each of Parent and Sub has the requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to comply with the provisions of this Agreement (subject, in the
case of the Merger, to the adoption of this Agreement by Parent, as the sole
stockholder of Sub). The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent
and Sub, the consummation by Parent and Sub of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the compliance by Parent and
Sub with the provisions of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Sub, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Sub are necessary to authorize
this Agreement, to comply with the terms of this Agreement or to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (subject,
in the case of the Merger, to the adoption of this Agreement by Parent, as the
sole stockholder of Sub). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by Parent and Sub, as applicable, and, assuming the due execution and delivery
of this Agreement by the Company, constitutes a valid and binding obligation
of Parent and Sub, as applicable, enforceable against Parent and Sub, as
applicable,

  

  

  

 

40  

  

  

in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency (including all Laws related to fraudulent transfers),
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and subject to the effect of general principles of equity. The
execution and delivery by Parent and Sub of this Agreement, the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
compliance by Parent and Sub with the provisions of this Agreement do not and
will not conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, any provision of (i)
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational
documents) of Parent or Sub, (ii) any Contract or Permit to or by which Parent
or Sub is a party or bound or to or by which their respective properties or
assets are subject or bound or otherwise under which Parent or Sub has rights
or benefits or (iii) subject to the governmental filings and other matters
referred to in the following sentence, any Law applicable to Parent or Sub or
their respective properties or assets (assuming receipt of the Stockholder
Approval and the adoption of this Agreement by Parent, as the sole stockholder
of Sub), other than any such conflicts, violations, breaches or defaults that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. No Consent of or from, or registration,
declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental Entity is required
by or with respect to Parent or Sub in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Sub, the consummation by Parent and
Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the compliance by Parent and Sub with the provisions of this Agreement, except
for (v) the filing of a premerger notification and report form and the
expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act and the
filings and receipt, termination or expiration, as applicable, of such other
approvals or waiting periods required under any other applicable competition,
merger control, antitrust or similar Law, (w) the filing by the Company with
the SEC of the Proxy Statement and such reports under the Exchange Act as may
be required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (x) the filing of the Certificate
of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and appropriate
documents with the relevant authorities of other jurisdictions in which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is qualified to do business, (y) any
filings required under the rules and regulations of the New York Stock
Exchange and (z) such other Consents the failure of which to be obtained or
made, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

 

41  

  

  

(c) _Information Supplied._ None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by Parent or Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Proxy Statement will, at the time it is filed with the SEC, at the date
the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Company's stockholders, at the time
of the Stockholders Meeting or at the time of any amendment or supplement
thereof, as amended or supplemented at such date or time, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that,
for the avoidance of doubt, no representation is made by Parent or Sub with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement.

  


 

  

(d) _Interim Operations of Sub._ Sub was formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and has engaged in no business other than in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

(e) _No Ownership of Company Capital Stock._ Neither Parent nor Sub, nor any
of their respective Subsidiaries (nor any of their respective "Associates" as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL), is or has been during the past three
years an "interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203 of
the DGCL. Neither Parent nor Sub nor any of their respective Subsidiaries is,
nor during the two-year period immediately prior to the date of this Agreement
has been, the beneficial owner of Company Common Stock representing 10% or
more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

  


 

  

(f) _Financing._ Parent will have on the Closing Date sufficient funds
available (through credit arrangements or otherwise) to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration and all related fees and expenses required to be paid by
Parent and the Surviving Corporation. Parent has delivered to the Company true
and complete copies of (i) an executed commitment letter, from Parent's
Financing Sources (such commitment letter or any replacement commitment letter
as contemplated by Section 5.07(a), the " _Commitment Letter_ ") pursuant to
which Parent's Financing Sources have agreed, subject to the terms and
conditions therein, to provide the debt financing for the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the debt financing pursuant to
the Commitment Letter or otherwise shall be referred to herein as the "
_Financing_ "), and (ii) any fee letter associated with the Commitment Letter
(the " _Fee Letter_ ") (it being understood that any such fee letter has been
redacted as required by the

  

  

  

 

42  

  

  

counterparties thereto and to omit fee amounts and the terms of the "market
flex" items in a customary manner). As of the date of this Agreement, the
Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is the legal, valid, binding
and enforceable obligation of Parent, and, to the knowledge of Parent, each of
the other parties thereto, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency (including all Laws related to fraudulent transfers),
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and subject to the effect of general principles of equity. The
Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified on or prior to the date of
this Agreement and as of the date of this Agreement, no such amendment or
modification is contemplated by Parent (except as described in the Fee
Letter), and as of the date of this Agreement, the respective commitments
contained in the Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, terminated or
rescinded in any respect. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has
occurred or circumstance exists which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the
part of Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any of the other parties
thereto, under the Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent
has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing
contemplated in the Commitment Letter will not be satisfied or that the
Financing will not be made available to Parent on the Closing Date. As of the
date of this Agreement, there are no side letters or other contracts directly
related to the Financing to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
other than the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter and any related customary
engagement letters and confidentiality agreements. As of the date of this
Agreement, Parent has fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, any and all
commitment or other fees which are due and payable on or prior to the date of
this Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letter and the Fee
Letter.

  


 

  

(g) _Investigation by Parent._ Parent has conducted its own independent review
and analysis of the businesses, assets, condition, operations and prospects of
the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses. Parent
acknowledges that, except for the representations and warranties of the
Company expressly set forth in Section 3.01, none of the Company nor any of
its Representatives makes any representation or warranty, either express or
implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the information provided
or made available to Parent or any of its Representatives. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, except for the representations and warranties
made by the Company in Section 3.01, none of the Company nor any of its
Representatives or any other person has made a representation or warranty to
Parent with respect to (i) any projections, estimates or budgets of future
results or future financial

  

  

 

43  

  

  

condition relating to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses or (ii) any material, documents or information relating to the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses made available to
Parent or its Representatives in any "data room" or otherwise.

SECTION 4.02. _No Solicitation._ (a) The Company (i) shall not, and shall

Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate, any Takeover
Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that would reasonably
be expected to result in or lead to a Takeover Proposal or (B) enter into,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any person (or any Representative thereof) any

  

  

  

 

48  

  

  

information with respect to or in connection with, or otherwise knowingly
cooperate with any person (or any Representative thereof) with respect to, any
Takeover Proposal or any inquiries or proposals that would reasonably be
expected to result in or lead to a Takeover Proposal, (ii) shall and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing activities,
discussions and negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Takeover Proposal or any inquiries or proposals that would reasonably
be expected to result in or lead to a Takeover Proposal and (iii) shall
promptly, and in any event within two days following the date of this
Agreement, request, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to

confidential information previously furnished to any person within 24 months
prior to the date of this Agreement for the purposes of evaluating a possible
Takeover Proposal to the extent that the Company is entitled to have such
documents returned or destroyed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to release any person from or waive
any standstill provision or similar provision with respect to any capital
stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any agreement to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party solely to the extent that (x)
such provision would otherwise prohibit the counterparty thereto from making a
confidential Takeover Proposal directly to the Board of Directors of the
Company in accordance with this Section 4.02 and (y) the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law. Except to the
extent otherwise permitted by the foregoing sentence, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enforce the standstill provisions of any such
agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.02 to the contrary, at
any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona
fide written unsolicited Takeover Proposal received after the execution of
this Agreement which did not result from a material breach of this Section
4.02, (x) the Company and its Representatives may contact the person proposing
such Takeover Proposal or the Representatives of such person solely to clarify
the terms and conditions thereof and (y) if the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and Citigroup or another financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company under applicable Law, the Company may, and may permit and
authorize its Subsidiaries and its Representatives and its Subsidiaries'
Representatives to, in each case subject to compliance with Section 4.02(c)
and the other provisions of this Agreement, (1) furnish information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person making such Takeover
Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
which contains terms that are no less restrictive of

  

  

  

 

49  

  

  

such person than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (an "
_Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ that all such
information had been provided, or is concurrently provided, to Parent, and (2)
participate in discussions or negotiations with, and only with, the person
making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such
Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is
understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section
4.02(a) by any Subsidiary of the Company or any Representative of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section
4.02(a) by the Company.

  


 

  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any
proposal or offer from any person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act) (other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) providing
for, in one transaction or a series of transactions, any (I) merger,
consolidation, binding share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company or
(II) direct or indirect acquisition, including by way of any merger,
consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset
acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, license agreement or similar
transaction, of (A) assets or businesses that constitute or represent 20% or
more of the total revenue, net income, EBITDA (earnings before interest
expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization) or assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) 20% or more of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock or of any class of capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, one or more of the Subsidiaries of the Company
which, in the aggregate, directly or indirectly hold the assets or businesses
referred to in clause (A) above.

  


 

  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any
binding bona fide unsolicited written offer which did not result from a
material breach of this Section 4.02(a) made by any person (other than Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries) that, if consummated, would result in such person
(or, in the case of a direct merger between such person and the Company, the
stockholders of such person) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50%
of the Company Common Stock or the outstanding voting power of the Company or
all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, and which offer, in the good faith determination of the Board of
Directors of the Company (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and Citigroup or another financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation), (1) is more favorable from a financial point of view to the
stockholders of the Company than the consideration payable in the Merger
(taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or otherwise)) and

  

  

 

50  

  

  

(2) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all
financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

  


 

  

(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (or shall agree or resolve to) (i) (A) withhold, withdraw, modify or
qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, or propose publicly to withhold,
withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the
recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or
any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger or (B) recommend, declare
advisable or propose to recommend or declare advisable the approval or
adoption of any Takeover Proposal or resolve or agree to take any such action,
or adopt or approve any Takeover Proposal (any action in this clause (i) being
referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) cause or permit
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar agreement (each, an " _Acquisition
Agreement_ ") constituting or related to, or which is intended to or would
reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time prior to the
Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may (x) other than
in connection with a Takeover Proposal, effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change under clause (A) of the definition thereof, or (y) in response to a
Superior Proposal, effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f) to accept such Superior Proposal, in the
case of each of clauses (x) and (y), only if the Board of Directors of the
Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and Citigroup or another financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, and after giving effect to all of the adjustments to
the terms of this Agreement that have been offered in writing by Parent in
accordance with this Section 4.02(b), that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Board of Directors of the Company
may not effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f) unless (1) the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have first provided written notice to Parent (an " _Adverse
Change Notice_ ") at least three business days prior to such action that it is
prepared to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, and, if such
action is in response to a Superior Proposal, attaching the most current
version of any written agreement relating to the transaction that constitutes
such Superior Proposal (including any financing thereof, to the extent such
financing agreements are available) and (2) upon the end of such notice
period, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have (aa) considered in
good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by
Parent by the end of

  

  

  

 

51  

  

  

such notice period and (bb) determined in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and Citigroup or another financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, that (I) in the case of a Superior Proposal,
the offer previously constituting a Superior Proposal continues to constitute
a Superior Proposal and (II) the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment or modification to the financial terms or conditions or other
material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Adverse Change
Notice and a new notice period under clause (1) of this proviso shall commence
(except that the three business day period referred to in clause (1) of this
proviso shall instead be a two business day period)). The Company agrees that,
during the three or two business day period prior to its effecting an Adverse
Recommendation Change or termination pursuant to Section 7.01(f), the Company
and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives (to the extent Parent desires and is willing to do so)
regarding any revisions to the terms of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent.

  


 

  

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable
and in any event within 24 hours after the receipt thereof, advise Parent
orally and in writing of (i) any Takeover Proposal or any request for
information or inquiry that the Company reasonably believes could lead to or
contemplates a Takeover Proposal and (ii) the material terms and conditions of
such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry (including any subsequent amendment
or other modification to such terms and conditions and, if applicable, copies
of any written requests, inquiries, proposals or offers, including proposed
agreements) and the identity of the person making any such Takeover Proposal,
request or inquiry. Commencing upon the provision of any notice referred to
above, the Company (or its outside counsel) shall keep Parent (or its outside
counsel) informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status, including any
change to the material terms and conditions, of such Takeover Proposal,
request or inquiry, and the status of any discussions or negotiations with
respect thereto.

  


 

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or complying with Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if,
in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, failure so to disclose would be
inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the

  

  

  

 

52  

  

  

foregoing shall in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any such
position or disclosure would otherwise have under this Agreement.

  _Additional Agreements_

  


 

  

SECTION 5.01. _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting._ (a)
Subject to Parent's compliance with its obligations contained in the next
sentence, as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare and, no later than the 15th calendar day (or, if such
calendar day is not a business day, on the first business day subsequent to
such calendar day) immediately following the date of this Agreement, file with
the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement. Parent shall furnish all information
concerning Parent and Sub to the Company as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy
Statement and shall otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Company in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of any SEC comments
related thereto. The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as practicable
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or
for additional information and shall provide (i) copies of all written
correspondence or (ii) a summary of all oral communications, in each case
between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other
hand, to Parent as promptly as practicable. The Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments
of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and to cause the Proxy
Statement in definitive form to be mailed to the Company's stockholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable after, but in any event not more than one
business day after, the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to
the Company's stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto (including any oral
response to comments), the Company (x) shall provide Parent and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response
(including any proposed oral response to comments), (y) shall include in such
document or response all comments reasonably proposed by Parent and (z) shall
not file or mail such document, or respond to the SEC, prior to receiving the
approval of Parent or its counsel, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If, at any time prior to the Stockholders
Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement shall

  

  

 

53  

  

  

not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC as promptly as
practicable and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company.

  


 

  

(b) The Company agrees that the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and that none of
the information included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement
will, at the date the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to the
stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, or at
the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no
covenant is made by the Company with respect to statements made in the Proxy
Statement based on information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent
specifically for inclusion or incorporation for reference therein. Parent
agrees that none of such information will, at the date the Proxy Statement is
filed with the SEC or mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time
of the Stockholders Meeting, or at the time of any amendment or supplement
thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Proxy Statement mailed to the holders of Company Common
Stock shall include the notice of appraisal rights required to be delivered by
the Company pursuant to Section 262 that complies with applicable Law.

  


 

  

(c) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of
this Agreement, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the sole purpose of
obtaining the Stockholder Approval and voting on a proposal to adjourn the
Stockholders Meeting (and, if applicable, the advisory vote required by Rule
14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection therewith), which meeting the
Company shall, absent any Legal Restraint that has the effect of preventing
such action, cause to occur no later than the 35th calendar day (or, if such
calendar day is not a business day, on the first business day subsequent to
such calendar day) immediately following the date that the mailing of the
Proxy Statement has been substantially completed (the " _Stockholders Meeting_
"); _provided_ that the Stockholders Meeting shall be held no earlier than the
50th calendar day after the date of this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_
, that the Company, after consultation with

  

  

 

54  

  

  

Parent, may postpone or adjourn, or make one or more successive postponements
or adjournments of, the Stockholders Meeting if the Company reasonably
believes that (i)(A) the Company is unable to obtain a quorum of its
stockholders at such time or (B) the Company will not receive proxies
sufficient to obtain Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present,
(ii) it is necessary to postpone or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting to ensure
that any required amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement is mailed to
holders of Company Common Stock within a reasonable amount of time in advance
of the Stockholders Meeting or (iii) such postponement or adjournment is
required by Law or a court or other Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction in connection with any actions in connection with this Agreement,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or has
been requested by the SEC or its staff, so long as, in the case of any
postponement or adjournment under clause (i) of this Section 5.01(c), the
Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned more than an aggregate of
30 calendar days without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event that during
the three business days prior to the date that the Stockholders Meeting is
then scheduled to be held, the Company delivers a notice of an intent to make
an Adverse Recommendation Change, Parent may direct the Company to postpone
the Stockholders Meeting for up to five business days and, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws,
the Company shall promptly, and in any event no later than the next business
day, postpone the Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Parent's direction,
subject to the Company's right to postpone the Stockholders Meeting for a
longer period pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. The notice of
the Stockholders Meeting shall state that a proposal to adopt this Agreement
will be considered at the Stockholders Meeting. Subject to Section 4.02(b),
(x) the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend to holders of
Company Common Stock that they adopt this Agreement and shall include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (y) the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit the Stockholder Approval. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations
pursuant to this Section 5.01(c) shall not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or any
other person of any Takeover Proposal or, other than with respect to the
immediately preceding sentence of this Section 5.01(c), the making of any
Adverse Recommendation Change. The Company shall provide updates to Parent
with respect to the proxy solicitation for the Stockholders Meeting (including
interim results) as reasonably requested by Parent.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ (a) The Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to Parent's
Representatives reasonable access upon reasonable advance notice and during

  

  

 

55  

  

  

normal business hours (under supervision of appropriate personnel and in a
manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries) during the period prior to the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all their respective
properties, assets, books, records, Contracts, Permits, documents,
information, directors, officers and employees, and during such period the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish as
promptly as reasonably practicable to Parent any information concerning its
business as Parent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding sentence, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to afford access or furnish information to the extent (i) relating to
the minutes of the Company's Board of Directors or any committees thereof
(including any presentations or other materials prepared by or for the
Company's Board of Directors or any committee thereof) where the Company's
Board of Directors or any such committee thereof discussed this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any similar
transaction with any other person, including any Takeover Proposal, (ii) the
Company determines in good faith that affording such access or furnishing such
information would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries ( _provided_ that the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to allow for such access or to furnish such information in a
manner that does not jeopardize the attorney-client privilege), (iii) that
affording such access or furnishing such information would violate applicable
Law or result in significant antitrust risk for the Company or its
Subsidiaries or (iv) such request involves conducting subsurface, invasive or
environmental sampling or testing, including with respect to building
materials and indoor air quality. No investigation by Parent or any of its
Representatives and no receipt of information by Parent or any of its
Representatives shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision of this
Agreement, or the obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect
thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement. Except as required by any applicable Law, Parent will hold, and
will direct its Representatives to hold, any and all information received from
the Company confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) Subject to applicable Law, the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause
each of their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate to ensure an orderly
transition and integration process in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in order to minimize the
disruption to, and preserve the value of, the business of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries.

  

  

 

56  

  

  

(c) Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each
of the parties hereto, Parent, as the sole stockholder of Sub, will adopt this
Agreement.

  


 

  

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries shall cooperate, and shall cause its affiliates and
Representatives to reasonably cooperate, with Parent in all Tax matters,
including by maintaining and making available to Parent and its affiliates all
books and records relating to Taxes.

  


 

  

(e) Parent and the Company shall take the actions set forth in Section 5.02(e)
of the Company Letter.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.03. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Consultation and Notice._ (a) Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using its reasonable best efforts to accomplish the
following: (i) the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in
Article VI, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions and
Consents from, and the giving of any necessary notices to, Governmental
Entities and other persons and the making of all necessary registrations,
declarations and filings (including filings under the HSR Act (which each of
the parties hereto shall file, or cause to be filed, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, but not later than fifteen business days
after the date hereof, such date to be determined by Parent in consultation
with the Company) and other registrations, declarations and filings with, or
notices to, Governmental Entities, that may be required under the HSR Act or
other applicable antitrust, competition or pre-merger notification or trade
regulation Laws of any jurisdiction (collectively, " _Review Laws_ "), if
any), (iii) the taking of all reasonable steps to provide any supplemental
information requested by any Governmental Entity, including participating in
meetings with officials of such entity in the course of its review of this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (iv) the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any
Proceeding by any Governmental Entity or third party. In connection with and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and its
Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all actions
necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions

  

  

  

 

57  

  

  

contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or its
Subsidiaries (including Sub and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries) be required to agree to or accept (A) any
prohibition of or limitation on its or their ownership, or any limitation that
would affect its or their operation, of any portion of their respective
businesses or assets, including after giving effect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) divest, hold separate
or otherwise dispose of any portion of its or their respective businesses or
assets, including after giving effect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (C) any limitation on the ability of Parent or
its Subsidiaries to acquire or hold or exercise full rights of ownership of
any capital stock of the Company or its Subsidiaries, including after giving
effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (D) any other limitation on its or their ability to, or the
manner in which they, operate, conduct or control their respective businesses
or operations, including after giving effect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any such action or limitation
described in clauses (A) through (D), a " _Restriction_ "), other than
Permitted Restrictions, which Permitted Restrictions Parent or its
Subsidiaries shall be required to agree if and only to the extent ultimately
necessary to obtain pre-merger clearance from the U.S. and E.U. antitrust and
competition law authorities (specifically, for (1) any waiting period
applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act to have been terminated or expired
and (2) the European Commission to have issued a decision finding the Merger
to be compatible with the common market under the Council Regulation, or to
have been deemed to have done so pursuant to Article 10(6) of the Council
Regulation), provided that in the aggregate any such Permitted Restrictions
would not have or reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the business, assets, properties, financial condition or results of operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Permitted Restrictions_ " shall mean (x)
Restrictions of the type described in clause (B) or (C) of the definition
thereof solely involving the businesses or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries which, in the aggregate, generated no more than $450,000,000 of
the consolidated revenues of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2016 (any such Restrictions described in this clause
(x), " _Required Divestitures_ ") and (y) Restrictions of the type described
in clause (A) or (D) of the definition thereof which are applied solely
against and solely involve and impact the operations, businesses and assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, when combined with the impact of any Required Divestitures, have or
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business,
assets, properties, financial condition or results of operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or, after the Effective Time,
the Surviving

  

  

  

 

58  

  

  

Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parent is not required to agree to or accept any Restriction that
involves, applies to or impacts the operations, businesses or assets of Parent
or any of its affiliates other than Permitted Restrictions with respect to the
Surviving Corporation and Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation. In no
event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be permitted to commit or
agree to any Restriction without Parent's prior written consent. Nothing in
this Section 5.03(a) shall require any party to take or agree to take any
action with respect to its business or operations pursuant to this Section
5.03(a) unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned
upon the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
be obligated to litigate or participate in the litigation of any Proceeding
brought by or against any Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining any
Consent from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent shall determine
the strategy to be pursued for obtaining and lead the effort to obtain all
necessary actions or nonactions and Consents from Governmental Entities in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Company shall take all reasonable actions to support Parent
in connection therewith. Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) reasonably
cooperate with each other in connection with any filing or submission with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and any Consents from any Governmental Entity
in connection therewith and any investigation or other inquiry related thereto
and in connection with resolving any such investigation or inquiry with
respect to any such filing or the Merger, (ii) not extend any waiting or
suspension period under any applicable Review Laws or enter into any agreement
with any Governmental Entity not to consummate the Merger, including any
timing agreements or agreements to pull and re-file their HSR filing, except
with the prior written consent of the other party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (iii) respond as promptly as
practicable to any applicable inquiries or requests received from any
Governmental Entity for additional information or documentation, (iv) promptly
make any applicable further filings or information submissions pursuant
thereto that may be necessary or advisable and (v) promptly make any requisite
filings or submissions required under any applicable Review Laws. Each of
Parent and the Company shall (A) promptly notify the other party of any
written or oral communication to that party or its Subsidiaries or
Representatives from any Governmental Entity regarding the parties'
collaborative efforts to obtain the Consents, (B) subject to applicable Law
and to the extent reasonably practicable, permit the other party to review and
comment on any written communication regarding such efforts prior

  

  

 

59  

  

  

to providing such communication to any Governmental Entity and (C) to the
extent reasonably practicable, not agree to participate, or permit its
Subsidiaries or Representatives or, in the case of the Company, the Controlled
Affiliate, to participate, in any substantive meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry
concerning Consents to the Merger unless it consults with the other party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity and
reasonably practicable, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate. Without limiting the foregoing, neither party shall make any
filings, submissions or written communications to any Governmental Entity to
obtain the Consents without first providing a written copy of such filing,
submission or communication to the other party (or as appropriate to such
party's outside counsel) and allowing the other party a reasonable opportunity
to provide comments on such filing, submission or communication prior to
submission. Parent and the Company covenant and agree to incorporate all
reasonable comments of the other party (or as appropriate such party's outside
counsel) with respect to such filings, submissions and communications prior to
delivery of the same to any Governmental Entity.

  


 

  

(c) (i) In connection with the continuing operation of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, subject to applicable Law, the Company shall consult in good
faith on a reasonably regular basis with Parent to report material,
individually or in the aggregate, operational developments, the general status
of relationships with material customers, suppliers and resellers, the general
status of ongoing operations and other matters reasonably requested by Parent
pursuant to procedures reasonably requested by Parent and in a manner
consistent with (A) any organizational or personal conflict of interest
mitigation plans, including firewalls, entered into by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject
and (B) applicable confidentiality obligations, including the Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such consultation shall operate as
a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement
or other provision in this Agreement, or the obligations of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement.

  

  

(ii) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, the Company shall promptly notify
Parent in writing of:

  


 

  

(A) (1) any representation or warranty made by Company contained in Section
3.01 becoming untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in
Section 6.02(a) would not be satisfied, (2) the failure of the Company to
perform in any material respect any

  

  

 

60  

  

  

obligation to be performed by it under this Agreement such that the condition
set forth in Section 6.02(b) would not be satisfied or (3) the occurrence of
any change, development, event, effect, condition, occurrence, action or
omission that would reasonably be expected to result in the condition set
forth in Section 6.02(d) not being satisfied;

  


 

  

(B) any written notice or other communication from any person (other than a
Governmental Entity) alleging that notice to or Consent of such person is
required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement if the subject matter of such communication or the failure
of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries to obtain such Consent would be
material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent;

  


 

  

(C) any material written notice or other material communication from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and a copy of any such notice or communication
shall be furnished to Parent, together with the Company's written notice;

  


 

  

(D) any material written notice or other material communication from any
customer, distributor, supplier or reseller to the effect that such customer,
distributor, supplier or reseller is terminating or otherwise adversely
modifying its relationship with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
result of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and

  


 

  

(E) any Proceedings commenced or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,
or any circumstance that would reasonably be expected to lead to any
Proceeding, against or involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that,
if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have
been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.01(h) or that relate to the consummation
of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall operate as a waiver
or otherwise affect any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other
provision in this Agreement, or the obligations of the parties (or remedies
with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement; _provided_ _further_ , that the failure to deliver any
such notification,

  

  

 

61  

  

  

in and of itself, shall not result in the failure of, or otherwise affect, any
of the conditions set forth in Article VI.

  


 

  

(iii) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, Parent shall promptly notify the
Company in writing of:

  


 

  

(A) (1) any representation or warranty made by Parent or Sub contained in
Section 3.02 becoming untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth
in Section 6.03(a) would not be satisfied or (2) the failure of Parent or Sub
to perform in any material respect any obligation to be performed by such
party under this Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section
6.03(b) would not be satisfied;

  


 

  

(B) any written notice or other communication from any person (other than a
Governmental Entity) alleging that notice to or Consent of such person is
required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement if the subject matter of such communication or the failure
of the Parent or one of its Subsidiaries to obtain such Consent would be
material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent; and

  


 

  

(C) any Proceedings commenced or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened,
against or involving Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that relate to the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

  


 

  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the
parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement; _provided_ _further_ , that
the failure to deliver any such notification, in and of itself, shall not
result in the failure of, or otherwise affect, any of the conditions set forth
in Article VI.

  


 

  

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of any litigation against
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective directors
or officers relating to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and will obtain the prior written consent of Parent prior to
settling or satisfying any such claim, it being understood and agreed that
this Section 5.03(d) shall not give Parent the right to direct such defense.

  

  

 

62  

  

  

SECTION 5.04. _Company Equity-Based Awards._ (a) Effective as of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder
of a Company Stock Option, except as set forth in Section 5.04(f) below, each
then outstanding Company Stock Option (whether or not then vested and
exercisable) (i) shall automatically become fully vested and (ii) shall
terminate and be converted automatically into the right to receive a lump sum
cash payment equal to (A) the product of (1) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether or not then vested, and (2) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price applicable to such shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, less (B) any
applicable withholding for Taxes (the " _Option Merger Consideration_ "). For
the avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price applicable to shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than
the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall terminate and be
canceled in exchange for no consideration. As of the Effective Time, each
holder of Company Stock Options shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Option Merger Consideration related
to the applicable Company Stock Option, without interest, payable in
accordance with this Section 5.04.

  


 

  

(b) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of Company Restricted
Shares, except as set forth in Section 5.04(f) below, each then outstanding
Company Restricted Share (i) shall automatically become fully vested and all
restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse and (ii) shall terminate and be
converted automatically into the right to receive a lump sum cash payment
equal to (A) the Merger Consideration, less (B) any applicable withholding for
Taxes (the " _Restricted Share Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective
Time, each holder of Company Restricted Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Restricted Share Merger
Consideration for each Company Restricted Share, without interest, payable in
accordance with this Section 5.04.

  


 

  

(c) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of Company Performance
Shares, except as set forth in Section 5.04(f) below:

  


 

  

(i) in the event the Closing occurs prior to the date on which the Company
Performance Shares granted in 2015 (the " _2015 Company Performance Shares
"_), would vest in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, each then outstanding 2015 Company Performance Share (A) shall
automatically become vested based on deemed achievement of performance metrics
at the greater of target

  

  

 

63  

  

  

performance for all applicable metrics or actual performance for all
applicable metrics for the performance period (without pro-ration) and all
restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse and (B) shall terminate and be
converted automatically into the right to receive a lump sum cash payment
equal to (1) the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Performance Share immediately prior to the Effective
Time (determined after taking into account the vesting set forth in Section
5.04(c)(i)(A) and rounded up or down to the nearest share), and (y) the Merger
Consideration, less (2) any applicable withholding for Taxes (the " _2015
Performance Share Merger Consideration_ "); and

  


 

  

(ii) each then outstanding Company Performance Share that was granted in 2016
or 2017 (the " _Subsequent Period Company Performance Shares_ ") (A) shall
automatically become vested based on deemed achievement of performance metrics
at target performance for all applicable performance metrics with pro-ration
in accordance with the applicable Company Stock Plan and the award agreements
thereunder and (B) shall terminate and be converted automatically into the
right to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to (1) the product of (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Performance
Share immediately prior to the Effective Time (determined after taking into
account the vesting set forth above), and (y) the Merger Consideration, less
(2) any applicable withholding for Taxes (the " _Subsequent Period Performance
Share Merger Consideration_ " and together with the 2015 Performance Share
Merger Consideration, the " _Performance Share Merger Consideration_ "). With
respect to each Subsequent Period Company Performance Share that is forfeited
due to pro-ration, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective
Time, Parent shall grant each holder thereof who remains an employee as of the
grant date with an award of Parent restricted stock rights with respect to a
number of shares of Parent common stock with a value equal to two times the
value of such forfeited Company Performance Shares (for the avoidance of
doubt, calculated at target performance multiplied by the Merger
Consideration) (the " _Parent Retention Grant_ "). One-half of the Parent
Retention Grant shall vest on March 1, 2019 and the remaining one-half of the
Parent Retention Grant shall vest on March 1, 2020, in each case subject to
continued employment with Parent and its Subsidiaries as of such dates;
_provided_ , _however_ , that holders of Parent Retention Grants who are
involuntarily terminated other than for cause prior to March 1, 2019 shall
vest in half of the Parent Retention Grant upon such termination.

  

  

(iii) As of the Effective Time, each holder of Company Performance Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the

  

  

 

64  

  

  

Performance Share Merger Consideration for each Company Performance Share or
the Parent Retention Grant, if applicable, without interest, payable in
accordance with this Section 5.04.

  


 

  

(d) Effective as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of any holder of Company Deferred Stock Units, except
as set forth in Section 5.04(f) below, each then outstanding Company Deferred
Stock Unit (i) shall automatically become fully vested and (ii) shall be
converted automatically into the right to receive a cash payment equal to (A)
the product of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Deferred Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(2) the Merger Consideration, less (B) any applicable withholding for Taxes,
payable in accordance with, and subject to, the deferral elections applicable
to such Company Deferred Stock Units as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

  


 

  

(e) Effective as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of any holder of Company Phantom Stock Units, each then
outstanding Company Phantom Stock Unit (i) shall automatically become fully
vested and (ii) shall represent the right to receive a cash payment equal to
(A) the product of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Phantom Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(2) the Merger Consideration, less (B) any applicable withholding for Taxes,
payable in accordance with, and subject to, the deferral elections applicable
to such Company Phantom Stock Units as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

  


 

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary including the provisions of
Sections 5.04(a), (b), (c) and (d) of this Agreement or otherwise, with
respect to Permitted 2018 Awards (as defined and permitted by Section 4.01 of
the Company Letter), only the 2018 Award Pro Rata Percentage shall become
vested at the Effective Time and shall be entitled to the Option Merger
Consideration, the Restricted Share Merger Consideration, the Performance
Share Merger Consideration and the consideration set forth in Section 5.04(d).
The remainder of any Permitted 2018 Award shall be forfeited. The 2018 Award
Pro Rata Percentage means a fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the number
of days that have elapsed from the grant date of such award (or in the case of
Company Performance Shares, from the beginning of the performance period)
through and including the Closing Date and (ii) the denominator of which is
the total number of days from the grant date of such award (or in the case of
Company Performance Shares, from the beginning of the performance period)
through the final regularly scheduled vesting date of such award. For the
avoidance of doubt, any Permitted 2018 Awards that are Company Performance
Shares shall be cashed out at

  

  

  

 

65  

  

  

deemed target level performance with pro-ration in accordance with the terms
of the first sentence of Section 5.04(c)(ii).

  


 

  

(g) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no
event later than 10 days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, pay the amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 5.04, net of any applicable withholding
Taxes, through the Surviving Corporation's payroll or a third party engaged to
provide payroll services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any
Company Equity-Based Awards subject to Section 409A of the Code, including the
Company Deferred Stock Units and the Company Phantom Stock Units, the payments
required under this Section 5.04 shall be made in accordance with the deferral
elections applicable to such Company Equity-Based Awards as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time and otherwise in compliance with
Section 409A of the Code.

  


 

  

(h) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company
(or if appropriate, any committee administering the applicable Company Stock
Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be
reasonably necessary or desirable to (i) effectuate the treatment of the
Company Equity-Based Awards pursuant to this Section 5.04 and (ii) cause the
Company Stock Plans (other than the Company ESPP) to terminate at the
Effective Time.

  


 

  

(i) The Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee
administering the Company ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other actions as may be required to provide that with respect to the Company
ESPP: (i) participants in the Company ESPP (" _ESPP Participants_ ") may not
increase their payroll deductions under the Company ESPP from those in effect
on the date of this Agreement; (ii) no new ESPP Participants may commence
participation in the Company ESPP following the date of this Agreement; (iii)
all participation in and purchases under the Company ESPP shall be suspended
effective as of the last day of the offering period that includes the date of
this Agreement (the " _ESPP Suspension Date_ "), such that the offering period
in effect as of the date of this Agreement will be the final offering period
under the Company ESPP; and (iv) with respect to any offering period under the
Company ESPP in effect as of the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
ensure that such offering period ends at the ESPP Suspension Date and that
each ESPP Participant's accumulated contributions for such offering period are
applied to the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
the terms of the Company ESPP unless the ESPP Participant has previously
withdrawn from such offering period in accordance with the terms of the
Company ESPP. Any cash remaining in the Company ESPP after purchases

  

  

 

66  

  

  

occurring on the ESPP Suspension Date shall be refunded to ESPP Participants
promptly following the ESPP Suspension Date.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.05. _Employee Matters_. (a) For the 12 month period following the
Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who is an
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time (a " _Continuing Employee_ ") with (i) at least the same base
cash compensation or other base wages provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) target annual incentive
opportunities that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the
target annual cash incentive opportunity and target annual equity incentive
opportunity provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time (which, in the case of incentive opportunities granted
following the Closing, shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the
applicable employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries);
(iii) severance benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than
the severance benefits provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time (for the avoidance of doubt, after taking into account
the service crediting provisions of Section 5.05(b) and any additional service
performed following the Closing Date); and (iv) other compensation and
employee benefits (excluding, for this purpose, the compensation contemplated
by clauses (i)-(iii) above and retention, change in control, or one-time or
special benefits or arrangements) that are substantially comparable, in the
aggregate, to those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Nothing in this Section 5.05(a) is intended to or shall
create any right in any employee, consultant or contractor of the Company to
continued employment by or service to Parent, the Company, the Sub, or, in
each case, any affiliate or Subsidiary thereof, or limit the ability of
Parent, the Company, the Sub, or, in each case, any affiliate or Subsidiary
thereof, to terminate the employment or service of any employee, consultant or
contractor of the Company for any reason.

  


 

  

(b) To the extent that a Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate
in an employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than the Company or its Subsidiaries), Parent shall cause such employee
benefit plan to (i) recognize the service of such Continuing Employee with the
Company and its Subsidiaries (or their predecessor entities) for purposes of
eligibility, participation, vesting and, except under defined benefit pension
plans and plans providing for retiree medical or other welfare benefits,
benefit accrual under such employee benefit plan of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, to the same extent such service was recognized under a
comparable Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that such
recognition of service (A)

  

  

 

67  

  

  

shall not operate to duplicate any benefits of a Continuing Employee with
respect to the same period of service, and (B) shall not apply for purposes of
any plan, program or arrangement under which similarly-situated employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service; and (ii)
with respect to any health, dental, vision plan or other welfare plan of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) (any such plan, a " _Parent Welfare Plan_ ") in which any
Continuing Employee is eligible to participate for the plan year in which such
Continuing Employee is first eligible to participate, use commercially
reasonable efforts to (x) cause any pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions or eligibility waiting periods under such Parent Welfare Plan to be
waived with respect to such Continuing Employee to the extent such limitation,
exclusion or period would have been waived or satisfied under the Benefit Plan
in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (y) recognize and credit any health, dental or vision
expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee in the year that includes the
Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such Continuing Employee is
first eligible to participate) for purposes of any applicable deductible and
annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such health, dental or
vision plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of this Section 5.05, for the performance
year that includes the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the
applicable Subsidiary to, pay such annual cash incentive bonuses following the
Closing Date under the terms of the applicable Benefit Plan in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice.

  


 

  

(d) Without limiting the generality of this Section 5.05, from and after the
Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to, honor
in accordance with its terms any employment, change in control, or other
agreement set forth on Section 5.05(d) of the Company Letter.

  


 

  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, all terms and conditions of employment with
respect to any Continuing Employee who is subject to a collective bargaining
or similar labor agreement shall be made in accordance with the terms of such
agreement.

  


 

  

(f) This Section 5.05 shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section
5.05, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person
(including for the avoidance of doubt any current or former directors,
officers, employees, contractors or consultants of any of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section
5.05 or is

  

  

 

68  

  

  

intended to be, shall constitute or be construed as an amendment to or
modification of any employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or
arrangement of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
respective Subsidiary thereof. In addition, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall obligate Parent, the Company, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to (i) maintain any particular Benefit Plan or (ii) retain the
employment or services of any Company Personnel.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.06. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance._ (a) Parent and Sub
agree that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time now existing in favor of any person who is or prior to the
Effective Time becomes or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
provided in the respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any indemnification or other agreements of the Company or its applicable
Subsidiary, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall be
assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at
the Effective Time, and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms and shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any
right thereunder of any such indemnified party, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to comply with and honor the foregoing obligations.

  


 

  

(b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then,
and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.06.

  


 

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a six-year "tail"
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy effective for claims
asserted for a six-year period after the Effective Time covering each person
covered as of the Effective Time by the Company's directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time on terms that are no less favorable than those of such policy
of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement, which insurance
shall, prior to the Closing, be in effect and prepaid for such entire six-year
period; _provided_ that the Company shall not pay annual premiums for such
policy in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid by the Company for
its existing

  

  

 

69  

  

coverage (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If such insurance coverage cannot be
obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an aggregate premium in excess of
the Maximum Premium, the Company shall acquire the most advantageous policy
obtainable for an aggregate premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

  


 

  

(d) The rights of each indemnified party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such indemnified party may have
under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any other organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the DGCL or otherwise.
The provisions of this Section 5.06 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and are expressly intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the indemnified parties and shall be binding on
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and assigns.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.07. _Financing Cooperation._ (a) Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the
Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter,
including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
Commitment Letter until the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are consummated, (ii) timely negotiate definitive agreements
with respect to the facilities contemplated by the Commitment Letter on the
terms and conditions set forth therein (or on terms that will not materially
delay or prevent the Closing or make the funding with respect to the Financing
less likely to occur), (iii) satisfy or cause to be waived on a timely basis
all conditions applicable to Parent set forth in the Commitment Letter or such
definitive agreements that are within its control and otherwise comply with
its obligations thereunder and (iv) upon the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions, consummate the Financing; _provided_ , that nothing herein shall
prevent Parent from replacing all or any portion of the Financing provided for
in the Commitment Letter with one or more commitments from financial
institutions to provide an equal or greater amount of debt financing to be
made available on or prior to the Closing Date with conditionality no less
favorable to Parent in any material respect than that provided for in the
Commitment Letter, and upon any such replacement, the definition of
"Commitment Letter" set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been
modified as appropriate to reflect such replacement debt financing and any
related commitment letter.

  


 

  

(b) Parent shall not amend, modify or waive, or agree to amend, modify or
waive (in any case, whether by action or inaction), any term of the Commitment
Letter without the prior written consent of the Company if such amendment,
modification or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing
available on the Closing Date to

  

  

 

70  

  

  

pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (unless, in the case of this clause
(i), such amount is fully replaced with an amount of new financing with
conditionality no less favorable to Parent in any material respect), or (ii)
imposes new or additional conditions or amends or modifies any of the
conditions precedent to the receipt of the Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (x) materially delay or prevent the Closing, (y)
make the timely funding of the Financing or satisfaction of the conditions
precedent to obtaining the Financing less likely to occur or (z) adversely
impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against any other party to
the Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto in any
material respect ( _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, without the
consent of the Company, amend or modify the Commitment Letter or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto (A) in accordance with the "market
flex" provisions thereof and (B) to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or other titled roles with respect to financial
institutions that have not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of
this Agreement). Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the
status of the Financing and developments with respect thereto and shall, upon
the request of the Company, provide to the Company copies of all material
definitive documents related to the Financing (subject to customary redactions
of fee letters).

  


 

  

(c) If the Financing in an aggregate amount (together with cash and marketable
securities on hand) at least equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration to be
deposited with the Paying Agent and all other amounts required to be paid
pursuant to Article II, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by
the Commitment Letter, and such unavailable amount is reasonably required to
make the payment to the Paying Agent of the aggregate Merger Consideration,
all other amounts required to be paid pursuant to Article II, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such event, an "
_Original Financing Failure_ "), Parent shall promptly notify the Company in
writing of the Original Financing Failure and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as reasonably practicable,
alternative financing from alternative sources on terms and conditions not
materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent than those contained in
the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter and in an amount, when added with
cash and marketable securities of Parent and Sub, at least equal to the
Financing or such unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be (the "
_Alternate Financing_ "), and to obtain a new financing commitment letter with
respect to such Alternate Financing (the " _New Commitment Letter_ "), which
shall replace the existing Commitment Letter; _provided_ that any such
Alternate Financing shall not obligate the Company prior to the Closing as a
surety, guarantor or indemnitor or to extend credit to any person. Parent
shall promptly provide a true and complete copy of such New Commitment Letter
to the Company. In the event a New Commitment

  

  

 

71  

  

  

Letter is obtained, (i) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing"
shall mean the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as modified
pursuant to clause (ii) below, (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the
"Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to mean the New Commitment Letter and
(iii) any reference in this Agreement to

  

the "Fee Letter" shall be deemed to include any fee or other letter relating
to the New Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect.

  


 

  

(d) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (x) the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (y) the Closing, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to,
provide to Parent all cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the arrangement and consummation of the Financing or any
alternative financing arrangements entered into to provide funds for the
aggregate Merger Consideration, and all other amounts required to be paid
pursuant to Article II, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement ( _provided_ that such cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries),
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) participate in a reasonable
number of requested meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with the
parties acting as lead arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders,
underwriters and purchasers of, the Financing and the Company's senior
management and Representatives), presentations, road shows, due diligence
sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection
with the Financing, (ii) assist with the preparation of (A) materials for
rating agency presentations and investor presentations, (B) registration
statements, prospectuses, offering memoranda and private placement memoranda
(including use of reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents of
accountants for use of their reports in any of the foregoing), (C) bank
information memoranda (including a public-side version thereof) and (D)
similar documents, in each case required or customary in connection with the
Financing or otherwise reasonably requested by Parent, (iii) execute and
deliver (or use reasonable best efforts to obtain) customary certificates,
accountant's comfort letters (which shall provide "negative assurance"
comfort), consents, legal opinions, surveys and title insurance in each case
as reasonably requested by the Financing Sources, (iv) provide customary
authorization letters to the Financing Sources authorizing the distribution of
information to prospective lenders and containing a customary representation
that such information does not contain a material misstatement or omission and
containing a representation to the Financing Sources that the public side
versions of such documents, if any, do not include material non-public
information about the Company or its Subsidiaries or their securities, (v)
provide the lead arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders,
underwriters and purchasers of, the Financing with all documentation and other
information required with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection with applicable "know your

  

  

 

72  

  

  

customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA
PATRIOT ACT, Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 , (vi) assist Parent and its
Representatives with the preparation of the documents governing the Financing
(including any schedules, annexes or exhibits thereto and any pro forma
financial statements and financial projections required to be delivered
thereunder and such other pertinent and customary financial and other
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent shall
reasonably request in order to market, syndicate and consummate the
Financing), (vii) obtain customary payoff letters and any necessary lien
terminations and other instruments of discharge in connection with the
repayment of existing indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries
reasonably requested by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and (viii) cooperate
with Parent's Financing Sources' due diligence, to the extent customary or
reasonable; _provided_ , _however_ , all non-public or otherwise confidential
information regarding the Company obtained by Parent pursuant to this Section
5.07(d) shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, and the Company shall only be required to furnish such information
to any prospective lenders or other proposed Financing Sources, underwriters,
placement agents, initial purchasers or other third parties that have agreed
to keep such information confidential; and _provided_ _further_ that nothing
in this Agreement shall require any cooperation to the extent it would (1)
require the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Board of Directors of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or
agree to pay any commitment, financing or other fees or reimburse any expenses
prior to the Closing Date; (2) require any officer of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to execute or deliver any document or certificate in connection
with the Financing that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be
effective prior to the Closing (other than customary documents or certificates
solely relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, including the
authorization letter and representation referred to in Section 5.07(d)(iv));
(3) unreasonably or materially interfere with the ongoing business or
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (4) require the Company or its
Subsidiaries to take any action that would conflict with or violate any
applicable Laws or any provision of the organizational documents of the
Company, or that would result in a violation or breach of, or default under,
any Specified Contract in effect as of the date of any such request; or (5)
result in any officer or director of the Company or its Subsidiaries incurring
any personal liability in connection with the Financing. Subject to Parent's
indemnification obligations under this Section 5.07, the Company hereby
consents to the customary use of its and its Subsidiaries' trademarks, service
marks and logos in connection with the Financing; _provided_ that such logos
are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to
harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no obligation of the Company or
its Subsidiaries under any certificate, document or instrument shall be
effective until the

  

  

 

73  

  

  

Closing and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to take any
action under any certificate, document or instrument that is not contingent
upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing (other than,
in each case, customary documents or certificates solely relating to the
Company or its Subsidiaries including the authorization letter and management
representation referred to in Section 5.07(d)(iv)). Parent shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Company and its affiliates, and their respective
pre-Closing Representatives, from and against any liability, obligation or
loss suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing, any information provided in connection therewith (other than
arising from information provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries but
including any violation of the Confidentiality Agreement) and any misuse of
the logos or marks of the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection therewith,
except in the event such liabilities, obligations or losses arose out of or
result from the willful misconduct of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives. Parent shall promptly reimburse the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. Parent
acknowledges and agrees that obtaining the financing contemplated by this
Section 5.07, or any other financing, is not a condition to the Closing, and
affirms its obligations to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (subject to the conditions contained in Article
VI) irrespective and independently of the availability of any such financing.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.08. _Fees and Expenses._ (a) Except as expressly set forth in this
Section 5.08 and in Section 5.07, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the
Merger is consummated.

  


 

  

(b) In the event that (i) a Takeover Proposal has been publicly made (whether
or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to the Company or its
stockholders or any person has publicly announced an intention (whether or not
conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to make a Takeover Proposal or, in
the case of a termination by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(i), a Takeover

Company by the date that is 30 business days after receipt of written notice

recommendation of the adoption of this Agreement within five business days of
a

  

  

 

80  

  

  

written request by Parent for such reaffirmation following the Company's or
its Subsidiaries' or Representatives' receipt of a Takeover Proposal or any
material change thereto.

  


 

  

SECTION 7.02. _Effect of Termination._ In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.01, this

Representatives of the Financing Sources and such affiliates (such entities,

affiliates, the " _Financing Sources Related Parties_ ") in connection with
this Agreement or the Financing, whether at law or in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, and agrees that it will not commence any actions or
proceedings asserting any such rights or claims; _provided_ , that the
foregoing waiver and release shall not apply to any rights, claims or causes

Financing Sources or the Financing Sources Related Parties for breach of any
nondisclosure agreement that any Financing Sources Related Party may have
entered into with the Company or its affiliates.

  


 

  

SECTION 7.03. _Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto

been obtained, there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further
approval by stockholders of the Company without the further approval of such
stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Section 7.03, and Sections 7.02, 8.06(b), 8.09(b) and 8.10, of
which the Financing Sources and the Financing Sources Related Parties are
express third party beneficiaries, may not be amended, modified, supplemented
or waived in a manner adverse to them without the express written consent of

81  

  

  

warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or
(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein
(to the extent legally permissible); _provided_ , _however_ , that after the
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no waiver that by

further approval of such stockholders. Any agreement on the part of a party to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of such party which specifically sets forth the
terms of such extension or waiver. The failure or delay by any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall any single or partial
exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its rights under this
Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other
rights under this Agreement. 
 

  

  

ARTICLE VIII

SECTION 8.04. _Exhibits; Interpretation._ The headings contained in this
Agreement or in any Exhibit hereto and in the table of contents to this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in any Exhibit
but not otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning as defined in this
Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section
or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit
to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. For all purposes hereof, the
terms "include", "includes" and "including" shall be deemed followed by the
words "without limitation". The words "hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein"
and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to
the extent" means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and
such phrase does not mean simply "if". The word "foreign" means relating to a
jurisdiction other than the United States or any subdivision thereof, and
includes multinational and supranational political unions. Except as otherwise

delivered in person or electronically to Parent, Sub or their respective
Representatives as of such time. The definitions contained in this Agreement
are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms.
References to a person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. Each
of the parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this
Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by all of the parties,
and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions in this Agreement. All
references to a person shall include any predecessor entities of such person.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.05. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic image scan
transmission), all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall

  

  

 

88  

  

  

become effective when one or more such counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.06. _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement
(a) together with any Exhibit hereto and the Company Letter, constitutes the
entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
of this Agreement, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, and (b) except
for (i) Sections 7.02, 7.03, and 8.09(b) and 8.10, of which the Financing
Sources and the Financing Sources Related Parties are express third party
beneficiaries, and (ii) Section 5.06, is not intended to confer upon any
person other than the parties hereto (and their respective successors and
assigns) any rights (legal, equitable or otherwise) or remedies, whether as
third party beneficiaries or otherwise.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.07. _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of Laws thereof.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.08. _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that Parent and Sub may assign, in their
sole discretion, any of or all of their rights, interests and obligations
under this Agreement to any affiliate of Parent, but no such assignment shall
relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations under this Agreement if
such assignee does not perform such obligations. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.09. _Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Venue._ (a) Each
of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of
Chancery shall be unavailable, any Delaware State court and the Federal court
of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware) for the
purposes of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (and agrees that no such
Proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be brought by it or any of its
Subsidiaries except in such courts). Each of the parties further agrees that,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such person's
respective address set forth above shall be effective service of process for
any Proceeding in the State of Delaware with respect to any matters to which
it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth

  

  

 

89  

  

  

above in the immediately preceding sentence. Each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally waives (and agrees not to plead or claim), any
objection to the laying of venue of any Proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of
Chancery shall be unavailable, in any Delaware State court or the Federal
court of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware) or
that any such Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the
parties hereto agrees that it (i) will not bring or support any Proceeding,
cross-claim or third party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or
equity, whether in contract or tort or otherwise against the Financing Sources
or the Financing Sources Related Parties arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Financing, in any forum other than a court of competent jurisdiction located
within the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, New York, whether a
state or federal court, (ii) all claims or causes of action (whether at law,
in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Financing
Sources or the Financing Sources Related Parties in any way relating to this
Agreement, shall be exclusively governed by, and constructed in accordance
with, the internal laws of the State of New York, and (iii) the provisions of
Section 8.10 relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such
Proceedings.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.10. _Waiver of Jury Trial._ Each party hereto hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any Proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of,
under or in connection with this Agreement or the Financing. Each party hereto
(a) certifies that no Representative of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any
Proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement,
by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section
8.10.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.11. _Enforcement._ The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Court
of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, in
any Delaware State court or the Federal court of the United States

  

  

 

90  

   

  

of America sitting in the State of Delaware), this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.12. _Consents and Approvals._ For any matter under this Agreement
requiring the consent or approval of any party to be valid and binding on the
parties hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing and executed and
delivered to the other parties by a person duly authorized by such party to do
so.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.13. _Severability._ If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision hereof and the
invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not
invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.

  

  

 

91  

   

  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Sub and the Company have caused this Agreement to
be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized, all as of
