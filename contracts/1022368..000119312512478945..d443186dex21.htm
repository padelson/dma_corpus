state, local or foreign Tax Law. Except for payments to employees of the Company with respect to Company Restricted Shares, Option Payments or RSU Payments, before making any such deduction or withholding, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall give the Company notice of the intention to make such deduction or withholding, and such notice, which shall include the authority, basis and method of calculation for the proposed deduction or withholding, shall be given at least
a commercially reasonable period of time before such deduction or withholding is required, in order for the Company to obtain reduction of or relief from such deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i)&nbsp;shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii)&nbsp;shall be treated for all purposes of this

the DGCL, then the right of such holder to receive such payment in respect of such Dissenting Shares will cease and such Dissenting Shares will be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and will be exchangeable solely for the
