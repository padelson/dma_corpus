2 AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

 

THE OFFER

 

1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) On the date of commencement of the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act), Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub filed with the SEC a
Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together
with all amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto,
the " _Schedule TO_") that incorporated by reference the Offer to Purchase
and form of the related letter of transmittal, form of summary advertisement
and such other customary documents included therein (the Schedule TO, the
Offer to Purchase and such other documents pursuant to which the Offer is
being made, the " _Offer Documents_ "). 

(b) Subject to the conditions of this Agreement, as promptly as practicable
but in no event later than three Business Days after the date hereof, Merger
Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, amend the offer to purchase
(as so amended and supplemented, the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") and the other
Offer Documents, in each case in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
(as so amended and supplemented, the " _Amended Offer Documents_ "), including
to reflect the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ ")
and file with the SEC the Amended Offer Documents.

(c) Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to (i) increase the Offer Price,
(ii) waive any Offer Condition (provided, that Merger Sub will not waive the
Minimum Condition without the prior written consent of the Company) and (iii)
make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer not
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, in each case subject to
extending the Offer as required by applicable Law; provided, however, that
unless otherwise provided by this Agreement, without the prior written consent
of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (A) decrease the Offer Price, (B) change
the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (C) decrease the maximum
number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (D) add to, or impose
conditions to the Offer, other than the Offer Conditions, (E) amend or modify
any of the Offer Conditions or any of the terms of the Offer in a manner
adverse to the holders of Shares or that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or impair
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Offer, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby, (F) waive or change the Minimum
Condition (provided, that Merger Sub may, at its sole discretion prior to the
expiration of the Offer, waive or change the Minimum Condition to remove the
proviso in the definition of such term requiring that the calculation of the
total outstanding voting power of the Shares be made on a fully-diluted basis;
provided further, that Merger Sub (i) provides written notification of such
determination to the Company and (ii) provides any notification or
modification to the Amended Offer Documents with respect thereto, to the
extent required by applicable Law, in each case at least five Business Days
prior to

 



3  any scheduled Expiration Date) or (G) extend or otherwise change the
Expiration Date in a manner other than as required or permitted by this
Agreement. The Offer may not be withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (or
any Expiration Date, as extended pursuant to the terms of this Agreement),
unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article 8_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Offer Price
shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Shares), cash dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to the Shares, occurring on or after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, and such adjustment to the
Offer Price shall provide to the holders of Shares the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action; provided, that nothing
in this sentence shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action
with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

(d) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m.
(New York City time) on the date that is the later of (i) December 14, 2012 or
(ii) the date that is five (5) Business Days following the date of filing with
the SEC of the Amended Offer Documents (for this purpose calculated in
accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) (the " _Initial
Expiration Date_ ") or, in the event the Initial Expiration Date has been
extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, the date and time
to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such
later date and time to which the Initial Expiration Date has been extended
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, is referred to as the "
_Expiration Date_ ").

(e) The Offer shall be extended from time to time as follows:

(i) If on the scheduled Expiration Date, the Minimum Condition has not been
satisfied or any of the other Offer Conditions have not been satisfied (other
than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at any time prior the
Offer Acceptance Time), or waived by Parent or Merger Sub if permitted
hereunder, then prior to the then scheduled Expiration Date Merger Sub shall
extend the Offer for one or more periods of not more than five (5) Business
Days each (or such other number of Business Days as the parties may agree) and
ending no later than the Outside Date in order to permit the satisfaction of
such conditions (subject to the right of Merger Sub to waive any Offer
Condition, other than the Minimum Condition (except as provided in Section
1.1(c)), in accordance with this Agreement); _provided_ , that nothing in
this  _Section 1.1(e)(i)_ shall be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise
restrict in any manner the right of Parent or the Company to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Article 8_ hereof; and

 

(ii) Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer
for any period or periods required by applicable Law, interpretation or
position of the SEC or its staff or the New York Stock Exchange LLC (the "
_NYSE_ ") or its staff, in each case applicable to the Offer, provided that
Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date.

 



4 (f) Merger Sub may (and the Amended Offer Documents shall reserve the right of
Merger Sub to) provide for a subsequent offering period (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act) in compliance with Rule
14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act (a " _Subsequent Offering Period_ ")
of not fewer than three (3) Business Days nor more than twenty (20) Business
Days (for this purpose calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under
the Exchange Act) immediately following the expiration of the Offer; provided,
that Merger Sub shall offer a Subsequent Offering Period of three (3)
Business Days at the request of the Company if, immediately following the
expiration of the Offer, the Short Form Threshold has not been reached and
cannot be reached through the immediate exercise of the Top-Up Option
hereunder in accordance with its terms. Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
and Merger Sub shall, accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly
tendered during such Subsequent Offering Period as promptly as practicable
after any such Shares are tendered and in any event in compliance with Rule
14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act. Parent shall provide or cause to be provided
to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase and pay for
any and all Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment and
purchase pursuant to the Offer and shall cause Merger Sub to fulfill all of
Merger SubÂ’s covenants, agreements and obligations in respect of the Offer
and this Agreement, in each case to the extent such covenants and payment
obligations are to be performed or made at or prior to Closing. Parent and
Merger Sub shall, and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall ensure that all of
their respective Affiliates shall, tender any Shares held by them into the
Offer.

(g) Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article 8_. In the event that this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, (i) promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer, (ii) not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer and
(iii) cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to promptly return,
in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares to the registered
holders thereof.

 

(h) The Company shall cooperate fully in the preparation of the Amended Offer
Documents to reflect the terms of this Agreement and the Company and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Amended Offer
Documents before they are filed with the SEC. Parent and Merger Sub agree that
they shall cause the Amended Offer Documents and all exhibits, amendments
or supplements thereto filed by either Parent or Merger Sub with the SEC to
comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and other applicable Laws. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company will furnish to the Parent and
Merger Sub the information relating to it required by the Exchange Act to be
set forth in the Amended Offer Documents, including in connection with
communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of the Shares.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve
all SEC comments with respect to the Amended Offer Documents as promptly as
reasonably practicable 

 



5  after receipt thereof. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to
correct any information provided by it for use in the Amended Offer Documents
which shall have become false or misleading. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
shall as soon as reasonably practicable notify the Company of the receipt of
any comments from the SEC with respect to the Amended Offer Documents and any
request by the SEC for any amendment to the Amended Offer Documents or for
additional information and shall provide the Company with copies of all such
comments and correspondence. Prior to filing or mailing the Amended Offer
Documents (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to
any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, each
of Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to
review and to propose comments on such document or response and shall, in good
faith, consider and incorporate the reasonable comments of the Company.

1.2 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) No later than three (3) Business Days following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall file with the SEC, and shall promptly thereafter
disseminate to holders of Shares, as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities Laws, a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement
on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any exhibits, amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that shall reflect the Company Board
Recommendation. The Company agrees that it will cause the Schedule 14D-9 to
comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable
Laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and
Merger Sub will furnish to the Company the information relating to it required
by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC comments with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 as promptly as reasonably practicable after
receipt thereof. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to correct
any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 which shall have
become false or misleading. The Company shall as soon as reasonably
practicable notify Parent and Merger Sub of the receipt of any comments from
the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 and any request by the SEC for any
amendment to the Schedule 14D-9 or for additional information and shall
provide Parent with copies of all such comments and correspondence. Prior to
filing or mailing the Schedule 14D-9 (or any amendment or supplement thereto)
or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with
respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and to propose comments on such document or response and shall,
in good faith, consider and incorporate the reasonable comments of Parent.

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer agent
to promptly furnish Parent with a list of the CompanyÂ’s record stockholders,
mailing labels and any available listing or computer file containing the names
and addresses of all record holders of Shares, any non-objecting beneficial
owner lists and any available listings of securities positions of record
holders of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case, to the CompanyÂ’s
knowledge, true and correct as of the most recent practicable date, and shall
provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists of
stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such

 



6  other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with
communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares. Parent
and Merger Sub and their agents shall hold in confidence the information
contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information
only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall
be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver, and shall use their reasonable
efforts to cause their agents to deliver, to the Company (or destroy) all
copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then in their
possession or control or under the control of any of their representatives or
agents in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

1.3 _Directors_.

 

(a) Promptly upon the Offer Acceptance Time and all times thereafter, subject
to compliance with applicable Laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, Merger Sub shall be entitled to designate
such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company
Board as is equal to the product of (i) the total number of directors on the
Company Board (after giving effect to the directors designated by Merger Sub
pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (ii) the percentage that the
aggregate voting power of Shares at such time beneficially owned by Parent,
Merger Sub and any of their Affiliates bears to the total voting power of
Shares then issued and outstanding. As used in this Agreement, the terms
"beneficial ownership" (and its correlative terms) shall have the meaning
assigned to such term in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. The Company
shall, upon Merger SubÂ’s request at any time following the Offer Acceptance
Time, take all such actions necessary to (A) appoint to the Company Board the
individuals designated by Merger Sub and permitted to be so designated by the
first sentence of this _Section 1.3(a)_, including, but not limited to,
promptly filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the Company
Board, promptly increasing the size of the Company Board (including by
amending the bylaws of the Company if necessary so as to increase the size of
the Company Board) and/or promptly securing the resignations of such number of
its incumbent directors as are necessary or desirable to enable Merger SubÂ’s
designees to be so elected or designated to the Company Board, and (B) cause
Merger SubÂ’s designees to be so appointed at such time. The Company shall,
upon Merger SubÂ’s request following the Offer Acceptance Time, also cause
Persons elected or designated by Merger Sub to constitute the same percentage
(rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of each
committee of the Company Board to the extent permitted by applicable Laws and
the NYSE Listed Company Manual. The CompanyÂ’s obligations under this _Section
1.3(a)_ shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall take all actions required pursuant
to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section 1.3(a)_, including mailing to stockholders
the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
not later than such time as is necessary to enable Merger SubÂ’s designees to
be designated to the Company Board at the Offer Acceptance Time. Merger Sub
shall and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to supply the Company with, and be
solely responsible for, information with respect to Merger SubÂ’s designees
and ParentÂ’s and Merger SubÂ’s respective officers, directors and affiliates to
the extent required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1. The
provisions 

 



7  of this _Section 1.3(a)_ are in addition to and shall not limit any rights
that any of Merger Sub, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates may have
as a record holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of applicable
Laws with respect to the election of directors or otherwise.

(b) In the event that Merger SubÂ’s designees are designated to the Company
Board pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_, then, until the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause the Company Board to maintain three (3) directors who are
members of the Company Board on the date hereof and who are not officers,
directors or employees of Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their Affiliates, each
of whom shall be an "independent director" under Section 303A.00 of the NYSE
Listed Company Manual and eligible to serve on the CompanyÂ’s audit committee
under the Exchange Act and NYSE Listed Company Manual (the " _Continuing
Directors_ "), and at least one of whom shall be an "audit committee financial
expert" as defined in Items 407(d)(5)(ii) and (iii) of Regulation S-K;
provided, however, that if the number of Continuing Directors is reduced below
three for any reason, the Company shall take all necessary action (including
creating a committee of the Company Board) so that the remaining Continuing
Director(s) shall be entitled to elect or designate another Person (or
Persons) to fill such vacancy, and such Person (or Persons) shall be deemed to
be a Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement. If no Continuing
Director then remains, the other directors on the Company Board shall
designate three Persons who are not officers, directors or employees of
Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their affiliates, each of whom shall be
an "independent director" under Section 303A.00 of the NYSE Listed Company
Manual and eligible to serve on the CompanyÂ’s audit committee under the
Exchange Act and NYSE Listed Company Manual, and at least one of whom shall be
an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Items 407(d)(5)(ii) and
(iii) of Regulation S-K, to fill such vacancies and such Persons shall be
deemed Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Merger SubÂ’s
designees constitute a majority of the Company Board after the Offer
Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time, then the affirmative vote of
a majority of the Continuing Directors (or in the case where there are two or
fewer Continuing Directors, the concurrence of all Continuing Directors) shall
(in addition to the approval rights of the Company Board or the stockholders
of the Company as may be required by the Company Organizational Documents or
applicable Laws) be required (i) for the Company to amend, modify or terminate
this Agreement, (ii) for the Company to extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder, (iii)
to exercise or waive any of the CompanyÂ’s material rights, benefits or
remedies hereunder, (iv) for any amendment to the Company Organizational
Documents that adversely affects or would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the stockholders of the Company (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their Affiliates), or (v) to take any other action of the Company Board
under or in connection with this Agreement if such action would adversely
affect (in a non-de minimis manner), or would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect (in a non-de minimis manner), the holders of Shares (other
than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates); provided, however, such
affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall in no event
be required for the consummation of the Top-Up Option or the Merger in
accordance with this Agreement. The Continuing Directors shall have, and
Parent shall cause the Continuing 

 



8  Directors to have, the authority to retain such counsel (which may include
current counsel to the Company or the Company Board) in reasonable
circumstances and other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined
by the Continuing Directors, and the authority to institute any action on
behalf of the Company to enforce performance of this Agreement or any of the
CompanyÂ’s rights hereunder, in each case until the Closing. Following the
Offer Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time, unless required by
applicable Law or applicable fiduciary duties or for removal for good cause,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall take any action to remove any
Continuing Director.

1.4 _Top-Up Option_.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Parent and Merger Sub an option (the " _Top-
Up Option_ ") to purchase from the Company the number of Shares (such shares,
the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lesser of (i) the number of
Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent and its
Subsidiaries at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one
share more than 90% of the number of Shares that would be outstanding in each
class of Company Common Stock immediately after the issuance of all Shares
subject to the Top-Up Option on a fully diluted basis or (ii) the aggregate
number of Shares that the Company is authorized to issue under its articles
of incorporation, but that are not issued and outstanding (and are not
subscribed for or otherwise committed to be issued) at the time of exercise of
the Top-Up Option, at a price per share of Company Common Stock equal to the
Offer Price. The Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of
(A) the Effective Time and (B) the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms.

 

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Parent or Merger Sub once in whole
and not in part on or prior to the fifth Business Day after the later of the
Offer Acceptance Time and the expiration of any Subsequent Offering Period
pursuant to _Section 1.1(f)_, if applicable, if at such time, Parent, Merger
Sub or any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub do not own in the aggregate at
least 90% of the total then-outstanding shares of each class of Company Common
Stock (determined on a fully diluted basis); provided, however, that the
obligation of the Company to deliver the Top-Up Option Shares is subject to
the conditions that (i) no Order of any Governmental Entity shall restrain,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery
of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise; and (ii) Merger Sub
has accepted for payment and paid for all Shares validly tendered in the
Offer and not withdrawn.

(c) The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option Shares shall
be determined by multiplying the number of Top-Up Option Shares by the Offer
Price. Such purchase price may be paid by Parent or Merger Sub, at its
election, either (i) entirely in cash, (ii) by payment in cash of no less
than $0.01 per share and payment of the balance by executing and delivering to
the Company a promissory note (with full recourse to Parent) having a
principal amount equal to the difference between the purchase price and the
aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option Shares or (iii) any combination
thereof. Any such promissory note shall bear interest at the applicable
federal rate as determined for U.S. income tax purposes, shall mature on
the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such
promissory note and may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty.

 



9 (d) If they elect to exercise the Top-Up Option, Parent or Merger Sub shall
deliver to the Company a written notice setting forth (i) the number of
Shares that will be owned by Parent and Merger Sub immediately preceding the
purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares together with the number of Top-Up Option
Shares, (ii) the manner in which Parent or Merger Sub intends to pay the
applicable exercise price and (iii) the place and time at which the closing of
the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares is to take place, which shall take
place not later than five (5) Business Days following the Offer Acceptance
Time or the expiration of any Subsequent Offering Period pursuant to _Section
1.1(f)_. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such
notice (and in no event later than the Top-Up Option closing date), notify
Parent and Merger Sub in writing of the number of Shares then outstanding and
the number of Top-Up Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-
Up Option Shares, Parent or Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the
Company the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued
and delivered to Parent or Merger Sub (as the case may be) a certificate
or certificates representing the Top-Up Option Shares or, at ParentÂ’s or
Merger SubÂ’s request or otherwise if the Company does not then have
certificated Shares, the applicable number of non-certificated Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "). Such certificates or
Book-Entry Shares may include any legends required by applicable Laws. Without
the prior written consent of the Company, the right to exercise the Top-Up
Option granted pursuant to this Agreement shall not be assigned by Parent or
Merger Sub except in connection with an assignment in compliance with _Section
9.10_. Any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 1.4(d)_ shall
be null and void.

 

(e) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that
Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, and
will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "Accredited
Investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act.
Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be
acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, if any, are being and will be
acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to,
or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the
Securities Act.

 

ARTICLE 2

10  existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will continue as the

thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

(c) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will,
from and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and after the Effective
Time, will continue as the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until their respective successors have been duly
elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the

or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or
under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or
Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall
be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the
Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of
conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and
things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and
all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or
assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

2.2 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the
" _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on a date to be
specified by the 

 



11  parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), as promptly as practicable after the
satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in _Article 7_ but
in any event no later than the second Business Day thereafter (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), at
the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 885 Third Avenue, New York, New York,
unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto. On the Closing Date, or on such other date as Parent and the Company

filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the DGCL and will make all other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger will become effective at the

State of the State of Delaware or such other date and time as is agreed
upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger, such date and
time hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_."

ARTICLE 3

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

 

3.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting Shares, will be
converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, payable to the holder in
cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), upon surrender of the
certificate formerly representing such Shares in accordance with _Section
3.2_. At the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding,
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any of the Shares (other
than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_ and other
than Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, without interest.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that
are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any Company
Subsidiary, and all Shares owned of record by Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries, will be cancelled and will cease
to exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto.

 

(c) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and
become one newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and
such shares shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation. From and after the

 



12  Effective Time, all certificates representing Merger Sub Common Stock shall
be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance
with the preceding sentence.

3.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_. 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will designate a
reputable bank or trust company, mutually agreeable to both Parent and the
Company, to act as the paying agent for purposes of effecting the payment of
the Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_
"). At or promptly after the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub will
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which holders of Shares will be entitled at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement, together with the aggregate Option Payments
and RSU Payments (except to the extent that Parent determines to make any such
Option Payments or RSU Payments to employees through the payroll of the
Surviving Corporation). Such funds will be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent, in its sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the
Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares. Earnings from such investments will
be the sole and exclusive property of Parent, and no part of such earnings
will accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a certificate or certificates that represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ")
or Book-Entry Shares, in each case, which Shares were converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this
Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which will specify that delivery will
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and will otherwise be
in such form and have such other provisions as Parent or the Paying Agent may
reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly
executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will be entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented
by such Certificates and for each Book-Entry Share. Any Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. All cash paid
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares will be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it will be a
condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed or will be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the
Person requesting such payment will have paid any transfer or similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or will
have established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes
either have been paid or are not payable. Any other transfer or similar Taxes

 



13  incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will be paid by the Person required to make such payment by applicable Law.
Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares will
only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate or
Book-Entry Share will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as
contemplated by this Agreement, without any interest accruing thereon.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed and thereafter
there will be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will
cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, then
(subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of  _Section 3.2(b)_)
they will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any time
following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
funds (including any interest accrued with respect thereto) made available to
the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, and thereafter such holders will be entitled to look only to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the
Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in _Section 3.2(b)_, without
interest. If, prior to six years after the Effective Time (or otherwise
immediately prior to such time on which any payment in respect hereof would
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), any holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares has not complied with the procedures in
_Section 3.2(b)_ to receive payment of the Merger Consideration to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled, the payment in respect of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Paying Agent will be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to  _Section 3.1(a)_ hereof; provided,
however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may

 



14  reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect
to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law.
Except for payments to employees of the Company with respect to Company
Restricted Shares, Option Payments or RSU Payments, before making any such
deduction or withholding, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
shall give the Company notice of the intention to make such deduction or
withholding, and such notice, which shall include the authority, basis and
method of calculation for the proposed deduction or withholding, shall be
given at least a commercially reasonable period of time before such deduction
or withholding is required, in order for the Company to obtain reduction of or
relief from such deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

3.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for
such Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and will
instead represent the right to receive only the payment provided by Section
262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives,
withdraws or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then
the right of such holder to receive such payment in respect of such Dissenting
Shares will cease and such Dissenting Shares will be deemed to have been
converted, as of the Effective Time, into and will be exchangeable solely for
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest. The Company
will give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent will have
the right to participate in all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to
such demands. The Company will not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to
settle or compromise, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. If any appraisal is made of
Dissenting Shares and the Top-Up Option was exercised prior to the Effective
Time, then the cash received and/or value of the promissory note received by
the Company in payment of the exercise price of the Top-Up Option shall
be treated as if it were not paid to or received by the Company and the Top-
Up Shares issued upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option shall be treated as if
they were not issued or outstanding in connection with the determination of
the fair value of the Dissenting Shares in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL.

 



15 3.4 _Treatment of Company Options, Company RSUs and Restricted Shares; Stock
Plans_. 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) will adopt resolutions and
take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each unexpired and unexercised option to purchase
Shares (the " _Company Options_ "), under any stock option plan of the
Company, including the 1997 Equity Participation Plan or the 2004 Incentive
Award Plan, or any other plan, agreement or arrangement (the " _Company Stock
Option Plans_ "), whether or not then exercisable or vested, will be
cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled
Company Option will only be entitled to receive, in consideration of the
cancellation of such Company Option and in full settlement therefor, a payment
in cash of an amount equal to the product of (A) the total number of Shares
previously subject to such Company Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share previously subject to
such Company Option (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the
" _Option Payments_ "). From and after the Effective Time, any such cancelled
Company Option will no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but
will only entitle such holder to the payment of the Option Payment.

(b) _Treatment of Company RSUs_. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the
Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) will adopt
resolutions and take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide
that, immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, but conditioned upon the
consummation of the Offer, each outstanding restricted stock unit awarded
pursuant to any Company Stock Option Plan (the " _Company RSUs_ "), will vest
and become free of any restrictions and the Company will as promptly as
practicable thereafter deliver with respect to such Company RSU (i) shares of
Company Common Stock (such that such shares may be tendered in the Offer) and
(ii) the amount of any declared but unpaid dividends to the holder thereof in
settlement of each such Company RSU. At the Effective Time, each share of
Company Common Stock issued in respect of the Company RSUs (that has not
otherwise been tendered in the Offer or in any Subsequent Offering Period)
will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_ (such amounts payable under this _Section
3.4(b)_ being referred to as the " _RSU Payments_ "). To the extent any such
canceled Company RSU is subject to a deferred payment schedule pursuant to

additional payment by reason of any Tax imposed under Section 409A or Section
4999 of the Code. Each Company Benefit Plan that constitutes a nonqualified

set forth in _Section 4.12(j)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and has
been maintained and operated in material good faith documentary and
operational compliance with Section 409A or the Code or an available exemption

4.17 _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) _General_. _Section 4.17(a)(i)_- _(iv)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth with respect to the Intellectual Property Rights
registered or applied for in the name of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(" _Registered Intellectual Property,_ " and together with other Intellectual
Property Rights owned or purported to be owned by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, the " _Owned Intellectual Property_ "): (i) for each patent and
patent application, the patent number or application serial number for each
jurisdiction in which the patent or application has been filed, the
respective jurisdiction where filed, the date filed or issued, and the present
status thereof; (ii) for each trademark, tradename or service mark that is
registered, for which a pending application for registration has been filed,
the application serial number or registration number, the jurisdiction where
filed, the date filed or granted, and the class of goods covered, in each
case, if applicable; (iii) for any URL or Internet domain name, the
registration date, any renewal date and name of the Internet domain name
registrar; and (iv) for each copyrighted work for which a registration has
been filed, the registration number, date of registration and the jurisdiction
in which the copyright has been filed. All Intellectual Property Rights
issued or registered to the Company or any Company Subsidiary are subsisting,
and to knowledge of the Company, valid and enforceable. _Section 4.17(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all material licenses granted to the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to Intellectual Property Rights
applicable to the Company Products and the Business (" _Licensed Intellectual
Property_ "), other than standard, unmodified, off-the-shelf Software
commercially available on standard terms from third-party vendors (e.g.,
Microsoft Windows).

 



32 (b) _Sufficiency_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries own or have valid
and sufficient rights to all Intellectual Property Rights and to use
Technology that claim or cover the Company Products, or that are incorporated
in or necessary for the design, manufacture, use, distribution or sale of the
Company Products as currently marketed (collectively referred to herein as
the " _Material Intellectual Property_ "). To the knowledge of the Company,
the Material Intellectual Property (other than standard, unmodified, off-the-
shelf Software commercially available on standard terms from third-party
vendors (e.g., Microsoft Windows)) constitutes all Intellectual Property
Rights and Technology necessary for the conduct of the Business as presently
conducted, including for the design, manufacture, use, distribution and sale
of the Company Products. Nothing in this subsection (b) shall be deemed a
representation or warranty of non-infringement of third party Intellectual
Property Rights.

 

(c) _Ownership_. The Company or each Company Subsidiary exclusively owns the
Owned Intellectual Property, free and clear of Liens (other than Permitted
Liens). The Company and each Company SubsidiaryÂ’s rights in and to the Owned
Intellectual Property will not be impaired or cease to be valid and
enforceable, and no license to Licensed Intellectual Property will
terminate or expire, or be modified adversely to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, in each case by reason of the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. To the knowledge of the Company, neither the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the Offer,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, will trigger or
create any license under or Lien on any Intellectual Property Rights owned or
held by Parent or any of its affiliates under the terms of any Contract to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party. All of the CompanyÂ’s
and each Company SubsidiaryÂ’s current and former employees, officers,
contractors and consultants have executed valid and enforceable Intellectual
Property Rights assignment and confidentiality agreements for the benefit of
the Company and such Company Subsidiary.

 

(d) _Absence of Claims; Non-infringement_. To the knowledge of the Company,
neither the conduct of the Business nor the design, manufacture, use,
distribution or sale of the Company Products by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates the Intellectual
Property Rights of any other Person. No Proceedings have been instituted in
the last three years or are pending, or to the knowledge of the Company are
threatened against, the Company or any Company Subsidiary, that challenge the
CompanyÂ’s or any Company SubsidiaryÂ’s ownership of Owned Intellectual Property
or right to use the Licensed Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of the
Company, no interference, opposition, reissue, reexamination, or other similar
proceeding is or has been pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened, in which the scope, validity, or enforceability of any of the
Owned Intellectual Property is being or has been, contested or challenged.
Since May 31, 2009, the Company has not received any written notice alleging
the invalidity or unenforceability of the Owned Intellectual Property
(excluding, for clarity, all correspondence with patent authorities with
respect to ordinary course patent prosecution activities), or any
misappropriation of any other PersonÂ’s Trade Secrets by the research,
development, manufacture, use, distribution or sale of any Company Product.
Since

 



33  May 31, 2009, no Person has notified the Company that it is claiming any
ownership of or right to use any Owned Intellectual Property. The Owned
Intellectual Property is not subject to any outstanding Order of an
arbitrator or court or other Governmental Entity affecting adversely the
rights of the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect thereto
(excluding communications and decisions made in the ordinary course of
patent prosecution). To the knowledge of the Company, no Person has infringed
upon, misappropriated or otherwise violated any rights in or to any of the
Material Intellectual Property, or is currently doing so.

 

(e) _Licenses to Third Parties_. _Section 4.17(e)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule lists all Contracts pursuant to which any Person has been granted
any license under, or otherwise has received or acquired any right to use
(whether or not currently exercisable), the Owned Intellectual Property.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is bound by, and no Owned
Intellectual Property is subject to, any Contract containing any covenant or
other provision that in any way limits or restricts the ability of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary to use, exploit, assert, or enforce any of the
Owned Intellectual Property anywhere in the world.

(f) _Protection of Intellectual Property Rights_. All of the
registrations and pending applications with or to governmental or regulatory
bodies with respect to the Owned Intellectual Property have been timely and
duly filed, and prosecution of such applications has been diligently
conducted, except in each case as the Company or a Company Subsidiary has
elected in its reasonable business judgment to abandon or permit to lapse a
registration or application, and as has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company and each Company Subsidiary has taken reasonable
steps (including, entering into written confidentiality and nondisclosure
agreements with officers, directors, subcontractors, employees, licensees and
customers in connection with its assets or the Business) to safeguard and
maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of Trade Secrets that are material to
the Business.

(g) _Software_. The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries maintain and
use reasonable efforts to enforce policies and procedures regarding data
security, privacy, data transfer and the use of data that enable the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries to comply with all applicable Laws, except where
the failure to maintain and be in compliance with such policies would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries has
used commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the introduction into any
Software owned by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, or into any
computer system or network owned or controlled by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, and to the knowledge of the Company, such Software, systems and
networks do not contain, any "back door," "drop dead device," "time
bomb," "Trojan horse," "virus," or "worm" (as such terms are commonly
understood in the software industry) or any other code designed or intended to
have any of the following functions: disrupting or disabling, the
operation of, or providing unauthorized access to, a computer system or
network or other device on which such code is stored or installed. To the
knowledge of the Company, since May 31, 2010, no

 



34  Person has gained unauthorized access to any of the computer systems,
networks or data used by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that
would compromise to any material degree the value or confidentiality of such
computer systems, networks or data or that would necessitate that the Company
or any Company Subsidiary notify a third Person of such unauthorized access.

 

4.18 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Tax Returns_. The Company and each Company Subsidiary have timely filed
(taking into account any extension of time within which to file) all material
Tax Returns required to have been filed by or with respect to the Company or
any Company Subsidiaries, and all such Tax Returns are true, complete and
accurate in all material respects. No claim has been made in the past three
years in writing by a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where the Company
or any Company Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is or may be subject to material Taxes in such
jurisdiction.

(b) _Payment of Taxes_. All material Taxes of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary due and payable (whether or not shown or required to be shown on

been established in accordance with GAAP.

(c) _Audits, Investigations or Claims_. No deficiencies for any amount of
material Taxes have been proposed or assessed in writing against any of the

currently ongoing Tax audit or other proceeding with respect to material Taxes
and (ii) has waived any statute of limitations in respect of any Taxes or
agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or
deficiency, which waiver or extension is currently in effect.

(d) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has any liability under any agreement for the sharing, indemnification or
allocation of Taxes (other than customary provisions for Taxes contained in
credit, lease or other commercial agreements the primary purposes of which do
not relate to Taxes).

(e) _Other Entity Liability_. None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
has any liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than Taxes of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries) under Treasury regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or
any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), or as a transferee or
successor, by Contract or otherwise (excluding customary Tax indemnification
provisions in ordinary course commercial Contracts not primarily relating to
Taxes, such as gross-up obligations in financing agreements or Tax escalation
provisions in leases).

 

(f) _Withholding_. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has
withheld and, to the extent required by Law, paid to the appropriate
Governmental Entity all material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid
in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent
contractor, creditor, stockholder or other third party.

(h) _Listed Transactions_. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
entered into any " _listed transaction_ " within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

The Company has made available to Parent accurate and complete copies of all
material insurance policies and all material self-insurance programs and
arrangements relating to the business, assets and operations of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries (the " _Insurance Policies_ "). Each of the
Insurance Policies is in full force and effect, all premiums due and payable
thereon have been paid and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in
compliance in all material respects with the terms and conditions of such
Insurance Policies. Since May 31, 2010, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has received any written notice regarding any invalidation or
cancellation of any Insurance Policy that has not been renewed in the ordinary
course without any lapse in coverage.

4.20 _Properties and Assets_. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
(i) the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, as the case may be, have valid
and subsisting ownership interests in all of the material tangible personal
property reflected in the May 31, 2012 audited consolidated balance sheet
included in the Company SEC Reports prior to the date hereof as being owned
by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries or acquired after the date thereof
(except tangible personal properties sold or otherwise disposed of since the
date thereof in the ordinary course of business), free and clear of all
Liens, other than Permitted Liens and (ii) the tangible personal property

respects, subject to reasonable wear and tear.

4.22 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Company Board has received the
opinion (the " _Fairness Opinion_ ") of Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc. ("
_Houlihan_ ") to the effect that, based upon and subject to the assumptions,
qualifications and other matters set forth therein, as of the date of such
opinion, the Offer Price to be received in the Offer and the Merger
Consideration to be received in the Merger by the holders of Class A Common
Stock is fair to such stockholders from a financial point of view.

4.23 _Required Vote_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations set forth
in _Section 5.6(a)_, the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders
of Shares representing a majority of the voting power of the outstanding
shares of the Company Common Stock entitled to vote thereon (the " _Required
Vote_ ") is the only vote required of the holders of any class of capital
stock of the Company to adopt this Agreement (the " _Company Stockholder

any of the foregoing, except for employment or compensation agreements or
arrangements with directors and officers of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries.

6.4 _Stockholder Written Consent; Preparing of Information Statement_.

 

(a) Immediately after the execution of this Agreement and in lieu of calling a
meeting of the CompanyÂ’s stockholders, the Company shall submit the form of
Stockholder Written Consent attached hereto as Exhibit C (the " _Stockholder
Written Consent_ ") to those of the CompanyÂ’s stockholders listed on Exhibit
D. If the Stockholder Written Consent is duly executed by the CompanyÂ’s
stockholders by the Required Vote and is delivered to the Company in
accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL, then, as promptly as practicable
thereafter, the Company shall deliver to Parent a copy (including by
facsimile or other electronic image scan transmission) of the Stockholder
Written Consent, certified as correct and complete by an executive officer of
the Company.

(b) If the Stockholder Written Consent is not executed by the stockholders of
the Company by the Required Vote, or a copy (including by facsimile or other
electronic image scan transmission) thereof is not delivered by the Company
to Parent pursuant to _Section 6.4(a)_, in each case within 24 hours after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the parties hereto, Parent
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in _Section
8.1(c)_.

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the due execution and delivery
of the Stockholder Written Consent by the CompanyÂ’s stockholders by the
Required Vote, but in any event not later than the fifth Business Day
following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with
the SEC an information statement of the type contemplated by Rule 14cÂ–2 under
the Exchange Act related to the Merger and this Agreement (such information
statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the " _Information
Statement_ "). The Information Statement shall also contain (i) the notice of
action by written consent required by Section 228(e) of the DGCL and (ii) the
notice of availability of appraisal rights and related disclosure required by
Section 262 of the DGCL. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will cooperate
with each other in the preparation of the Information Statement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub will
furnish to the Company the information relating to it required by the
Exchange Act to be set forth in the Information Statement. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC comments with respect to
the Information Statement as promptly as reasonably 

 



49  practicable after receipt thereof and to have the Information Statement
cleared by the staff of the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after
such filing. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to correct any
information provided by it for use in the Information Statement which shall
have become false or misleading. The Company shall as soon as reasonably
practicable notify Parent and Merger Sub of the receipt of any comments from
the SEC with respect to the Information Statement and any request by the SEC
for any amendment to the Information Statement or for additional information
and shall provide Parent with copies of all such comments and
correspondence. Prior to filing or mailing the Information Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC (or
the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or
response and shall, in good faith, consider and incorporate the reasonable
comments of Parent. Promptly after the Information Statement has been cleared
by the SEC or after 10 calendar days have passed since the date of filing of
the preliminary Information Statement with the SEC without notice from the SEC
of its intent to review the Information Statement, the Company shall promptly
file with the SEC the Information Statement in definitive form as
contemplated by Rule 14cÂ–2 promulgated under the Exchange Act substantially in
the form previously cleared or filed with the SEC, as the case may be, and
mail a copy of the Information Statement to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders
of record in accordance with Sections 228 and 262 of the DGCL.

6.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_. 

(a) The Company and Parent will use their reasonable best efforts to (i) take,
or cause to be taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable, (ii) obtain, or cause their affiliates to obtain,
from any Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers,
approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained by Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or to avoid any action or
proceeding by any Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, those in
connection with the HSR Act), in connection with the authorization, execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein, including without limitation the Offer and the Merger
and (iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within three
Business Days after the date hereof, make, or cause their affiliates to make,
all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions,
and pay any fees due in connection therewith, with respect to this Agreement,
the Offer and the Merger required under (A) the Exchange Act, and any other
applicable federal or state securities Laws, (B) the HSR Act and (C) any
other applicable Law; provided, that the Company and Parent will cooperate
with each other in connection with (x) preparing and filing the Information
Statement, (y) determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing
with, any Governmental Entity is required, in connection with the consummation
of the Offer and the Merger and (z) seeking any such actions, consents,
approvals or waivers or making any such filings. The Company and Parent will
furnish, and cause their affiliates to furnish, to each other all information
required for any application or other filing under the rules and regulations
of any applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



50 (b) The Company and Parent will give (or will cause their respective
affiliates to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their
respective affiliates to use, their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any third-party consents, (i) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including delivering prepayment
notices to lenders under the CompanyÂ’s senior credit agreement provided such
notices are conditioned upon occurrence of the Offer Acceptance Time) or (ii)
required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, as applicable.

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
6.5_, each party hereto will, and will cause their affiliates to: (i) give the
other parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request,
inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding by or before any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the other parties
informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or legal proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the other parties of any
communication to or from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of
Justice or any other Governmental Entity regarding the Merger. Each party
hereto will consult and cooperate, and will cause its affiliates to consult
and cooperate, with the other parties and will consider in good faith the
views of the other parties in connection with any filing, analysis,
appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal
made or submitted in connection with the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding, each party
hereto will permit, and will cause its affiliates to permit, authorized
Representatives of the other parties to be present at each meeting or
conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal
proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any
document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in
connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal
proceeding.

(d) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will, and will cause its
affiliates to, (i) cooperate and coordinate with each other in the making of
any filings or submissions that are required to be made under any applicable
Competition Laws or requested to be made by any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) supply
each other or each otherÂ’s outside counsel with any information that may be
required or requested by any Governmental Entity in connection with such
filings or submissions, (iii) supply any additional information that may be
required or requested by the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of
Justice or other Governmental Entities in which any such filings or
submissions are made under any applicable Competition Laws as promptly
as practicable, and (iv) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under any
applicable Competition Laws as soon as reasonably practicable. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent will not, and will not
permit any

 



51  of its Subsidiaries to, enter into or publicly announce an agreement to form
a joint venture, strategic alliance or strategic partnership or to acquire any
assets, business or company if such agreement, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions set
forth in _Article 7_ not to be satisfied or would reasonably be expected to
have the effect of preventing, materially impairing, materially delaying or
otherwise materially and adversely affecting the consummation of the Merger.

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.5_ will require, or be construed to
require, Parent or any of its affiliates to proffer to, or agree to, sell,
divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold
separate, before or after the Effective Time, any of the assets, licenses,
operations, rights, products or businesses held by any of them prior to the
Effective Time, or any interest therein, or to agree to any material change
(including through a licensing arrangement) or restriction on, or other
impairment of ParentÂ’s or any of its affiliatesÂ’ ability to own, manage or
operate, any such assets, licenses, operations, rights, products or
businesses, or any interest therein, or ParentÂ’s ability to vote, transfer,
receive dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with respect to
the stock of the Surviving Corporation (any of the actions referred to in this
_Section 6.5(e)_, a " _Non-Required Remedy_ ").

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing
contained in this Agreement will give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the Company prior
to the Offer Acceptance Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its operations.

6.6 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until
the Effective Time, each party hereto will promptly notify the other party
hereto of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would be
likely to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied or (b) the failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
pursuant to this Agreement which would reasonably be expected to result in
any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this  _Section
6.6_ will not cure any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

 

6.7 _Public Announcements_. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree that the
initial joint press release and other announcements concerning the execution
and delivery of this Agreement will be substantially in the form provided to
each other prior to the date hereof (with such changes as the parties may
mutually agree). Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees that no
subsequent public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby will be issued by any party without the prior written
consent of the Company and Parent (which consent will 

 



52  not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or
announcement may be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of
any applicable United States securities exchange or regulatory or
governmental body to which the relevant party or its affiliates is subject, in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement will use its
reasonable best efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment
on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

6.8 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of twelve months following the Effective Time, Parent will
provide, or will cause to be provided, to those employees of the Company who
continue to be employed by Parent and Parent Subsidiaries (individually, "
_Company Employee_ " and collectively, " _Company Employees_ ") annual base
salary or base wages and short-term target cash incentive compensation
opportunities that are no less favorable than the annual base salary or base
wages and short-term target cash incentive compensation opportunities provided
to such Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. After the
Effective Time, Parent will provide pension, health and welfare benefits to
Company Employees who work more than 20 hours per week that are at least as
favorable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated Parent
employees; provided, that Parent may elect to continue Company Employees who
work more than 20 hours per week in their existing Company Benefit Plans for a
transition period.

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and levels of benefits
(but not benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan or frozen benefit plan
of Parent or vesting under any equity incentive plan) under the 401(k) plan,
severance pay plan, vacation plan, short term disability plan, active employee
medical, dental, vision and prescription drug plan, active employee life
insurance plan and service award of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries in
which Company Employees first become eligible to participate after the
Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall use reasonable best efforts
to credit each Company Employee with his or her years of service with the
Company before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee
was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated or
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided
that the foregoing will not apply for purposes of qualifying for subsidized
early retirement benefits, retiree medical benefits or life benefits, or to
the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits
with respect to the same period of service. In addition, Parent will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) each Company Employee to be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents,
to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable
Company Benefit Plans in which such Company Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



53 (c) For the terms of the agreements or arrangements, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, will, and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor, in accordance with their terms, the
employment, severance and change of control agreements and arrangements that
are listed on _Section 6.8(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(d) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, prior
to making any written or formal oral communications to Service Providers
pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each party will provide the other
party hereto with a copy of the intended communication, the other party
hereto shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the
communication, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing any
such mutually agreeable communication; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not apply to any individualized communications between Parent and a
Company Employee regarding such Company EmployeeÂ’s service after the Closing
or any individualized negotiations regarding offers of employment by Parent to
such Company Employee for post-Closing service. Between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to assist Parent in entering into ParentÂ’s standard documents relating
to compensation and benefits in respect of periods after the Effective Time
with each of the Company Employees.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement will require the continued employment of any
Person, and except as expressly set forth in this _Section 6.8_ and as set
forth on _Section 6.8_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no provision of
this Agreement will prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation from amending
or terminating any Company Benefit Plan or benefit plans of any Parent or
Parent Subsidiaries.

(f) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained
in this _Section 6.8_ with respect to employees are included for the sole
benefit of the respective parties and will not create any right in any other
Person, including any employees, former employees, any participant in any
Company Benefit Plan or any beneficiary thereof, nor will require the Company
to continue or amend any particular benefit plan after the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for any employee or former
employee of the Company, and any such plan may be amended or terminated in
accordance with its terms and Applicable Law.

 

6.9 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

(a) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation will indemnify and hold harmless all past and
present directors and officers of the Company to the same extent such Persons
are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
applicable Law, the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws and
indemnification agreements in existence on the date of this Agreement with
any directors and officers of the Company arising out of acts or omissions in
their capacity as directors or officers of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. Parent and the
Surviving 

 



54  Corporation will advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) incurred in the defense of any Proceedings with respect to the
matters subject to indemnification pursuant to this  _Section 6.9(a)_ in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the indemnification agreements in
existence on the date of this Agreement.

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent will
cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation and
indemnification of directors and officers of the Company for periods at or
prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company
Certificate. Parent will cause the indemnification agreements in existence on
the date of this Agreement with any of the directors, officers or employees of
the Company to continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms following the Effective Time.

 

(c) For six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain for the benefit of the CompanyÂ’s directors
and officers, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time,
an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is
substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the
aggregate than the CompanyÂ’s existing policy (accurate and complete copies
which have been previously provided to Parent) or, if
substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation will not
be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 250%
of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement. The
provisions of the immediately preceding sentence will be deemed to have been
satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time,
which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an
aggregate period of six years with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including, without
limitation, in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time,
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such policies in full
force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. If the
Company elects to purchase such prepaid policies prior to the Effective Time,
the Company (i) will not purchase policies with claims limits in excess of the
CompanyÂ’s current policies or expend in connection therewith an amount in
excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this
Agreement, and (ii) will consult and reasonably coordinate with Parent in
connection with such purchase.

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and will not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provision will be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, will assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_.

(e) The obligations under this _Section 6.9_ will (i) continue,
notwithstanding any six year limitation referred to above, until the final
disposition of

 



55  any action, suit, proceeding or investigation brought or commenced during
such six year period and (ii) not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this _Section 6.9_ applies
without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed
that the indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.9_ applies will be third party
beneficiaries of this  _Section 6.9_).

6.10 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition," "fair price,"
"business combination" or other anti-takeover Laws becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, Offer or the Merger, including
the acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto, the Support Agreements or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company Board will
take all action necessary to render such Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

6.11 _Parent Agreement Concerning Merger Sub_. Parent agrees to cause Merger
Sub to comply with its obligations under this Agreement.

 

6.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or
an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, will adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered Person
of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act (" _Section
16_") of Shares (including Company Restricted Shares), Company RSUs or Company
Options pursuant to this Agreement, and the Merger will be an exempt
transaction for purposes of Section 16\.

 

6.13 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. The Company and Parent will
cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the
delisting of the shares of Company Common Stock from the NYSE and the
deregistration of such shares as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time in compliance with applicable Law.

 

6.14 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company will promptly provide Parent with
any pleadings and correspondence relating to any Proceedings involving the
Company or any of its officers or directors relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and will keep Parent reasonably informed
regarding the status of any such Proceedings. The Company will consult and
reasonably coordinate with Parent with respect to the defense or settlement of
any such Proceeding, and no such settlement will be agreed to without the
prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned).

6.15 _Domain Names_. Prior to the Closing, the Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Internet domain names set forth
on _Section 4.17(c)(16)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule to be assigned to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

6.16 _Short Form Merger_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, if Parent shall own by virtue of the Offer or otherwise at
least 90% of the outstanding shares of each class of Company Common Stock
(the " _Short Form_

 



56   _Threshold_ "), the parties hereto shall take all necessary and appropriate
action to cause the merger of Merger Sub and the Company to become effective
as soon as reasonably practicable after such acquisition without a
stockholdersÂ’ meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

6.17  _Guarantee of Guarantor_.

(a) Guarantor is executing this Agreement to guarantee the performance by each
of Parent and Merger Sub of its payment and performance obligations under
this Agreement. Guarantor hereby guarantees unconditionally Parent and Merger
SubÂ’s payment obligations in and performance under this Agreement. This
guarantee shall apply regardless of any amendments, variations, alterations,
waivers or extensions to this Agreement whether or not Guarantor received
notice of the same and Guarantor waives all need for notice of the same. This
guarantee shall expire and be of no further force and effect as of 60 days
following the Effective Time.

(b) Guarantor is a corporation, duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of England and Wales and has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own, lease and operate their respective properties and
assets and to carry on their respective businesses as they are now being
conducted. Guarantor indirectly owns all of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of Parent.

(c) Guarantor has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Guarantor and the performance of Guarantor of its obligations
hereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Guarantor and no stockholder votes
are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Guarantor, and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery
by the Company, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of
Guarantor, enforceable against Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except
that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency
or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditorsÂ’ rights
generally and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and
other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to
the discretion of the court before which any Proceeding therefor may be
brought.

71 9.12 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_.

 

(a) This Agreement will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to laws that may be applicable

for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (the " _Chancery Court_ "), or, if the

AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,

and any Shares issuable upon the exercise of any Company Option held by a

there shall be a statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order or injunction
enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated or which is deemed applicable pursuant
to an authoritative interpretation by or on behalf of a Governmental Entity to

not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate with all other such failures to be true or correct, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

_Stockholders_

Section 1.1. _Annual Meetings_. An annual meeting of stockholders shall be
held for the election of directors at such date, time and place either within
or without the State of Delaware as may be designated by the Board of
Directors from time to time. Any other proper business may be transacted
at the annual meeting.

Section 1.2. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of stockholders may be
called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, if any, the Vice Chairman of
the Board, if any, the CEO, the President, the Secretary, the Board of
Directors, or the holders of record of not less than a majority of outstanding
shares of stock entitled to vote on a matter at the meeting, to be held at
such date, time and place either within or without the State of Delaware as
may be stated in the notice of the meeting. A special meeting of stockholders
shall be called by the Secretary upon the written request, stating the
purpose of the meeting, of stockholders who together own of record a majority
of the outstanding shares of each class of stock entitled to vote at such
meeting.

Section 1.3. _Notice of Meetings_. Whenever stockholders are required or
permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting
shall be given which shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting,
and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the
meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by law, the written notice of any
meeting shall be given not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the
date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United
States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at
such stockholderÂ’s address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.

Section 1.4. _Adjournments_. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special,
may be adjourned from time to time, to reconvene at the same or some other
place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time
and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business
which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment
is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date
is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. Section 1.5. _Quorum_. At each meeting of stockholders, except where
otherwise provided by law or the certificate of incorporation or these
bylaws, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled
to vote on a matter at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum. A quorum, once established, shall not be broken by
the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum. In the absence of
a quorum of the holders of any class of stock entitled to vote on a matter,
the holders of such class so present or represented may, by majority vote,
adjourn the meeting of such class from time to time in the manner provided by
Section 1.4 of these bylaws until a quorum of such class shall be so present
or represented.

 

Section 1.6. _Organization_. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over
by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in the absence of the Chairman of
the Board by the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or in the absence of the
Vice Chairman of the Board by the CEO, or in the absence of the CEO by the
President, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by a
chairman designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such
designation by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary, or in the
absence of the Secretary an Assistant Secretary, shall act as secretary of the
meeting, but in the absence of the Secretary and any Assistant Secretary the
chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the
meeting. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as
adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of the
stockholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules,
regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such
chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such
rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors
or prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation,
the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the
meeting; (ii) the determination of when the polls shall open and close for
any given matter to be voted on at the meeting; (iii) rules and procedures for
maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iv)
limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders
of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or
such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine; (v)
restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the
commencement thereof; and (vi) limitations on the time allocated to questions
or comments by participants.

Section 1.7. _Voting; Proxies_. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate
of incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of
stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by
such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question. Each
stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express
consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting
may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy,
but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its
date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy
shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as
long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in

 



2  law to support an irrevocable power, regardless of whether the interest with
which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the
Corporation generally. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not
irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an
instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy
bearing a later date with the Secretary of the Corporation. Voting
at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot and need not be
conducted by inspectors unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of all classes of stock entitled to vote thereon present in person or
represented by proxy at such meeting shall so determine. Directors shall be
elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of
directors. In all other matters, unless otherwise provided by law or by the
certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy
at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of
the stockholders.

Section 1.8. _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record_.

 

(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment
thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more
than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting. If no
record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the
day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A
determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for
the adjourned meeting.

 

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of
Directors is required by law, shall be the first date on which a signed
written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is
delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the
State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of
the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the CorporationÂ’s registered
office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and
prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, the record date
for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on
which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

 



3 (c) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record
date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record
date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty days prior
to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining
stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day
on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

Section 1.9. _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. The Secretary, or such
other officer of the Corporation who has charge of the stock ledger of the
Corporation, shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting
of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder,
for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least ten days
prior to the meeting, either (i) on a reasonable accessible electronic
network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list
is provided with the notice of meeting or (ii) during ordinary course business
hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. The list shall
also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the
whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.

 

Section 1.10. _Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting_. Unless otherwise
provided in the certificate of incorporation or by law, any action required
by law to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting
of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice
and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the
action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having
not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize
or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon
were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery
to (i) its registered office in the State of Delaware by hand or by certified
mail or registered mail, return receipt requested, (ii) its principal place
of business, or (iii) an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of
the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Every
written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who
signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the
corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty days of the earliest
dated consent delivered in the manner required by these bylaws, written
consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take action are delivered
to the Corporation by delivery to (i) its registered office in the State of
Delaware by hand or by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, (ii) its principal place of business, or (iii) an officer
or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of
meetings of stockholders are recorded. Any copy, facsimile or other reliable
reproduction of a

 



4  consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original
writing for any and all purposes for which the original writing could be used,
provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete
reproduction of the entire original writing. Prompt notice of the taking of
the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent
shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and
who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to
notice of the meeting if the record date for such meeting had been the date
that written consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take
the action were delivered to the Corporation as provided in this Section
1.10.

ARTICLE II __

 

 _Board of Directors_

Section 2.1. _Powers; Number; Qualifications_. The business and affairs of the
Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of
Directors, except as may be otherwise provided by law or in the certificate

removal. Any director may resign at any time from the Board of Directors or
any committee thereof upon notice given in writing or by electronic
transmission to the Board of Directors or to the CEO, the President or the
Secretary of the Corporation. Such resignation shall take effect at the time
specified therein or, if no time is specified, immediately, and unless
otherwise specified therein no acceptance of such resignation shall be
necessary to make it effective. Any director or the entire Board of Directors
may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the
shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors. Unless otherwise
provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, vacancies and
newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized
number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to
vote as a single class or from any other cause may be filled by a majority of
the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by the sole
remaining director. Any director elected or appointed to fill a vacancy shall
hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his
or her earlier resignation or removal.

Section 2.3. _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors
may be held at such places within or without the State of Delaware and at such

may be held at any time or place within or without the State of Delaware
whenever called by the Chairman of the Board, if any, by the Vice Chairman of
the Board, if any, by the 

 



5  CEO, by the President or by any two directors. Notice thereof stating the
place, date, and hour of the meeting shall be given to each director (or, in
the case of a committee, to each member of such committee) either by mail not
less than forty-eight (48) hours before the date of the meeting, by telephone
or electronic transmission on twenty-four (24) hoursÂ’ notice, or on such
shorter notice as the person or persons calling such meeting may deem
necessary or appropriate in the circumstances.

Section 2.5. _Participation in Meetings by Conference Telephone Permitted_.
Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these
bylaws, members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the
Board or subcommittee thereof, may participate in a meeting of the Board or
of such committee or subcommittee thereof, as the case may be, by means of
conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all
persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in
a meeting pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall constitute presence in person at
such meeting.

Section 2.6. _Quorum; Vote Required for Action_. At all meetings of the Board
of Directors a majority of the then appointed Board shall constitute a quorum
for the transaction of business. The vote of a majority of the directors
present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the
Board unless the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws shall require a
vote of a greater number. In case at any meeting of the Board a quorum shall
not be present, the members of the Board present may adjourn the meeting from
time to time until a quorum shall be present.

Section 2.7. _Organization_. Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be
presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in the absence of the

the CEO by the President, or in their absence by a chairman chosen at the
meeting. The Secretary, or in the absence of the Secretary an Assistant
Secretary, shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in the absence of the

any person to act as secretary of the meeting.

 

Section 2.8. _Action by Directors Without a Meeting_. Unless otherwise
restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, any action
required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or
of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the
Board or of such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or
by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic
transmissions or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of
the Board or committee.

 

Section 2.9. _Compensation of Directors_. No director serving on the Board of
Directors or any committee thereof will receive any compensation therefor
from the Corporation; provided that nothing herein shall be construed to
preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and
receiving compensation therefor.

 _Committees_

Section 3.1. _Committees_. The Board of Directors may designate one or more
committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the
Corporation. The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate
members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at
any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member
of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not
disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a
quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act at the
meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any
such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of
Directors or in these bylaws, shall have and may exercise all the powers and
authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and
affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to
be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall
have the power or authority in reference to the following matters: (i)
approving or adopting, or recommending to the stockholders, any action or
matter expressly required by law to be submitted to stockholders for approval,
(ii) adopting, amending or repealing these bylaws or (iii) removing or
indemnifying directors.

 

Section 3.2. _Committee Rules_. Unless the Board of Directors otherwise
provides, each committee designated by the Board may adopt, amend and repeal
rules for the conduct of its business. In the absence of a provision by the
Board or a provision in the rules of such committee to the contrary, a
majority of the entire authorized number of members of such committee
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, the vote of a
majority of the members present at a meeting at the time of such vote if a
quorum is then present shall be the act of such committee, and in other
respects each committee shall conduct its business in the same manner as the
Board conducts its business pursuant to Article II of these bylaws.

 

ARTICLE IV __

_Officers_

Section 4.1. _Officers; Election_. As soon as practicable after the annual
meeting of stockholders in each year, the Board of Directors shall elect a CEO
and a Secretary, and it may, if it so determines, elect from among its members
a Chairman of the Board and a Vice Chairman of the Board. The Board may also
elect a President, one or more Vice Presidents, one or more Assistant Vice
Presidents, one or more Assistant Secretaries, a Treasurer and one or more
Assistant Treasurers and such other officers as the Board may deem desirable
or appropriate and may give any of them such further designations or
alternate titles as it considers desirable. Any number of offices may be held
by the same person unless the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws
otherwise provide.

  



7 Section 4.2. _Term of Office; Resignation; Removal; Vacancies_. Unless
otherwise provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors electing any
officer, each officer shall hold office until his or her successor is elected
and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. Any officer
may resign at any time upon written notice to the Board or to the President
or the Secretary of the Corporation. Such resignation shall take effect at the
time specified therein, and unless otherwise specified therein no acceptance
of such resignation shall be necessary to make it effective. The Board may
remove any officer with or without cause at any time. Any such removal shall
be without prejudice to the contractual rights of such officer, if any, with
the Corporation, but the election of an officer shall not of itself create
contractual rights. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the Corporation by
death, resignation, removal or otherwise may be filled by the Board at any
regular or special meeting.

 

Section 4.3. _Powers and Duties_. The officers of the Corporation shall have
such powers and duties in the management of the Corporation as shall be
stated in these bylaws or in a resolution of the Board of Directors which is
not inconsistent with these bylaws and, to the extent not so stated, as
generally pertain to their respective offices, subject to the control of
the Board. The Secretary shall have the duty to record the proceedings of the
meetings of the stockholders, the Board of Directors and any committees in a
book to be kept for that purpose. The Board may require any officer, agent or
employee to give security for the faithful performance of his or her duties.

Section 4.4. _CEO_. The CEO shall, subject to the control of the Board of
Directors and, if there is one, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, have
general supervision of the business of the Corporation and shall see that all
orders and resolutions of the Board of Directors are carried into effect. The
CEO shall execute all bonds, mortgages, contracts and other instruments of the
Corporation requiring a seal, under the seal of the Corporation, except where
required or permitted by law to be otherwise signed and executed and except
that the other officers of the Corporation may sign and execute documents
when so authorized by these bylaws, the Board of Directors or the CEO. In the
absence or disability of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, or if there
is no Chairman of the Board of Directors, the CEO shall preside at all
meetings of the stockholders and, provided the CEO is also a director, at the
Board of Directors. The CEO shall also perform such other duties and may
exercise such other powers as may from time to time be assigned to such
officer by these bylaws or by the Board of Directors.

Section 4.5. _President_. At the request of the CEO or in the CEOÂ’s absence
or in the event of the CEOÂ’s inability or refusal to act (and if there is no
Chairman of the Board of Directors), the President shall perform the duties of
the CEO and, when so acting, shall have all the powers and be subject to all
the restrictions of the CEO. The President shall perform such other duties and
have such other powers as the Board of Directors from time to time may
prescribe. If there is no Chairman of the Board of Directors and no
President, the Board of Directors shall designate the officer of the
Corporation who, in the absence of the CEO or in the event of the inability or
refusal of the CEO to act, shall perform the duties of the CEO, and when so
acting, shall have all the powers of and be subject to all the restrictions
upon the CEO.

 



8 Section 4.6. _Secretary_. The Secretary shall attend all meetings of the Board
of Directors and all meetings of the stockholders and record all of the
proceedings thereat in a book or books to be kept for that purpose; the
Secretary shall also perform like duties for committees of the Board of
Directors when required. The Secretary shall give, or cause to be given,
notice of all meetings of the stockholders and special meetings of the Board
of Directors, and shall perform such other duties as may be prescribed by the
Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the CEO, to
whom the Secretary shall report. If the Secretary shall be unable or shall
refuse to cause to be given notice of all meetings of the stockholders and
special meetings of the Board of Directors, and if there is no
Assistant Secretary, than either the Board of Directors or the CEO may choose
another officer to cause such notice to be given. The Secretary shall have
custody of the seal of the Corporation and the Secretary or any Assistant
Secretary, if there is one, shall have authority to affix the same to any
instrument requiring it and when so affixed, it may be attested by the
signature of the Secretary or by the signature of any such Assistant
Secretary. The Board of Directors may give general authority to any other
officer to affix the seal of the Corporation and to attest to the affixing by
such officerÂ’s signature. The Secretary shall see that all books, reports,
statements, certificates and other documents and records required by law to
be kept or filed are properly kept or filed, as the case may be.

ARTICLE V __

 

 _Stock_

 

Section 5.1. _Stock Certificates and Uncertificated Shares_. The shares of
stock in the Corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that
the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or
all of any or all classes or series of the CorporationÂ’s stock shall be
uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares
represented by a certificate theretofore issued until such certificate is
surrendered to the Corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a
resolution by the Board, every holder of stock represented by certificates
shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by or in the name of the
Corporation by the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or the
President or a Vice President, and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer,
or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, of the Corporation, representing
the number of shares of stock registered in certificate form owned by such
holder. If such certificate is manually signed by one officer or manually
countersigned by a transfer agent or by a registrar, any other signature on
the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or
registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a
certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar
before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with
the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent or
registrar at the date of issue.

Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the rights and obligations of
the holders of uncertificated shares and the rights and obligations of the
holders of certificates representing stock of the same class and series shall
be identical.

 



9 Section 5.2. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Stock Certificates; Issuance of
New Certificates_. The Corporation may issue a new certificate of stock or
uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by
it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may
require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such
ownerÂ’s legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to
indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the
alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of
such new certificate or uncertificated shares.

Section 5.3. _Transfers_. Stock of the Corporation shall be transferable in
the manner prescribed by applicable law and in these bylaws. Transfers of
stock shall be made on the books of the Corporation only by the person named
in the certificate or by such personÂ’s attorney lawfully constituted in
writing and upon the surrender of the certificate therefore, properly endorsed
for transfer and payment of all necessary transfer taxes; provided, however,
that such surrender and endorsement or payment of taxes shall not be required
in any case in which the officers of the Corporation shall determine to waive
such requirement. Every certificate exchanged, returned, or surrendered to the
Corporation shall be marked " _Cancelled,_ " with the date of cancellation,
by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Corporation or the transfer
agent thereof. No transfer of stock shall be valid as against the Corporation
for any purpose until it shall have been entered in the stock records of
the Corporation by an entry showing from and to whom transferred.

ARTICLE VI __

 

 _Dividends_

 

Section 6.1. _Declaration_. Dividends upon the capital stock of the
corporation, subject to any restrictions contained in the Delaware General
Corporation Law or the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, if any,
may be declared by the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting.
Dividends may be paid in cash, in property or in shares of capital
stock, subject to the provisions of the certificate of incorporation.

Section 6.2. _Reserve_. Before payment of any dividend, there may be set
aside out of any funds of the corporation available for dividends such sum or
sums as the Board of Directors from time to time, in its absolute discretion,
thinks proper as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for
equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the
corporation, or for such other purpose as the Board of Directors shall think
conducive to the interest of the corporation, and the Board of Directors may
modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created.

ARTICLE VII __

 

 _Miscellaneous_

Section 7.1. _Fiscal Year_. The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be
determined by the Board of Directors.

 



10 Section 7.2. _Seal_. The Corporation may have a corporate seal which shall
have the name of the Corporation inscribed thereon and shall be in such form
as may be approved from time to time by the Board of Directors. The corporate
seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or
affixed or in any other manner reproduced.

Section 7.3. _Checks, Notes, Drafts, Etc._ All checks, notes, drafts or other
orders for the payment of money of the Corporation shall be signed, endorsed
or accepted in the name of the Corporation by such officer, officers, person
or persons as from time to time may be designated by the Board of Directors or
by an officer or officers authorized by the Board of Directors to make such
designation.

Section 7.4. _Waiver of Notice of Meetings of Stockholders, Directors and
Committees_. Whenever notice is required to be given by law or under any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written
waiver thereof or a waiver by electronic transmission, signed or given by the
person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein,
shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting
shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person
attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of
the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the
purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors or
members of a committee of directors need be specified in any waiver of notice
unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.

 

Section 7.5. _Indemnification_. To the fullest extent permitted by the
certificate of incorporation, the Corporation shall indemnify its officers
and directors and, in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, may
indemnify its employees and agents.

ARTICLE VIII __

_Amendment_

 

Section 8.1. _Amendment of Bylaws_. These bylaws may be amended or repealed,
in whole or in part, and new bylaws adopted, by the stockholders or by the
Board of Directors.
