vi AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter called this " _Agreement_ "), dated
as of September 7, 2008, among UST INC., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "), ALTRIA GROUP, INC., a Virginia corporation (" _Parent_ "), and
ARMCHAIR MERGER SUB, INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned indirect
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ," the Company and Merger Sub sometimes
being hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Constituent Corporations_
").

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Merger Sub, Parent and
the Company have approved this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and
into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and have approved and declared
advisable this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, each of Merger Sub, Parent and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1 The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), and the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the
Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

1.2 Closing. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Hunton and Williams LLP, 200 Park Avenue, New York, NY
at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) as promptly as practicable (but in no event later
than the third (3rd) business day) (the " _Closing Date_ ") following the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions; provided that, if
any required pre-approval of any authority regulating the wine Business Unit
(as hereinafter defined) has not been obtained at the time all conditions set
forth in Article VII have been waived or fulfilled (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), then
Parent by written notice to the Company may extend, from time to time, the
Closing Date up to a date not beyond the four (4) month anniversary of the
date of this Agreement). For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _business
day_ " shall mean any day other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which
banks are required or authorized to close in the City of New York. 1.3 Effective Time. At the time of the Closing, the Company and
Parent will cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to
be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with
the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later
date as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of
Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.4 Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects provided
by this Agreement and DGCL and other applicable Law. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of
the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS OF

THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

2.1 The Certificate of Incorporation. The parties hereto shall take
all actions necessary so that the certificate of incorporation of the Company
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Charter_ "), until duly
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

2.2 The Bylaws. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary
so that the bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ "),
until duly amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

ARTICLE III

DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

3.1 Directors. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so
that the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation shall, from and after
the Effective Time, consist of the directors of Merger Sub in office
immediately prior to the Effective Time until their successors have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal in accordance with the Charter, the Bylaws and the DGCL.

3.2 Officers. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed
and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the Charter, the Bylaws and the DGCL.



 

2 ARTICLE IV

EFFECT OF THE MERGER

4.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company, Merger
Sub or the holder of any capital stock of the Company:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the common stock,
par value $0.50 per share, of the Company (a " _Share_ " or collectively, the
" _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company or
any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company (as treasury
stock or otherwise), and (ii) Shares that are owned by stockholders ("
_Dissenting Stockholders_ ") who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (each Share referred to
in clause (i) or clause (ii) being an " _Excluded Share_ " and collectively,
the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive $69.50
per Share in cash (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). At
the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each Share (other than Excluded
Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration, without interest, and each Share owned by Dissenting
Stockholders shall thereafter only represent the right to receive the payment
to which reference is made in Section 4.2(f). The foregoing notwithstanding,
the consummation of the Merger shall not affect any rights relating to the
receipt of a dividend that a holder of Shares on a record date for such
dividend occurring on or before the Effective Time may have.

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to the right of the
holder of any Excluded Share referred to in Section 4.1(a)(ii) to receive
the payment to which reference is made in Section 4.2(f).

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.

4.2 Surrender and Payment.

(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent
and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the holders of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds
necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments under Section 4.1(a) (such
cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Paying
Agent shall invest the cash included in the Payment Fund in obligations
guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America.
All interest earned on such funds shall be paid to Parent; provided, that any
loss incurred on the investment of cash in the Payment Fund shall be solely
for Parents  



 

3  account and shall not relieve Parent from making available the full amount
of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration to holders of Shares.
The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses of the Paying
Agent.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in
any event within five (5) business days thereafter), the Paying Agent shall
mail to each holder of record of (x) a certificate or certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") and (y) any non-certificated shares held by book-entry ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ "), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form
and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably
specify prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in Section 4.1(a).
Exchange of any Book-Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with the
Paying Agents customary procedures with respect to securities represented by
book-entry. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately
available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to (x) the number of Shares
surrendered multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to make all payments required pursuant to
the preceding sentence as soon as practicable following the valid surrender
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. The foregoing notwithstanding, a letter
of transmittal need not be sent to and completed by holders of Book-Entry
Shares unless such a practice is customary for the Paying Agent. In such
event, payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be made promptly
following the Effective Time and without completion of a letter of
transmittal.

In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed in a form reasonably acceptable to
the Paying Agent or otherwise be in proper form for transfer
reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent and the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 4.2(b) each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 4.1(a).

No interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon the
surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares. All Per Share Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares.



 

4 (c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be
no further registration of transfers of Shares on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the Per Share Merger Consideration provided for,
and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this ARTICLE IV.

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of the Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded
Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE IV shall thereafter
look only to Parent for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g))
upon due surrender of its Shares, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder
of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders immediately prior to such time when the amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity) shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the
Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit),
general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity
of any kind or nature.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in a customary
amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay to
such Person an amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to the number of Shares represented by such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

(f) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned
by such Person unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost such Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting
Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section
262 of the DGCL with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder,
except as provided in the preceding sentence. The Company shall (i) give

amended, or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub
or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares.

4.3 Treatment of Stock Plans.

(a) _Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option
to purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") under the Stock Plans, vested or

days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to the product of (i)
the total number of Shares subject to the Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time times (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger

to any year in a performance period or the full performance period
(as applicable) with respect to which performance had been determined prior
to the Effective Time calculated based on actual performance for such year or
period, and (y) the number of shares corresponding to any year in a
performance period or the full performance period (as applicable) with
respect to which performance has not yet been determined as of the Effective
Time calculated based on deemed performance at "target" in accordance with the
terms of the Restricted Share awards for such year or period.

(c) _Restricted Stock Units_. Except with respect to awards granted
on or after the date of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, each
outstanding restricted stock unit (an " _RSU_ ") under the Stock Plans, vested

6  thereof to receive from the Surviving Corporation, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than
seven (7) business days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to
the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time times (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration,

has been determined prior to the Effective Time calculated based on actual
performance for such year or period, and (y) the number of shares
corresponding to any year in a performance period or the full performance
period (as applicable) with respect to which performance has not yet been
determined as of the Effective Time calculated based on deemed performance at
"target" in accordance with the terms of the awards for such year or period.

Corporation, at such times as specified in the applicable Stock Plans or
Benefit Plans, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number
of Shares subject to such Company Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time times (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration (or, if the Company Award
provides for payments to the extent the value of the Shares exceeds a
specified reference price, the amount, if any, by which the Per Share Merger
Consideration exceeds such reference price), less applicable Taxes required
to be withheld with respect to such payment.

(e) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all reasonable actions to implement the provisions of
Sections 4.3(a), 4.3(b), 4.3(c) and 4.3(d). At the Effective Time, Parent
shall provide to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, at its option,
all funds necessary to fulfill its obligations pursuant to this Section 4.3.

4.4 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. Subject to compliance
with Section 6.1, in the event that the Company changes the number of Shares
or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange
offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted.

There is no breach or default under any Material Contract by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to the Knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto and no event has occurred that with or without the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a breach or default thereunder by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto, in each case except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

(s) _Proxy Statement_. None of the information included or
incorporated by reference in the proxy statement to be sent to the
stockholders of the Company in connection with the Stockholders Meeting (such
proxy statement, as amended or supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") will,
at the date it is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company and at the
time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement
will, at the date it is first mailed to stockholders and at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting, comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no
representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by Parent
or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives which
is contained or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement.

(t) _Insurance_. The Company maintains insurance coverage with
insurers, or maintains self-insurance practices, in such amounts and covering
such risks as are in accordance  



 

26  with normal industry practice for companies engaged in businesses similar to
that of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taking into account the cost
and availability of such insurance). Except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, (i) all material insurance policies of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are in full force and effect and provide insurance in such
amounts and against such risks as is sufficient to comply with applicable Law,
(ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach or default,
and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or
failed to take any action which, with notice or the lapse of time, would
constitute such a breach or default, or permit termination or modification of,
any of such insurance policies, and (iii) no written notice of cancellation
or termination has been received with respect to any such policy other than
those received in the ordinary course of business. To the Knowledge of the
Company, as of the date hereof, no insurer which provides material
coverage under any material insurance policy of the Company has been declared
insolvent or placed in receivership, conservatorship or liquidation.

that, as of the date of this Agreement and based upon and subject to the
qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the Per Share Merger
Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
Shares, and, as of the date of this Agreement, such opinions have not been
withdrawn, revoked or modified. To the extent not previously delivered, the
Company, within four (4) business days of the date hereof, will provide copies
of such opinions to Parent.

(v) _Brokers and Finders_. Neither the Company nor any of
its officers, directors or employees has employed any broker or finder or
incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated in this
Agreement, except that the Company has engaged Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
and Perella Weinberg Partners LP as financial advisors. The Company has made
available to Parent true and complete copies of the Companys agreements with
such financial advisors. 

(w) _Related Party Transactions_. To the Knowledge of the Company,
no executive officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any person owning 5% or more of the Shares (or such persons immediate family
members or affiliates or associates) is a party to any Contract with or
has any interest in any property owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or has engaged in any transaction with any of the foregoing since
January 1, 2007, in each case, that is of the type that would be required to
be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act.

(x) _No Additional Representations_. Except as otherwise expressly
set forth in this Section 5.1, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor any other person acting on their behalf makes any representations or
warranties of any kind or nature, express or implied in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and
has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in

materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) _Ownership of Merger Sub; No Prior Activities_. Merger Sub is a
wholly-owned indirect Subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub was formed solely for

 (i) Other than the filings and/or notices pursuant to (a) Section 1.3, (b) under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, (c) other Company Approvals and (d) any such filings and/or notices the failure of which to obtain or make would not prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, no notices, reports or other filings are required to be made by Parent or Merger Sub with, nor are any Consents required to be obtained by Parent or Merger Sub from, any Governmental Entity in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. 

 (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, (a) contravene or conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Merger Sub, (b) with

the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby by Parent does not require the approval of
any holder or holders of any securities of Parent.

(e) _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
Actions pending or, to the knowledge of the officers of Parent, threatened
against Parent or Merger Sub that seek to enjoin, or would reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) _Financing_. Parent and Merger Sub will have available to
them, as of the Closing Date, all funds necessary for the payment to the
Paying Agent of the aggregate amount of the Payment Fund and any other amounts
required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Merger
(including, without limitation, all amounts payable at or following the
Effective Time pursuant to Section 4.3) and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses (the "
_Required Transaction Funds_ "). Parent has provided the Company with a

portion of the Financing which, when added to Parents existing resources,
including its existing credit facilities, will provide funds at least equal
to the Required Transaction Funds. As of the date of this Agreement, the
Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and has not been modified,
withdrawn, terminated or revoked and, to Parents knowledge, is enforceable
against the Lenders in accordance with its terms. Parent and Merger Sub each
acknowledge that a copy of the Commitment Letter is being provided to the
Company for informational purposes only and that none of Parents or Merger
Subs obligations pursuant to this Agreement are subject to any conditions
regarding Parents, Merger Subs or any other Persons ability to obtain
financing, whether pursuant to the Commitment Letter or otherwise.
The financing which Parent anticipates completing in connection with the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
the related fees and expenses is collectively referred to in this Agreement as
the " _Financing_."

34 6.2 No Solicitation of Transactions.

(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries
directors, officers, employees, advisors, attorneys, accountants, investment
bankers and agents (with respect to any Person, the foregoing Persons are
referred to herein as such Persons " _Representatives_ ") not to, (i)
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiry with respect
to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any Takeover Proposal or
(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any substantive
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public
information or data with respect to, or take any other action to

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to receipt of the Requisite
Company Vote, if (i) the Company has not breached this Section 6.2 in any
material respect, and (ii) the Company receives a bona fide written Takeover
Proposal from a third party that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or may reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company may (1) furnish information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal (provided that the
Company shall only provide or permit to be provided to such Person any non-
public information with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries if
(x) such Person has executed a confidentiality agreement that constitutes an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) substantially contemporaneously
with furnishing any such information to such Person, the Company notifies
Parent of such action and furnishes Parent a list of such written information
provided to such Person and, to the extent such written information has not
been previously furnished to Parent and doing so is consistent with applicable
Law, copies of such information), and (2) participate in substantive
discussions and negotiations with such Person regarding such Takeover
Proposal and, to the extent reasonably required to evaluate a Takeover
Proposal, may enter into a customary confidentiality agreement in order to

restrictions described in this Section 6.2.

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.2(b), (i) the
Company Board (or the applicable committee thereof) shall not (x) fail to
make, withdraw, modify or amend, or publicly propose or resolve to withhold,
withdraw, modify or amend, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the
Company Recommendation or (y) approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly
propose or resolve to approve, endorse or recommend, to the Companys
stockholders a Takeover Proposal (other than with Parent) (any action
described in clause (x) or clause (y) immediately above being referred to
herein as a " _Change in Recommendation_ ") and (ii) the Company shall not,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into, and the Company Board (or
the applicable committee thereof) shall not authorize the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to enter into, any merger agreement, letter of intent,
agreement in principle, stock purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement or
stock exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement, in
each case providing for or relating to a Takeover Proposal (each, a  



 

35  " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ "), other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement or an Other Confidentiality Agreement in accordance
with the terms of Section 6.2(a) hereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the receipt of the
Requisite Company Vote, if (i) the Company receives a bona fide written
Takeover Proposal and (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure of the Company Board
to take any of the following actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, then, provided that, in the case of clause (B)
below, the Company has not breached this Section 6.2 in any material respect
and the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) that the Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the
Company Board, after compliance with the procedure set forth in the following
sentence, may (A) make a Change in Recommendation and/or (B) cause the Company
or any Subsidiary thereof to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal, but only if the Company shall have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(a) hereof substantially
concurrently with entering into such Company Acquisition Agreement. The
Company Board shall not make such Change in Recommendation or enter into (or
permit any Subsidiary to enter into) such Company Acquisition Agreement,
unless (w) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at least seventy-
two (72) hours (the " _Notice Period_ ") before making a Change in
Recommendation or entering into (or causing a Subsidiary to enter into) a
Company Acquisition Agreement, of its intention to take such action with
respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall state expressly that the
Company has received a Takeover Proposal that the Company Board intends to
declare a Superior Proposal and that the Company Board intends to make a
Change in Recommendation and/or the Company intends to enter into a Company
Acquisition Agreement, (x) the Company attaches to such notice the most
current version of the proposed agreement (which version shall be updated on a
prompt basis) and the identity of the third party making such Superior
Proposal, (y) the Company negotiates in good faith with Parent and provides
Parent the opportunity to submit to, and negotiate with, the Company during
the Notice Period adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
intended by Parent to cause such Takeover Proposal to cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal (it being agreed that in the event that, after commencement
of the Notice Period, there is any material revision to the terms of a
Superior Proposal, including, any revision in price, the Notice Period shall
be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least seventy-two (72) hours
remain in the Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company notifies Parent
of any such material revision (it being understood that there may be multiple
extensions)) and (z) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consulting with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, that such Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal after taking into account any adjustments made by Parent
during the Notice Period in the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the receipt of the
Requisite Company Vote and subject to subsection (d) of this Section 6.2, the
Company may make a Change in Recommendation unrelated to receipt of a
Takeover Proposal if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure of the Company Board
to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided, however, that no Change in Recommendation may be made until after
at least seventy-two (72) 



 

36  hours following Parents receipt of notice from the Company of its intention
to take such action and the basis therefor.

(c) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in
this Section 6.2, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event
later than forty-eight (48) hours) after it obtains Knowledge of the receipt
(or, if applicable, the making of any judgment provided for in this sentence)
by any member of the Company Board, the Company, any Subsidiary or any of
their Representatives of: (i) any Takeover Proposal, (ii) any offer or
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal,
(iii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books
or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any third party, and
(iv) any request to enter into or continue any discussions or negotiations by
any third party, in the case of (iii) or (iv), that the Company Board believes
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal. In such notice,
the Company shall identify the third party making, and the key terms and
conditions of (in reasonable detail), any such Takeover Proposal, indication
or request. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt
basis, of the status and material terms of any such Takeover Proposal,
including any material amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other
material terms thereof. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall,
after the date of this Agreement, enter into any confidentiality or
similar agreement that would prohibit it from providing such information to
Parent.

(d) Subject to Parents rights under ARTICLE VIII hereof, nothing in
this Section 6.2 shall prohibit the Company Board from taking and disclosing
to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule
14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or
other applicable Law, if the Company Board determines (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that failure to so disclose such position could
constitute a violation of applicable Law, provided that neither the Company
nor the Company Board may make a Change in Recommendation unless permitted by
this Section 6.2 or otherwise required by applicable Law. In addition, it is
agreed that, for purposes of this Section 6.2, (i) a factually accurate public
statement by the Company that only describes the Companys receipt of a
Takeover Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto
and contains a "stop-look-and-listen communication" shall not be deemed a
Change in Recommendation and (ii) no disclosure required by applicable Law
made by the Company regarding actions or communications required to be made
by it in order to comply with any of the provisions of this Section 6.2 shall
constitute a breach of such section (it being understood that any such
required disclosure shall not affect the Companys continuing obligation to
comply with the underlying actions or communications required by this Section
6.2 and any failure to comply with the provisions of this Section 6.2 shall
have the consequences otherwise provided for in this Agreement).

(e) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person from
the restrictions on "business combinations" contained in the Companys
certificate of incorporation or Section 203 of the DGCL (or any similar
provisions) or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply unless
such actions are taken simultaneously with a termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 8.3(a).



 

37 (f) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated,
and shall cause its Affiliates and Subsidiaries and its or their
Representatives to terminate, all existing discussions or negotiations, if
any, with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or that
could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal and will request
any such parties (and their agents or advisors) in possession of confidential
information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to return or
destroy such information. 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

" _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a confidentiality and
standstill agreement that contains confidentiality and, subject to the
proviso in this definition, standstill provisions that are generally no less
favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, provided, that in the event that the Company enters into a
confidentiality agreement with a Person making a Takeover Proposal that does
not include a "standstill" provision or contains a "standstill" provision less
favorable to the Company than the corresponding provision of
the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent and its Affiliates shall, without
further action by the Company, be released from the "standstill" provision
under the Confidentiality Agreement to the extent necessary to render
such "standstill" provision of the Confidentiality Agreement no more
favorable to the Company than the "standstill," if any, applicable to the
Person making such Takeover Proposal.

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Takeover Proposal involving
the direct or indirect acquisition of all or substantially all of the
Companys consolidated assets or 50% or more of the outstanding total voting
equity interests of the Company, that the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation) is more favorable to the Companys
stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, taking into account, if and to the extent deemed material
to its determination, among other factors, (i) financial considerations, (ii)
the identity of the third party making such Takeover Proposal, (iii) the
anticipated timing, conditions and prospects for completion of such Takeover
Proposal (as compared to the transactions contemplated hereby), (iv) the other
terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal and the implications thereof on
the Company, including relevant legal, regulatory and other aspects of
such Takeover Proposal, (v) the availability of financing to the third party
making such Takeover Proposal and (vi) any revisions to the terms of this
Agreement and the Merger proposed by Parent during the Notice Period set forth
in Section 6.2(b).

" _Takeover Proposal_ " means a proposal or offer from, or indication of
interest in making a proposal or offer by, any Person (other than Parent and
its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub) relating to any (i) direct or indirect
acquisition (in one transaction or a series of transactions) of assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries, but
excluding sales of assets in the ordinary course of business) equal to twenty
percent (20%) or more of the fair market value of the Companys consolidated
assets or to which twenty percent (20%) or more of the Companys net sales or
total income on a consolidated basis are attributable, (ii) direct or indirect
acquisition of twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting equity interests of
the Company, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would
result in any Person beneficially owning (within the meaning of Section 13(d)
of the Exchange Act) twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting equity
interests of the Company, (iv) merger, consolidation, share  



 

38  exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution
or similar transaction involving the Company, in each case as a result of
which the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such transaction
would hold less than eighty percent (80%) of the voting equity interests in
the surviving or resulting entity in such transaction or (v) liquidation or
dissolution (or the adoption of a plan of liquidation or dissolution) of the
Company or the declaration or payment of an extraordinary dividend (whether in
cash or other property) by the Company.

6.3 Proxy Statement. As promptly as practicable following the date
of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the
preliminary Proxy Statement, and in any event the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to file the Proxy Statement with the SEC within twenty
(20) business days after the date of this Agreement. The Company and Parent
will cooperate and consult with each other in preparation of the Proxy
Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the
Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself and its
Affiliates that is required to be included in the Proxy Statement or that is
customarily included in proxy statements prepared in connection with
transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the
Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts, after consultation
with the other, to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the
SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be cleared
by the SEC and mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable following clearance from the SEC. The Company shall promptly
notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or
any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the
Proxy Statement and shall promptly provide Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand, relating to the Proxy
Statement.

If at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to
the Company or Parent and Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so
that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed
with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall
provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response, and to the extent practicable and related to matters
involving Parent, the Company will provide Parent with the opportunity to
participate in any substantive calls between the Company, or any of its
Representatives, and the SEC concerning the Proxy Statement.



 

39 6.4 Stockholders Meeting. In accordance with applicable Law and its
certificate of incorporation and bylaws and unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with ARTICLE VIII, the Company shall duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of holders of Shares (including any
adjournments or postponements thereof, the " _Stockholders Meeting_ ") solely
for the purpose of considering and taking action upon this Agreement and use
its reasonable best efforts to cause such Stockholders Meeting to occur as
promptly as practicable after the date the Proxy Statement is cleared by the
SEC to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Vote, regardless of whether the
Company Board determines at any time that this Agreement or the Merger is no
longer advisable. Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
ARTICLE VIII, once the Stockholders Meeting has been called and noticed, the
Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting without the
consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (other
than (i) for the absence of a quorum or (ii) to the extent required by
applicable Law; provided that in the event that the Stockholders Meeting is
delayed to a date after the End Date as a result of either (i) or (ii) above,
then the End Date shall be extended to the tenth (10th) business day after
such date). Subject to Section 6.2, the Company Board shall recommend such
adoption and shall include the Company Recommendation and, subject to the
consent of the Companys financial advisors, the written opinions of
the financial advisors, dated as of the date of this Agreement, that, as of
such date, the Per Share Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point
of view, to the Companys stockholders in the Proxy Statement and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to solicit such adoption of this Agreement and
the Merger and take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable to
secure the vote or consent of stockholders required by applicable Law to
effect the Merger. The Company shall keep Parent updated with respect to
proxy solicitation results to the extent reasonably requested by Parent.

6.5 Cooperation; Filings; Other Actions.

(a) _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use
(and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or
cause to be done and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing,
all things, necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective,

contemplated by clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) immediately above and (y) supply
 



 

40  the other with any information that may be reasonably required in order to
effectuate the taking of such actions. Subject to applicable Laws, Parent and
the Company shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult with the other on and consider in good faith
the views of the other in connection with all filings made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

(b) _Information_. Subject to applicable Laws, the Company and
Parent each shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or

filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) _Communications with Governmental Entities_. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub and the Company will (x) promptly notify the other party of any
communication to that party from any Governmental Entity and, subject to
applicable Law, permit the other party to review in advance any proposed

other partys reasonable comments, (y) not agree to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any such Governmental Entity in respect
of any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement, the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the

Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend, and (z) furnish the
other party with copies of all correspondence, filings and
written communications between them and their affiliates and their respective
Representatives on one hand, and any such Governmental Entity or its staff on
the other hand, with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other

this Section 6.5, materials provided to the other party or its counsel may be
redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements
or requirements of applicable Law and (iii) as necessary to address good faith
legal privilege or confidentiality concerns.

(d) _Regulatory Matters_. Without limiting the generality of
the undertakings pursuant to this Section 6.5, the parties hereto shall (i)
provide or cause to be provided as promptly as reasonably practicable to
Governmental Entities with jurisdiction over any Antitrust Laws information
and documents requested by any Governmental Entity as necessary, proper or
advisable to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including preparing and filing any notification and report form and
related material required under the HSR Act and any additional consents and
filings under any other Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable following
the date of this Agreement (provided that in the case of the filing under the
HSR Act, such filing shall be made on or prior to the tenth (10th) business
day following the date of this Agreement (unless otherwise agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto)) and thereafter to respond as promptly as
practicable to any request for additional information or documentary material
that may be made under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws, and
(ii) subject to the terms set forth in Section 6.5(e) hereof, use their
reasonable best efforts to take  



 

41  such actions as are necessary or advisable to obtain prompt approval of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
any Governmental Entity or expiration of applicable waiting periods. Neither
Parent nor the Company shall commit to or agree (or permit their respective
Subsidiaries to commit to or agree) with any Governmental Entity to stay, toll
or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable
Antitrust Laws, without the prior written consent of the other party (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

Each of the parties hereto will (i) use its reasonable best efforts to contest
on the merits, through litigation in United States District Court (or state
court, if applicable) or other applicable courts or through administrative or
other procedures, any objections or opposition raised by any Governmental
Entity or other Person in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to defend on appeal any
favorable Order on the merits in United States District Court (or state court,

the contrary, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates shall be
required to, and the Company may not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take
any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation,
understanding, agreement or order to (i) sell, license, assign, transfer,
divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion
of business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective affiliates, (ii) conduct, restrict, operate, invest or
otherwise change the assets, business or portion of business of the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
affiliates in any manner, or (iii) impose any restriction, requirement or
limitation on the operation of the business or portion of the business of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates; provided that, if requested by Parent, the Company will
become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any
action with respect to, any such requirement, condition,
limitation, understanding, agreement or order so long as such requirement,
condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order is only binding on
the Company in the event the Closing occurs.

(f) _Third Party Consents_. Without limiting the generality of
the other undertakings pursuant to this Section 6.5, each of the Company and
Parent shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any third
party consents (i) identified and mutually agreed by the parties after the
date hereof or (ii) required to prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect
from occurring prior to the Effective Time. In the event that the Company
shall fail to obtain any third party consent described above, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall take such actions as are
reasonably requested by Parent, to minimize any adverse effect upon the
Company and Parent and Merger Sub and their respective businesses resulting,
or which would reasonably be expected to result, after the Effective Time,
from the failure to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or
consent from any Person (other than a Governmental Entity) with  



 

42  respect to any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (i) unless
required by the applicable agreement, without the prior written consent of
Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to pay to such Person
whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration,
make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation due to such
Person and (ii) neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor their respective Affiliates
shall be required to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or
consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any
commitment or incur any liability or other obligation.

6.6 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, upon
obtaining knowledge of (i) any notice or other communication received by such
party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, or from any person alleging
that the Consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the
Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Actions commenced or,
to such partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to
this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii)
any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (a) in the case of the
Company, individually or taken together with all other facts, events and
circumstances known to it, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (b) would
cause or constitute, or would reasonably be expected to cause or constitute,
a breach in any material respect of any such partys representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein, (c) would cause or would
reasonably be expected to cause, the failure of any condition precedent
to Parents or the Companys obligations under this Agreement, or (d) would
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however,
that (x) the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall not
limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to Parent or the Company, as
applicable, or prevent or cure any misrepresentations, breach of warranty or
breach of covenant or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under
this Agreement, (y) disclosure by the Company or Parent shall not be deemed to
amend or supplement the Company Disclosure Letter or constitute an exception
to any representation or warranty except to the extent expressly agreed by
Parent and the Company, and (z) no disclosure hereunder shall be deemed to be
an admission to the other party that any condition set forth in ARTICLE VII
has not been fulfilled. This Section 6.6 shall not constitute a covenant or
agreement for purposes of Section 7.2(b) or Section 7.3(b).

6.7 Access and Reports.

(a) From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, upon
reasonable prior written notice, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and their Representatives to, afford the Representatives of
Parent reasonable access, consistent with applicable Law, at all reasonable
times to its Representatives, properties, offices, and other facilities and to
all books and records and shall furnish Parent with all financial, operating
and other data and information as Parent, through its Representatives, may
from time to time reasonably request (provided that no investigation pursuant
to this Section 6.7 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation
or warranty made by the Company herein). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)
the right of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall be of no
force and effect to  



 

43  the extent that Parent and Merger Sub (or either of them) is in material
breach of any covenant or agreement hereunder, and (ii) any such
investigation or consultation shall be conducted during normal business hours
in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any
significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by such
employees of their normal duties. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information
(x) where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the Company or its Subsidiaries or contravene any Law (it being
agreed that the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts, to the extent
applicable, to cause such information to be provided in a manner that
would not result in such jeopardy or contravention), (y) which it is required
to keep confidential by reason of contract or (z) which, in the reasonable
opinion of the Company, constitute trade secrets or other sensitive materials
or information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, neither Parent nor
its Representatives shall have the right to conduct any environmental sampling
or testing at any of the properties of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

(b) Parent will hold and treat and will cause its Representatives to
hold and treat in confidence all documents and information concerning the
Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to Parent and its Representatives in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
neither party will give any notice of termination under the Confidentiality
Agreement, provided that paragraph 11 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate on the first (1st) anniversary of this Agreement.

6.8 Publicity. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be
a joint press release reasonably agreed to by both Parent and the Company.
Thereafter the Company and Parent each shall consult with each other prior to
issuing, and provide each other with the opportunity to review and comment
upon, any press releases or otherwise making public announcements with respect
to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
prior to making any filings with any third party (including any national
securities exchange) with respect thereto, except as may be required by Law or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
national securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the
release or announcement shall, unless it relates to a Takeover Proposal, use
its reasonable best efforts to provide the other party reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

6.9 Employee Benefits.

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
December 31, 2009, Parent agrees that it or its Subsidiaries shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide the employees of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (other than
those covered by collective bargaining agreements) with (i) aggregate base
salary, bonus and long-term incentive opportunities (including the value of
equity-based long-term incentives) that are no less favorable than the
aggregate base salary, bonus and long-term incentive opportunities (including
the value of equity-based long-term incentives) provided by the Company and
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (provided that,
subject to the foregoing, Parent and its affiliates shall have no obligation
to offer equity or equity-based compensation or benefits to any employee) and
(ii) except as set forth in Section 6.9(a)(ii) of the  



 

44  Company Disclosure Letter, employee benefits (excluding those related to
equity) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by
the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Following the Effective Time, for the period specified therein, eligible
employees of the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to the severance
benefits described in Section 6.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. In
addition, Parent shall have entered into employment agreements with the
persons listed on Section 6.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter as of the
date hereof, to become effective as of the Effective Time. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall obligate Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates to retain the employment of any
particular employee.

(b) Parent shall cause any employee benefit plans which the employees
of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries are entitled to participate
in (to the extent such employees are eligible and participate) to take into
account for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual thereunder,
service by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than those
covered by collective bargaining agreements) as if such service were with
Parent, to the same extent such service was credited under a comparable plan
of the Company (except to the extent it would result in (1) a duplication of
benefits or (2) benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan), it
being understood that all service of eligible employees shall be recognized
for purposes of the severance benefits described in Section 6.9(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, irrespective of participating in a comparable
severance plan of the Company. For the calendar year including the Effective
Time, employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall not
be required to satisfy any deductible, co-payment, out-of-pocket maximum or
similar requirements under any welfare benefit plans provided for the benefit
of such employees following the Effective Time (" _Post-Closing
Welfare Plans_ ") to the extent of amounts previously credited for such
purposes under the Benefit Plans that provide medical, dental and other
welfare benefits. Any waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions and
requirements to show evidence of good health contained in such Post-Closing
Welfare Plans shall be waived with respect to the employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries.

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any
successor thereto to honor, fulfill and discharge in accordance with their
terms all plans, contracts, agreements, arrangements and commitments of the
Company and its Subsidiaries disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter and in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time that are applicable to any
current or former employees or directors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their predecessors; provided that this shall not
prevent the amendment or termination of any such plans, contracts, agreements,
arrangements or commitments in accordance with their terms and, except as
disclosed in Section 6.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Surviving
Corporation shall have any rights, privileges or powers under the Benefit
Plans which were previously held by the Company.

(d) The Company shall be permitted, prior to the Effective Time, (I)
to pay annual bonuses to each participant in the Company Incentive
Compensation Plan for 2008 in the aggregate not to exceed the aggregate amount
set forth in Section 6.9(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter payable for each
participant for the 2007 calendar year and (II) subject to Parents consent
(not to be unreasonably withheld); to establish bonus targets, maximums and
performance goals for 2009 in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice; provided that this shall not prevent the amendment or
termination of any such plans in  



 

45  accordance with their terms and the Surviving Corporation shall have any
rights, privileges or powers under the Company Benefit Plan which were
previously held by the Company. In the event the Effective Time occurs in
2009, the Company shall be permitted to pay a pro-rata annual bonus for the
2009 calendar year. For this purpose, each employee who was designated as a
participant in the Companys Incentive Compensation Plan for 2008 shall be
deemed to be a designated participant in such plan for 2009.

(e) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" or "change
of control" for purposes of all applicable Benefit Plans shall be deemed to
have occurred no later than the Effective Time.

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.9 are solely for the benefit of
the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, officer or
director or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for
any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing
herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Benefit Plan for any purpose.

6.10 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.6, whether or
not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expense, provided

Company counsel) incurred or paid in connection with filings pursuant to the

transactions contemplated hereby.

6.11 Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance.

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation agrees that it will and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law (and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance
expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
provided that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification), each present and former director
and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement (provided, however, with respect to any settlement
effected, the Surviving Corporation will not be liable without its prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed))
as a result of any Action (as defined below) (collectively, " _Costs_ ")
incurred in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit,
proceeding, hearing, arbitration or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (collectively, " _Action_ "), arising out of
or related to such Indemnified Parties service as a director or officer of
the Company or its Subsidiaries (or as a director, officer or trustee of any
Employee Benefit Plan at the request of the Company) whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement but only to the extent related to actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. An Indemnified Party
shall have the right to have any  



 

46  determinations regarding indemnification made by an independent counsel,
reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation and selected by such
Indemnified Party.

(b) The Surviving Corporation will cause the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation to contain for a period of not
less than 6 years following the Effective Time, provisions consistent with the
provisions of the certificate of incorporation of the Company in effect as of
the date hereof providing for the exculpation of directors from monetary
liabilities. In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 6.11(a),
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will honor, and Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, and any successor to the
Surviving Corporation shall honor, the indemnification obligations set forth
in the Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws, in effect on the
date hereof, as well as the terms of any indemnification agreements, in the
form provided to Parent, previously entered into with directors and/or
officers of the Company, in connection with any acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries,
for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time for the
persons who, as of the date of this Agreement, are covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policies, directors and
officers liability insurance policies that provide coverage for events
occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that are no
less favorable in both amount and terms and conditions of coverage than the
existing policies of the Company (true and complete copies of which have
previously been made available to Parent) or, if substantially equivalent
insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage, in either
case from insurance carriers with financial strength ratings equal to or
greater than the financial strength ratings of the Companys existing
directors and officers liability insurance carriers; provided, however,
that, in lieu of the foregoing, the Company or the Surviving Corporation may,
or if requested by Parent and available, the Company shall, purchase a six-
year "tail" coverage that is no less favorable in both amount and terms and
conditions of coverage than the existing policies of the Company from
insurance carriers with financial strength ratings equal to or greater than
the financial strength ratings of the Companys existing directors and
officers liability insurance carriers; provided further that in no event
shall the Surviving Corporation be required to, and the Company shall not be
permitted to, pay annual premiums for insurance under this Section 6.11(b) in
excess of 300% of the amount of the current aggregate annual premiums paid by
the Company in respect of such coverage (which for purposes of tail coverage
shall take into account that the entire premium may be paid upfront, but that
the coverage extends for a multi-year period); provided, further, that if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain policies with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then,
and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, shall assume all of the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.11.



 

47 (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action
(whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is brought against
any Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.11 shall continue in effect
until the final disposition of such Action.

(f) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and
legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.

6.12 Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute or any takeover
provision in the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws is or may
become applicable to this Agreement (including the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), each of Parent and the Company
and their respective boards of directors shall promptly grant such approvals
and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise promptly act to eliminate the effects of such Takeover
Statute, regulation or provision on such transactions.

6.13 Financing Cooperation.

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide to Parent and
Merger Sub, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries
to, provide to Parent and Merger Sub all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent that is necessary or reasonably required in connection with the
Financing, including the following: (i) using reasonable best efforts to cause
the Companys senior officers and other Representatives to participate in
meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions (including
accounting due diligence sessions), drafting sessions and sessions with rating
agencies; (ii) assisting with the preparation of appropriate and customary
materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, bank
information memoranda and similar documents proper or advisable in connection
with the Financing; (iii) using its reasonable best efforts to assist with the
preparation of any loan agreement, currency or interest hedging agreement,
other definitive financing documents on terms satisfactory to Parent, provided
that (A) there shall be no obligation to deliver any certificate, opinion,
comfort letter or any other document as a condition to the Financing and (B)
no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any such
document or agreement shall be effective until the Effective Time; (iv) using
reasonable best efforts to furnish on a confidential basis to Parent and
Merger Sub and their financing sources, as promptly as practicable, with
financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent and that is within the
Companys possession and in the form that the Company customarily prepares
and within the timeframes so prepared; (v) providing monthly financial
statements (excluding footnotes) to the extent the Company customarily
prepares such financial statements within the time such statements are
customarily prepared; and (vi) using reasonable best efforts, as appropriate,
to have its independent accountants provide its reasonable cooperation and
assistance; provided, however, that nothing herein or in this Agreement shall
require such cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably interfere with
the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries; and provided
further; that notwithstanding  



 

48  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, until the Effective Time occurs,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to adopt
any resolutions, assume any obligations thereunder or pay any commitment or
other similar fee or give any indemnities. The foregoing notwithstanding,
nothing in this Section 6.13 shall limit or restrict the obligation of Parent
and Merger Sub to implement this Agreement and no failure of the Company, and
its subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to perform any of
their respective obligations pursuant to this Section 6.13 shall directly or
indirectly provide any basis for Parent or Merger Sub to fail to perform its
obligations pursuant to this Agreement, unless any refusal by the Company to
take action required pursuant to this Section 6.13 is intentionally done for
the purpose of preventing the Financing from occurring prior to the End Date.
Parent shall, promptly upon written request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses to the extent
such costs are incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries at the written
request of Parent in connection with the cooperation provided pursuant to this
Section 6.13 and Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees
and Representatives from and against any and all Costs suffered or incurred
by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing, except in the
event that such Costs arose out of a knowing and material breach of this
Section 6.13. 

(b) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the Closing
is not conditioned on the availability of the Required Transaction Funds.

(c) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing; provided that such logos
are used solely in a manner that is not intended or reasonably likely to harm
or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and its or their marks or
create the impression that the Company has any obligations thereunder unless
and until the Effective Time occurs.

6.14 Resignations. At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation effective as of
the Effective Time of those directors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries designated by Parent to the Company reasonably in advance of the
Closing.

opportunity to participate in, but not control, the defense or settlement of
any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or any of its directors or
officers relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and no such settlement of any stockholder litigation
shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

6.16 Company Debt Obligations/Related Matters.

(a) Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
take, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to take, all actions
required by the applicable provisions of each of the Companys debt
obligations including, without limitation, the providing of any required
notices and the payment of all fees and expenses (including repaying amounts
 



 

49  outstanding and offering to repurchase outstanding notes, in either instance
to the extent required) in a timely manner.

(b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, with
funds sufficient to satisfy any funding obligations under payment schedules
(previously shared with Parent in a writing identified therein as responsive
to this Section 6.16(b) and as such schedules may be adjusted in accordance
with terms of the underlying plans or agreements) pursuant to the rabbi trusts
identified on Section 6.16(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, which payment
schedules shall indicate the amounts payable to each rabbi trust in respect
of such participants on a participant by participant basis in accordance with
current assumptions, separated by type of benefit.

definitive agreement with respect to, (y) approved or recommended to the
Companys stockholders, or (z) consummated, a Takeover Proposal (in each case,
whether or not such Takeover Proposal is the same as the original Takeover
Proposal made, communicated or publicly announced), then the Company shall
pay to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available funds), upon the
earlier of the Company entering into the agreement with respect to such
Takeover Proposal or the consummation of such transaction, the Termination
Fee. For purposes of this Section 8.6(d), all references in the definition of
Takeover Proposal to 20% shall be deemed to be references to "a majority." The
parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Company be obligated
to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. The provisions of this
Section 8.6(d) shall not apply if the provisions of Section 8.6(g) are
applicable.



 

54 (e) The Company acknowledges and hereby agrees that the provisions of
this Section 8.6 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger), and that, without such provisions, Parent
and Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement. If the Company
shall fail to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this Section
8.6, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim against the
Company that results in a judgment against the Company, the Company shall pay
to Parent the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses of
Parent (including its reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in
this Section 8.6 at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made plus 1% per annum. Any interest payable
hereunder shall be calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts
were required to be paid until (but excluding) the date of actual payment,
and on the basis of a 360-day year.

(f) If this Agreement is terminated and the Termination Fee is payable
to Parent as a result thereof, in addition to the payment of the Termination
Fee, the Company shall reimburse Parent and Merger Sub for all expenses in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, up to
a maximum of $10,000,000 incurred by Parent and Merger Sub (the " _Expense
Fee_ _")_ which Expense Fee shall be payable at the same time as the
Termination Fee. For purposes of the preceding sentence, expenses means all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses (including all reasonable
fees and expenses of outside counsel, accountants, financing sources,
investment bankers, experts and consultants) incurred in connection with or
related to the due diligence, authorization, preparation, negotiation,
execution and performance of this Agreement, the obtaining of the financing
for the Merger, and all other matters related to the consummation of the
Merger.

(g) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or
(ii) the Merger has not been consummated by the End Date, except in either
case under circumstances where the Board of Directors of Parent has
determined in accordance with its good faith business judgment that Parent is
permitted under this Agreement to terminate this Agreement or is not required
to consummate the Merger prior to the End Date, then Parent shall promptly
following receipt of written notice from the Company requesting such payment,
pay the Company a non-refundable fee equal to $200,000,000 (the " _Reverse
Termination Fee_ "), payable by wire transfer of same day funds to an account
designated in writing to Parent by the Company. The Reverse Termination Fee
shall be the Companys exclusive remedy for damages in circumstances where it
is applicable (unless in any such circumstance it is requested in accordance
with the preceding sentence but not paid, in which event the Company shall be
entitled to elect to seek either the Reverse Termination Fee or, subject to
the last sentence of Section 9.8, damages (but not both)); and, once paid,
the Company shall have no right to specific performance under Section 9.9, it
being understood that if the Merger is not consummated because Parent has not
obtained the Requisite Transaction Funds or under circumstances where the
Board of Directors of Parent has not made the foregoing determination, the
Company may elect to seek specific performance under Section 9.9 in lieu of
requesting payment of the Reverse Termination Fee or seeking damages if the
Reverse Termination Fee is requested but not paid. For the avoidance of
doubt, (i) the Reverse Termination Fee will not be payable if the Merger is
not consummated as a result of antitrust related matters, including Parents
breach of its obligations under Section 6.5 with respect to using its
reasonable best efforts to obtain antitrust clearance for the Merger, but, in
the event of such breach, the Company shall be entitled to seek damages or
specific performance  



 

55  under Section 9.9, and (ii) if a determination by the Board of Directors of
Parent referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph is shown by final
judicial determination to not have been a good faith business judgment
(including, for example, if made under circumstances where the Merger is not
consummated because Parent has not obtained the Requisite Transaction Funds),
the Company shall be entitled to elect to be paid the Reverse Termination Fee
in accordance with the first sentence of this paragraph.

(h) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and hereby agree that the
provisions of this Section 8.6 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), and that, without such
provisions, the Company would not have entered into this Agreement. If Parent
shall fail to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this Section
8.6, and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company makes a claim against
Parent that results in a judgment against Parent, Parent shall pay to the
Company the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the
Company (including its reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in
this Section 8.6 at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made plus 1% per annum. Any interest payable
hereunder shall be calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were
required to be paid until (but excluding) the date of actual payment, and on
the basis of a 360-day year.

(i) If this Agreement is terminated and the Reverse Termination Fee is
payable to the Company as a result thereof, in addition to the payment of the
Termination Fee, the Parent shall reimburse the Company for all expenses in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, up to
a maximum of $10,000,000 incurred by the Company (the " _Company Expense Fee_
") which Company Expense Fee shall be payable at the same time as the Reverse
Termination Fee. For purposes of the preceding sentence, expenses means all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses (including all reasonable
fees and expenses of outside counsel, accountants, financing sources,
investment bankers, experts and consultants) incurred in connection with or
related to the due diligence, authorization, preparation, negotiation,
execution and performance of this Agreement, the preparation, printing, filing
and mailing of the Proxy Statement, the solicitation of the Requisite Company
Vote, and all other matters related to the consummation of the Merger.

ARTICLE IX

MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL

9.1 Survival. None of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of such
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, shall survive the
Effective Time, except for those covenants and agreements contained herein
that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after
the Effective Time.

9.2 Modification or Amendment. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, by written
agreement signed by each of the parties hereto; provided, however, that
following the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, there shall  



 

56  be no amendment or supplement to the provisions of this Agreement which by
Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant self regulatory
organization would require further approval by the holders of Shares without
such approval.

9.3 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger
Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other party(ies),
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party(ies) contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered under this
Agreement, or (c) unless prohibited by applicable Law, waive compliance with
any of the covenants, agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement.
Any agreement on the part of a party to any extension or waiver will be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such party. The
failure of any party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise will not constitute a waiver of such rights.

9.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed (including by
facsimile) in any number of counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed
to be an original instrument, and all such counterparts shall together
constitute the same agreement.

9.5 GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY
TRIAL. (a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to choice of
law principles that would cause the laws of another jurisdiction to apply).

(b) Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the
personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if
under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction over such matter is vested in the
federal courts, any court of the United States located in the State of
Delaware, in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction over such matter
is vested in the federal courts, any court of the United States located in
the State of Delaware and (iv) consents to service being made through the
notice procedures set forth in Section 9.6. Each party hereto hereby agrees
that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective
addresses set forth in Section 9.6 shall be effective service of process for
any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. 

(c) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively
do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby in any Delaware State or Federal
court in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.5. Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action
or proceeding in any such court.



 

57 (d) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii)
EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.5.

terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this Section 9.9
are not available or otherwise are not granted and (y) nothing contained in
this Section 9.9 shall require any party to institute any proceeding for (or
limit any partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance
under this Section 9.9 before exercising any termination right under ARTICLE
VIII (and pursuing damages after such termination) nor shall the commencement
of any Action pursuant to this Section 9.9 or anything contained in this
Section 9.9 restrict or limit any partys right to terminate this Agreement in

this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such
other Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein
with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as
