following will occur:

  



  

   

 | -19-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i)  each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation, and thereupon each certificate representing ownership of such
shares of common stock of Merger Sub will thereafter represent ownership of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation;

  



  

(ii)  each share of Class A Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned
Company Shares or Dissenting Company Shares) will automatically be cancelled,
extinguished and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal
to $11.75, without interest thereon (the "Per Share Price"), in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.9_ (or in the case of a lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if
required) in accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.11_), subject to
applicable withholding for any required Taxes pursuant to _Section 2.12_ ;
and

  



  

(iii)  each share of Class A Common Stock that is owned by Parent,
Merger Sub or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or by
the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Owned
Company Shares") will cease to be outstanding and will automatically be
cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration
paid therefor.

  



  

(b)   _Adjustment to the Per Share Price_. The Per Share Price
will be adjusted appropriately (but without any increase in the aggregate
amounts payable by Parent hereunder) to reflect the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other
distribution of securities convertible into Class A Common Stock),
subdivision, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with
respect to the Class A Common Stock occurring on or after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time in order to provide the
same economic effect as contemplated in this Agreement prior to such change.

  



  

(c)   _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

  



  

(i)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, all shares of Class A Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders
who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in
writing and who is entitled to exercise and who shall have properly and
validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such
shares of Class A Common Stock in accordance with, and in compliance
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Company Shares") will not be
converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Per Share Price
pursuant to this _Section 2.7_. Such Company Stockholders will be entitled to
receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL and such Dissenting
Company Shares shall without any further action cease to be outstanding, be
cancelled and cease to exist, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held
by Company Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting
Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will thereupon be deemed
to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Price, without interest
thereon, upon surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares that
formerly evidenced such shares of Class A Common Stock in the manner provided
in _Section 2.9, _subject to applicable withholding for any required Taxes
pursuant to _Section 2.12_.

  



  

   

 | -20-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii)  The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt written notice
(and in any event within one Business Day) of any demands for appraisal
received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect of
Dissenting Company Shares; and (B) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any payment or offer to make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment in respect
of Dissenting Company Shares, or waive any failure to timely deliver a
written demand for appraisal or otherwise comply with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, or agree or commit to do any of the foregoing. Any
amount made available to the Paying Agent to pay for Dissenting
Company Shares shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

  



  

2.8 _  _ _Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a)   _Company RSUs_. Parent will not assume any Company RSUs and at
the Effective Time each Company RSU outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will, without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to (i) the amount of the Per Share Price;
multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Class A Common Stock subject
to such Company RSU (the "Company RSU Consideration"). The payment of the
Company RSU Consideration will be subject to withholding for all required
Taxes pursuant to _Section 2.12_.

  



  

(b)   _Company Options_. Parent will not assume any Company Options
and at the Effective Time each Company Option outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will, by virtue of the
Merger without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the amount of the
Per Share Price (less the exercise price per share attributable to such
Company Option); multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Class A
Common Stock issuable upon exercise in full of such Company Option (the
"Option Consideration"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, with respect to Company Options for which the exercise price per
share attributable to such Company Options is equal to or greater than the
Per Share Price, such Company Options will be cancelled without any cash
payment being made in respect thereof. The payment of the Option Consideration
will be subject to withholding for all required Taxes pursuant to _Section
2.12_.

  



  

   

 | -21-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c)   _Payment Procedures_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Company, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the aggregate (i) Company RSU Consideration owed
to all holders of Company RSUs and (ii) Option Consideration owed to all
holders of Company Options. As soon as practicable after the Closing
Date, but in any event no later than the first regularly scheduled payroll
date that is at least five Business Days following the Closing Date, the
applicable holders of Company RSUs and Company Options will receive a payment
from the Company or the Surviving Corporation (or applicable Subsidiary
employer), through its payroll system or payroll provider, of all amounts
required to be paid to such holders in respect of Company RSUs or Company
Options that are cancelled and converted pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_, or
_Section 2.8(b)_ , as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
payment owed to a holder of Company RSUs or Company Options pursuant to
_Section 2.8(a)_, or _Section 2.8(b)_ , as applicable, cannot be made through
the Company's or the Surviving Corporation's payroll system or payroll
provider, then the Surviving Corporation will issue a check for the net
amount of such payment to such holder, which check will be sent by overnight
courier to such holder promptly, but in no event later than, two Business
Days following the first regularly scheduled payroll date that is at least
five Business Days after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to
the extent that any such amounts relate to a Company RSU that is
nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay such amounts at the earliest time permitted
under the terms of the applicable agreement, plan or arrangement relating to
such Company RSU that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of
the Code.

  



  

(d)   _Further Actions_. The Company will take all action necessary
to effect the cancellation of Company RSUs and Company Options upon the
Effective Time and to give effect to this _Section 2.8_ (including the
satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the
Exchange Act). The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that
following the Effective Time no participant in any Company Stock Plan or
other Employee Plan will have any right thereto to acquire any
equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries.

  



  

2.9 _  _ _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a)   _Paying Agent_. No less than 10 Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, (i) Parent and the Company shall jointly select a nationally
recognized bank or trust company to act as the paying agent for the Merger
(the "Paying Agent"); and (ii) Parent shall enter into a paying agent
agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company,
with such Paying Agent.

  



  

(b)   _Payment Fund_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall
irrevocably deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares
of Class A Common Stock pursuant to  _Section 2.7_, an amount in cash equal
to the aggregate consideration to which such holders of Class A Common Stock
become entitled pursuant to _Section 2.7_. Until disbursed in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested
by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in
(i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation,
respectively; (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$10,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank
that are then publicly available) or (iv) mutual funds investing in one or
more of any such assets (such cash and any proceeds thereon, the "Payment
Fund"). To the extent that (A) there are any losses with respect to any
investments of the Payment Fund; (B) the Payment Fund diminishes for any
reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to promptly pay the cash
amounts contemplated by _Section 2.7_; or (C) all or any portion of the
Payment Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Paying Agent on behalf of
Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by _Section 2.7_ for
any reason, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Payment Fund so as to
ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times fully available for distribution
and maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make the
payments contemplated by _Section 2.7_. Any income from investment of the
Payment Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
Parent directs. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than
the payment to holders of Class A Common Stock as contemplated by _Section
2.7_.

  



  

   

 | -22-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c)   _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time
(and in any event within three Business Days), Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than holders of Owned
Company Shares) of (i) a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock
(other than Owned Company Shares) (the "Certificates" (if any)); or (ii)
uncertificated shares of Class A Common Stock that represented outstanding
shares of Class A Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares) (the
"Uncertificated Shares") (A) in the case of Certificates, a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent); and (B) in the case of
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares, instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the
Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.7_. Upon
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Class A
Common Stock represented by each such Certificate; by (y) the Per Share
Price, subject to applicable withholding for any required Taxes pursuant to
_Section 2.12,_ and the Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be
cancelled. Upon receipt of an "agent's message" by the Paying Agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the
holders of such Uncertificated Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1)
the aggregate number of shares of Class A Common Stock represented by such
holder's transferred Uncertificated Shares; by (2) the Per Share Price,
subject to applicable withholding for any required Taxes pursuant to
_Section 2.12_ , and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered
will be cancelled. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates and
transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms
and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid
or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares on the Per Share Price payable upon the surrender of such
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.9(c)_.
Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will
be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to
receive the Per Share Price, without interest thereon, payable in respect
thereof pursuant to _Section 2.7_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, no holder of Uncertificated Shares will be required to
provide a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Paying Agent in order to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to _Section 2.7_.

  



  

   

 | -23-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d)   _DTC Payment_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the
Depository Trust Company ("DTC") with the objective that the Paying Agent
shall transmit to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the
Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, equal to (A) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock
(other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) held of
record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time;
multiplied by (B) the Per Share Price.

  



  

(e)   _Transfers of Ownership_. If a transfer of ownership of shares
of Class A Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or
ledger of the Company, or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name other
than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange
therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company,
the Per Share Price may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock
transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the
Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by
Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share
Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or
established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent or the Paying Agent that
such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable.

  



  

(f)   _Distribution of Payment Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the
Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time
will be delivered to Parent (or the Surviving Corporation as directed by
Parent) upon demand, and any holders of shares of Class A Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Class A Common Stock for
exchange pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ will thereafter look for payment of
the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Class A Common Stock
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), as general creditors
thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders may be
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.7_. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
holders of any such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares immediately prior to
the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property
of, any Governmental Authority, will, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any
claims or interest of any such holders (and their successors, assigns or
personal representatives) previously entitled thereto.

  



  

2.10 _  _ _No Further Ownership Rights in Class A Common Stock_. From
and after the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Class A Common Stock will no
longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled, retired and cease
to exist; and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares
theretofore representing any shares of Class A Common Stock will cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per
Share Price payable therefor in accordance with _Section 2.7_, or in the
case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)_.
The Per Share Price paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_
will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to such shares of Class A Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time,
there will be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Class A Common Stock that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to
reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they will (subject to compliance with the payment procedures of
_Section 2.9(c)_) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
II_.

2.11 _  _ _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that
any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant
to _Section 2.7_. Parent or the Paying Agent may, in its
reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per
Share Price, require the owners of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such reasonable amount as it may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates

Financing Letters and the terms of the Financing have not been amended or
modified, except as permitted by the Financing Letters and disclosed in
writing to the Company; (ii) no such amendment or modification is
contemplated, except as contemplated by the Financing Letters; and (iii) the
respective commitments contained in the Financing Letters have not been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect by Parent, Merger Sub and
any of their respective Affiliates, or to the knowledge of Parent, Merger Sub
and any of their respective Affiliates, any other party thereto, and no such
withdrawal, termination or rescission is contemplated by Parent, Merger Sub
and any of their respective Affiliates, or to the knowledge of Parent, Merger
Sub and any of their respective Affiliates, by any other party thereto. As of
the date of this Agreement, there are no other Contracts, side letters or
arrangements to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates is a party relating to the Financing which have not
been disclosed to the Company and that could (A) affect the conditionality or
availability of the Financing or reduce the aggregate principal amount of the
Financing below the amount required to pay the Required Amount (as defined
below) on the Closing Date, (B) materially delay or prevent the Closing, (C)
make the funding of the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing less likely to
occur or (D) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Letters.

  



  

(c)   _Sufficiency of Financing_. Assuming, (A) the Financing is
funded in accordance with the Financing Letters, (B) the accuracy in all
material respects of the Company's representations and warranties set forth in
_Article III_ of this Agreement and (C) the performance by the Company of the
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the aggregate
proceeds contemplated to be provided by the Financing Letters will be
sufficient to (i) make all payments contemplated by this Agreement (including
the payment of all amounts payable pursuant to _Article II_ in connection with
or as a result of the Merger); (ii) repay, prepay or discharge (after giving
effect to the Merger) the principal of, and interest on, certain outstanding
Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as specified in the
Debt Commitment Letters; and (iii) pay all fees and expenses required to be
paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, including those
required to be paid at the Closing by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with the Merger and the Financing (the "Required Amount").

  



  

(d)   _Validity_. The Financing Letters (in the forms delivered
by Parent to the Company) are in full force and effect with respect to, and
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of, Parent, Merger Sub
and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto (including, with
respect to the Equity Commitment Letter, Guarantors), as applicable,
enforceable against Parent, Merger Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent, the
other parties thereto, as applicable, in accordance with their terms,
except as such enforceability (i) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting or
relating to creditors' rights generally; and (ii) is subject to general
principles of equity. Other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Letters, there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies (express or
implied) related to the funding of the full proceeds of the Financing
pursuant to any agreement relating to the Financing to which
Guarantors, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates is a
party. Neither Parent, nor to the knowledge of Parent, any of the other
parties thereto, is in violation or breach of any of the terms or conditions
set forth in the Financing Letters, and as of the date of this Agreement, to
the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred that, with or without notice or
lapse of time or both, would, or would reasonably be expected to, (A)
constitute a default, breach or failure to satisfy a condition precedent
set forth in the Financing Letters, or (B) result in any portion of the
Financing being unavailable on the Closing Date, assuming the conditions to
the Financing are satisfied. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no
reason to believe that (1) it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any
term or condition set forth in the Financing Letters or this Agreement to the
funding of the full amount of the Financing to be satisfied by it, or (2) the
full amount of the Financing will not be available on the Closing Date in
order to fund the Transactions. No party to any Financing Letter has notified
Parent of its intention to terminate any of the commitments set forth in the
Financing Letters or not to provide the Financing, and no termination of any
commitment set forth in the Financing Letters is contemplated by Parent. As
of the date of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid, or
caused to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees and amounts that are due
and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the terms
of the Financing Letters, and Parent and Merger Sub shall, directly or
indirectly, continue to pay in full any such fees and amounts required to be
paid as and when they become due and payable on or prior to the Closing Date.

Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates has entered into any
Contract, arrangement or understanding prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any
bank, investment bank or other potential provider of debt or equity financing
from providing or seeking to provide debt or equity financing or financial

any of its Subsidiaries (a) relating to (i) this Agreement or the
Transactions; (ii) the Company; or (iii) the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries, businesses or operations (including as to continuing
employment) from and after the Effective Time; or (b) pursuant to which (i)
any holder of Class A Common Stock would be entitled to receive consideration
of a different amount or nature than the Per Share Price in respect of such
holder's shares of Class A Common Stock; (ii) any holder of Class A Common
Stock has agreed to approve this Agreement or vote against any Superior
Proposal; or (iii) any Person other than Guarantors have agreed to provide,
directly or indirectly, equity investment to Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company to finance any portion of the Merger, in each case other than
pursuant to the Voting Agreement.

  



  

4.14 _  _ _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time and immediately after
giving effect to the Merger (including the payment of all amounts payable
pursuant to _Article II_ in connection with or as a result of the Merger and
all related fees and expenses of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries in connection therewith), assuming the accuracy and
completeness of the representations and warranties of the Company in _Article
III_ , (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of each of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will, as a whole, exceed (i)
the value of all liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and such
Subsidiaries, including contingent and other liabilities; and (ii) the amount
that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of each of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries on their existing debts (including
contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured; (b) each of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will not have an unreasonably
small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it

Corporation and its Subsidiaries will be able to pay its liabilities,
including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.

provision that prohibits or purports to prohibit a proposal being made to the
Company Board; _provided_ that the Company shall be permitted on a
confidential basis to release or waive any standstill obligation solely to
the extent necessary to permit the Person otherwise covered by such standstill
obligation to submit an Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board on a
confidential basis and solely to the extent that the failure to grant such
release or waiver would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
Company Board's fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under
applicable Law. Any violation or breach of the restrictions or obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.3_  by any Affiliate of the Company or any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, acting

engage in discussions or negotiations with, furnish any non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or afford
access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-
public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to any Person
or its Representatives that has made, renewed or delivered to the Company a
_bona_ fide written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that
did not result from a breach of the terms of this _Section 5.3_ if the
Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that (A) such Acquisition
Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to
lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to take the actions set forth
in this _Section 5.3(c)_  above with respect to such Acquisition Proposal
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company's
stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that, subject to
applicable Law, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours)
make available to Parent any material non-public information concerning the
Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to any such Person or its
Representatives pursuant to this _Section 5.3(c)_ that was not previously
made available to Parent.

an Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Except as permitted by _Section

Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent in any material respect;

Acquisition Proposal; (C) take or fail to take any formal action or make or
fail to make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a
tender or exchange offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a
"stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or
any substantially similar communication) (it being understood that the
Company Board may refrain from taking a position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal until the close of business on the 5th Business Day
after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such
Acquisition Proposal without such action being considered a violation of this
_Section 5.3_); (D) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation within five Business Days after its receipt of a written
request by Parent to provide such affirmation ( _provided_ , that such
reaffirmation may include such additional disclosures as would reasonably be
necessary to satisfy the fiduciary duties of the Company Board and comply
with applicable Law so long as such disclosure does not have the substantive
effect of withdrawing or modifying in a manner adverse to Parent the Company
Board Recommendation) or (E) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation
in the Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses (A) through (E), a
"Company Board Recommendation Change"); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, for
the avoidance of doubt, the delivery by the Company of any notice contemplated
by _Section 5.3(e)(i)(3)_ or _Section 5.3(e)(ii)(1)_ (and the public
announcement thereof) will not constitute a Company Board Recommendation
Change; or

  



  

(ii)  authorize, resolve to allow, cause or permit, or publicly
announce an intention to approve or recommend that, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

  



  

(e)   _Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into
Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval:

  



  

(i)  if the Company has received a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of the terms of this
_Section 5.3_ and that the Company Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel)
constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may (A) effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to such Acquisition Proposal
or (B) authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement to enter into
an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board shall not take any
action described in the foregoing clauses (A) and (B) unless:

  



  

(1)  the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to
applicable Law;

  



  

(2)  the Company has complied in all material respects with its
obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal;

Parent at least four Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period") to the
effect that the Company Board has (A) received a Superior Proposal and (B)
intends to take the actions described in clauses (A) or (B) of Section
_5.3(e)(i)_ absent any revision to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, which notice will specify the basis for such actions,
including the identity of the Person or Group making such
Acquisition Proposal, the terms thereof (other than immaterial terms) and
copies of all relevant documents (other than immaterial documents) relating
to such Acquisition Proposal including any proposed definitive transaction
agreements with the Person making such Superior Proposal and; and (ii) prior
to taking such actions described in clauses (A) or (B) of _Section 5.3(e)(i)_
, the Company and its Representatives, during the Notice Period, must have
negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent
that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that the Company Board would no longer
determine that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in
response to such Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law (and would cause such Superior
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal), and must have kept
Parent reasonably informed in all material respects of any
material developments with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal (and any
subsequent amendments or modifications thereto) and delivered copies of
revised or newly received documents to Parent, in each case, as soon as is
reasonably practicable and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of
receipt, provision or occurrence thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event of any material revisions to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company
shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply
with the requirements of this _Section 5.3(e)(i)(3)_ with respect to such
new written notice (it being understood that the "Notice Period" in respect
of such new written notice will be three Business Days); and

  



  

(4)  in the event of any termination of this Agreement in order
to cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal,
the Company shall have validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.1(h)_, including paying (or causing to be paid) the Company
Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 8.3(b)(iii)_.

  



  

(ii)  other than in connection with a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change of the kind set forth in clause (A), (D)
or (E) of the definition thereof in response to an Intervening Event if the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board shall not effect such a
Company Board Recommendation Change unless:

  



  

(1)  the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at
least four Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board has
(A) so determined and (B) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change pursuant to this _Section 5.3(e)(ii)_, which notice will specify the
applicable Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and

  



  

   

-61-

 



    



  

(2)  prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation
Change, the Company and its Representatives, during such three Business Day
period, must have negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith
(to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Company Board would
no longer determine that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation
Change in response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law, and must have kept Parent
reasonably informed in all material respects of any material developments
with respect to any such Intervening Event and delivered copies of revised or
newly received documents relating to such Intervening Event to Parent, in
each case, as soon as is reasonably practicable and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours of receipt, provision or occurrence thereof.

  



  

(f)   _Notice_. From the date hereof until the earlier to occur
of the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the
Effective Time, the Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within 24
hours) notify Parent if any offers or proposals with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal are received by, any non-public information is requested
from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives. Such notice must
include the identity of each Person from whom the Company received any such
offer or proposal with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, any written terms
and conditions or proposal provided (including financing commitments, and, in
the case of any such offer or proposal not made in writing, a written summary
of the material terms and conditions of such offers or proposals), together
with copies of any other non-public information that has been provided by or
on behalf of the Company to such Person that has not previously been provided
to Parent. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a
prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such offers or proposals
(including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or
negotiations. No later than 24 hours after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the
Company shall notify Parent in writing of the identity of each Excluded Party
as of such time.

  



  

(g)   _Certain Disclosures_. Nothing in this Agreement will
prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to
the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, including making a "stop, look and listen" communication to the
Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any similar communication); (ii) complying with Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; (iii) informing any Person
of the existence of the provisions contained in this _Section 5.3_; (iv)
complying with the Company's disclosure obligations under United States
federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal if, in the good
faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law and such disclosure is otherwise required under
applicable Law; or (v) making any disclosure to the Company
Stockholders (including regarding the business, financial condition or
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries) that the
Company Board has determined to make in good faith, it being understood that,
in the case of each of clauses (i) through (v), any such statement or
disclosure made by the Company Board must be subject to and in compliance in
all respects with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In addition, it
is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement, a factually
accurate public statement by the Company or the Company Board that describes
the Company's receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms of such Acquisition
Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto will not be
deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change for so long as such
disclosure does not have the substantive effect of withdrawing or modifying
in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board Recommendation. For the
avoidance of doubt, the fact that a disclosure or other action may be deemed
permissible by virtue of this _Section 5.3(g)_ does not in and of itself mean
that such disclosure or other action does not constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change.

5.4 _  _ _No Control of the Other Party 's Business_. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that the restrictions set forth in this
Agreement are not intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or
the Company, on the other hand, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the business or operations of the other at any time prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company will exercise, consistent with the terms, conditions
and restrictions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over
their own business and operations.

Governmental Authority with another Party on an "outside counsel" only basis,

(c)   _Other Actions_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees
that, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, it shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to take any actions
that would reasonably be expected to result in any delay in obtaining, or to
result in the failure to obtain, any FCC Consents, PSC Consents, or Local

or arrangements for an acquisition (by stock purchase, merger, consolidation,
purchase of assets, license or otherwise) of any ownership interest, assets or
rights of any Person; _provided_  that the foregoing shall not prohibit or

information and facilities relating to the goods and services the Company or
its Subsidiaries provides directly or indirectly to the governments of the
United States, (x) FCC-imposed conditions addressing national security, law
enforcement, or public safety concerns of the Telecom Committee that are
generally consistent with FCC-imposed conditions addressing such concerns for
a current or prior Oak Hill Related Entity and do not substantially interfere
with the ability of Parent or Oak Hill Capital Partners V (Onshore), L.P. to
appoint or select a majority of the Company's board members, (y) obligations
to regularly report to Governmental Authorities and to grant Governmental
Authorities access to the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
(z) limitations and restrictions on the sourcing of new equipment from
manufacturers in particular countries; and (iv) otherwise taking or
committing to take actions that after the Effective Time would limit Parent
or any of its Affiliates' ability to retain one or more of the businesses,
product lines, assets or operations of Parent or any of its Affiliates or the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, in each case, to the extent necessary to
obtain any such clearance, resolve any such objections or avoid or eliminate
any such impediments (the actions described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and
(iv)), the "Remedy Actions"); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
effectiveness of any such Remedy Action shall be conditioned upon the Closing;
_provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall permit the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries (without the prior written consent of
Parent) or require Parent or its Affiliates to take or refrain from taking,
or agree to take or refrain from taking, any Remedy Action or Remedy Actions
that, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely to have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition, business or results of
operation of Parent and its Affiliates (taken as a whole) or a Company
Material Adverse Effect (a "Burdensome Condition"). Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 6.2_ shall
require Parent to cause any Oak Hill Related Entity to take, or refrain from
taking, any Remedy Action other than preparing and filing documentation as
may be required for (and responding to any inquiries or information requests
from any Governmental Entity in connection with) receipt of the FCC Consents,
PSC Consents or Local Consents required in connection with the
Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt (A) without limiting the foregoing,
no actions taken pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ shall affect any
representation or warranty of the Company under this Agreement or any
condition under _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_  to the obligation of Parent
and Merger Sub to effect the Merger and (B) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 6.2_ or any other provision of this Agreement,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall sell, divest, dispose
of or enter into any other arrangements or take any other Remedy Action with
respect to their businesses, product lines, assets or operations pursuant to
this _Section 6.2_ or any other provision of this Agreement, unless such
Remedy Action (x) is conditioned in all respects upon the consummation of the
Merger and will not be effective for any purpose until after the Effective
Time and (y) does not constitute a Burdensome Condition.

and in any event within twenty (25) calendar days following the date of this
Agreement, the Company (with the assistance and cooperation of Parent and
Merger Sub as reasonably requested by the Company) shall prepare and file
with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement (as amended or supplemented, the
"Proxy Statement") relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject to
_Section 5.3_, the Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement. Subject to applicable Law, the Company (i) may not file
the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing with the SEC without
providing Parent and its counsel, to the extent practicable, a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, (ii) shall consider in
good faith all comments thereon reasonably proposed by Parent and (iii) shall
not file or mail the Proxy Statement or Other Required Company Filing without

efforts to cause the Company Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company
Filing and any amendments and supplements thereto to comply in all material
respects with all legal requirements applicable thereto.

  



  

(b)   _Other Required Company Filings_. If the Company
determines that it is required to file any document other than the Proxy
Statement with the SEC in connection with the Merger pursuant to applicable
Law (such document, as amended or supplemented, an "Other Required Company
Filing"), then the Company (with the assistance and cooperation of Parent and
Merger Sub as reasonably requested by the Company) or Parent (as applicable)
shall promptly prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) such
Other Required Company Filing with the SEC.

  



  

(c)   _Furnishing Information_. Each of the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall furnish all
information concerning it and its Affiliates, if applicable, as the other
Party may reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing
with the SEC of the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing. If
at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting any information relating
to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates should be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or
Merger Sub, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, as the
case may be, so that such filing would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, then the Party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement to such filing describing such
information shall be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC by the
appropriate Party and, to the extent required by applicable Law or the SEC or
its staff, disseminated to the Company Stockholders.

  



  

(d)   _Notices_. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall advise the other, promptly after
receiving notice thereof, of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff
for (i) any amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement or any Other
Required Company Filing, as the case may be; (ii) any receipt of comments from
the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company
Filing, as the case may be; or (iii) any receipt of a request by the SEC or
its staff for additional information in connection therewith, and in each case
shall provide the other with all copies of all correspondence with respect to
the Proxy Statement between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to resolve as promptly as reasonably practicable any comments from the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing.

to, as promptly as practicable but no later than the later of (i) as
applicable, (A) the third (3rd) Business Day following receipt of
confirmation from the SEC that it has completed its review of, the Proxy
Statement, or, (B) if the SEC has either (1) not affirmatively notified the
Company prior to the end of the tenth (10th) calendar day after filing the
preliminary Proxy Statement that the SEC will or will not be reviewing the
Proxy Statement or (2) affirmatively notified the Company prior to the end of
the tenth (10th) calendar day after filing the preliminary Proxy Statement
that the SEC will not be reviewing the Proxy Statement, the tenth (10th)
calendar day after filing the preliminary Proxy Statement and (ii) the No-
Shop Period Start Date, cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the Company Stockholders; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company shall not be required to cause the definitive Proxy
Statement to be filed with the SEC or disseminated to the Company
Stockholders if and for so long as the Company is participating in
discussions or negotiations with an Excluded Party (but only for so long as
such Person is an Excluded Party) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal not
in violation of _Section 5.3_ ; _provided_ , _further_ , that such period to
postpone the filing and dissemination of the definitive Proxy Statement shall
terminate (and in such case the Company shall be required to file and
disseminate the definitive Proxy Statement) on the earlier of (A) the date
that the Company is no longer participating in negotiations with an Excluded
Party with respect to such an Acquisition Proposal and (B) the Cut-Off Date.

  



  

6.4 _  _ _Company Stockholder Meeting_.

  



  

(a)   _Call of Company Stockholder Meeting_. Unless this
Agreement has been terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_ , and subject to
fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, the Company shall, no later than
the later of (i) as applicable, (A) the third (3rd) Business Day following
receipt of confirmation from the SEC that it has completed its review of, the
Proxy Statement or, (B) if the SEC has either (1) not affirmatively notified
the Company prior to the end of the tenth (10th) calendar day after filing
the preliminary Proxy Statement that the SEC will or will not be reviewing the
Proxy Statement or (2) affirmatively notified the Company prior to the end of
the tenth (10th) calendar day after filing the preliminary Proxy Statement
that the SEC will not be reviewing the Proxy Statement, the tenth (10th)
calendar day after filing the preliminary Proxy Statement, and (ii) the No-
Shop Period Start Date, take all actions necessary or reasonably required in
accordance with the DGCL, the Charter, the Bylaws and the rules and
regulations of the SEC and NASDAQ to establish (and provide written notice to
Parent of) a record date for, duly call and give notice of a meeting of its
stockholders (the "Company Stockholder Meeting") and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting for the
purpose of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval within thirty (30)
calendar days of the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company
Stockholders;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
required to establish a record date for, duly call or give notice of the
Company Stockholder Meeting if and for so long as the Company is participating
in discussions or negotiations with an Excluded Party (but only for so long
as such Person is an Excluded Party) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
not in violation of _Section 5.3_ ; _provided_ , _further_ , that such period
to postpone the time to establish a record date for, duly call and
give notice of the Company Stockholder Meeting shall terminate (and in such
case the Company shall be required to establish a record date for, duly call
and give notice of the Company Stockholder Meeting) on the earlier of (A) the
date that the Company is no longer participating in negotiations with an
Excluded Party with respect to such an Acquisition Proposal and (B) the Cut-
Off Date. Subject to _Section 5.3_ and unless there has been a Company Board
Recommendation Change, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit proxies to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval.

  



  

   

-68-

 



    



  

(b)   _Adjournment of Company Stockholder Meeting_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing
will prevent the Company from postponing or adjourning the Company
Stockholder Meeting (i) if there are holders of an insufficient number shares
of Class A Common Stock present or represented by proxy at the Company
Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder
Meeting; (ii) to allow additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the
Requisite Stockholder Approval; (iii) if the Company is required to postpone
or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable Law or a
request from the SEC or its staff; or (iv) if the Company Board has
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
it is necessary or appropriate to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder
Meeting, including in order to give the Company Stockholders sufficient time
to evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company has sent to the
Company Stockholders or otherwise made available to the Company Stockholders
(including in connection with any Company Board Recommendation Change); 
_provided_ that in no event will the Company adjourn the meeting for more than
three occasions for no more than ten Business Days per occasion without the
prior written consent of Parent.

  



  

6.5 _  _ _Financing_.

  



  

(a)   _No Amendments to Financing Letters_. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Financing Letters, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and Guarantors shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company, permit or grant any withdrawal, rescindment, amendment, replacement,
supplement, consent or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy pursuant to, the Financing Letters or any definitive
agreement relating to the Financing if such withdrawal, rescindment,
amendment, replacement, supplement, consent, modification or waiver would, or
would reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the
Financing to an amount less than the Required Amount, including by changing
the amount of the fees to be paid or the original issue discount of the Debt
Financing; (ii) impose new or additional conditions or other terms or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Financing (including expanding the information required to be provided by the
Company) or any other terms to the Financing in a manner that would reasonably
be expected to (A) delay or prevent the Closing; or (B) make the timely
funding of the Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining
the Financing, less likely to occur in any respect; or (iii) adversely impact
the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, to enforce
its rights against the other parties to the Financing Letters or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto. Parent shall promptly furnish to
the Company a true and complete copy of any amendment, replacement,
supplement, modification, consent or waiver relating to the Financing Letters
or any definitive agreements relating to the Financing. Any reference in this
Agreement to (1) the "Financing" will include the financing contemplated by
the Financing Letters as amended or modified and (2) "Equity Commitment
Letter," "Debt Commitment Letters" or "Financing Letters" will include such
documents as amended or modified. Parent shall not release or consent to the
termination of any individual lender under the Debt Commitment Letters,
except for (x) assignments and replacements of an individual lender under the
terms of, and only in connection with, the syndication of the Debt Financing
under the Debt Commitment Letters; or (y) replacements of the Debt Commitment
Letters with alternative financing commitments pursuant to _Section 6.5(d)_.

conditions of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, use their respective reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper and advisable to arrange, consummate and obtain
the Financing on a timely basis, but in any event no later than the Closing
Date, on the terms and conditions (including, to the extent required, the
full exercise of any "flex" provisions in any Fee Letter) described in the
Financing Letters and any related Fee Letter, including using its reasonable
best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Letters in accordance
with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof; (ii) negotiate, enter
into, execute and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters and any related Fee

related Fee Letter; (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions that are
within its control and applicable to Parent and Merger Sub contained in the
(A) Debt Commitment Letters, any related Fee Letter and such definitive
agreements related thereto and (B) Equity Commitment Letter on or prior to
the Closing Date; (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing,
including causing the Financing Sources to fund the Financing at the Closing;

pay, or cause to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees arising pursuant
to the Financing Letters as and when they become due.

  



  

(c)   _Information_. Parent shall (i) keep the Company informed
on a current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Financing and (ii) upon request provide the Company with drafts of
all definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing in advance of

definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company
prompt notice in writing (but in any event within two Business Days after the

material breach), material default (or any event or circumstance that, with
notice or lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to
any material breach or default), cancellation, termination or repudiation by
any party to the Financing Letters or definitive agreements related to the
Financing; (B) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any oral or written
notice or communication from any Financing Source with respect to any (1)
actual or threatened material breach, default, cancellation, termination or
repudiation (or notice or communication from Financing Sources to Parent or
Merger Sub of any such actual or threatened material breach, default,
cancellation, termination or repudiation received by Parent or Merger Sub) by
any party to the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements related to the
Financing of any provisions of the Financing Letters or such definitive
agreements; or (2) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements related to the
Financing; (C) if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub at any time believes
that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
necessary to fund the Required Amount on the terms, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements
related to the Financing; and (D) of the occurrence of an event or
development that could reasonably be expected to adversely impact the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
in an amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions. Parent and Merger Sub
shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to
any of the circumstances referred to in the previous sentence as promptly as
reasonably practicable (but in any event within two Business Days) after the
date that the Company delivers a written request therefor to Parent; provided
that none of Parent or Merger Sub shall be required to disclose or provide
any such information, the disclosure of which, in the judgement of Parent upon
advice of outside counsel, is subject to attorney client privilege. Parent
and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause the Financing Sources to, provide the
Company and its Representatives with such access to the Financing Sources as
the Company and its Representatives may reasonably request for the purpose of
allowing the Company and its Representatives to understand the status of
Parent and Merger Sub's efforts to arrange the Financing;

(d)   _Alternate Debt Financing_. If any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable, or Parent becomes aware of any event or
circumstance that makes any portion of the Debt Financing unavailable, on the
terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions in any Fee Letter)
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters and related Fee Letter, Parent and
Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company in writing (but in any event
within two Business Days after the discovery thereof) and Parent and Merger
Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, (i) arrange and obtain
the Debt Financing or such portion of the Debt Financing from the same or
alternative sources in an amount sufficient to fund the Required Amount (A)
on terms and conditions not materially less favorable in the aggregate to
Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and
any related Fee Letter, (B) containing conditions to draw, conditions to
Closing and other terms that would reasonably be expected to affect the
availability thereof that (1) are not more onerous than those conditions and
terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and any related Fee Letter, (2)
would not reasonably be expected to delay the Closing or make the Closing
materially less likely to occur, and (3) in an amount at least equal to the
Required Amount (the "Alternate Debt Financing"); and (ii) obtain one or more
new financing commitment letters with respect to such Alternate Debt
Financing (the "New Debt Commitment Letters"), which new letters will replace
the existing Debt Commitment Letters in whole or in part. Parent shall
promptly provide a copy of any New Debt Commitment Letters (and any fee
letter in connection therewith or other agreements related thereto) to the
Company. In the event that any New Debt Commitment Letters are obtained, (A)
any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing Letters" or the "Debt
Commitment Letters" will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters to
the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in
question and any New Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect; and
(B) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing" or the "Debt
Financing" means the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters as modified pursuant to the foregoing.

  



  

(e)   _No Financing Condition_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with this _Section 6.5_  shall not
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of their respective obligations to consummate the
Transactions whether or not the Financing is available, and Parent and Merger
Sub each acknowledge and agree that none of obtaining the Financing or any
permitted alternative financing, the completion of any issuance of securities
contemplated by the Financing or the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries having or maintaining any available cash balances subject to the
applicable conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ is a
condition to the Closing.

(x)  taking all reasonable actions necessary to establish bank

(b)   _Obligations of the Company_. Nothing in this _Section 6.6_
will require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) waive or amend any
terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses
prior to the Effective Time for which it has not received prior reimbursement
or is not otherwise indemnified by or on behalf of Parent; (ii) cause
any condition set forth in _Article VII_ to fail to be satisfied; (iii) enter
into any definitive agreement the effectiveness of which is not conditioned
upon the Closing; (iv) give any indemnities that are effective prior to the
Effective Time; or (v) take any action that, in the good faith determination
of the Company, would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, breach any confidentiality obligations or
create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. In addition, no action, liability or
obligation of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document
or instrument relating to the Debt Financing will be effective until the
Effective Time, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be
required to take any action pursuant to any certificate, agreement,
arrangement, document or instrument that is not contingent on the occurrence
of the Closing or that must be effective prior to the Effective Time. Nothing
in this  _Section 6.6_ will require (A) any Representative of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate or opinion or take any
other action under this _Section 6.6_ that could reasonably be expected to
result in personal liability to such Representative; (B) the Company Board
(or a committee thereof) to approve any financing or Contracts
related thereto prior to the Effective Time; or (C) the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers or employees to execute,
deliver or enter into, or perform any agreement, document or instrument,

-73-

 



    



  

(c)   _Use of Logos_. The Company hereby consents to the use of
its and its Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Debt Financing so long
as such logos (i) are used solely in a manner that is not intended to, or
reasonably likely to, harm or disparage the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; and (ii) are used solely in connection with a description of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, its or their respective businesses
and products or the Transactions.

information provided by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives pursuant to this Agreement shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

(e)   _Reimbursement_. Promptly upon request by the Company,
Parent shall reimburse the Company for any reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys'
fees) incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives in connection with the cooperation or obligations of the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives contemplated
by this _Section 6.6_.

  



  

(f)   _Indemnification_. The Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives shall be indemnified and held harmless by
Parent and Merger Sub from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees), interest,
awards, judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement suffered or
incurred by them in connection with their cooperation in arranging the Debt
Financing pursuant to this Agreement or the provision of information (other
than information provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries) utilized in
connection therewith, in each case other than to the extent any of
the foregoing was suffered or incurred as a result of the bad faith, Fraud,
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective representatives. Parent's obligations
pursuant to _Section 6.6(e)_ and this _Section 6.6(f)_ are referred to
collectively as the "Reimbursement Obligations."

  



  

6.7 _  _ _Anti-Takeover Laws_. The Company, the Company Board
(or a committee thereof) and Parent shall (a) take all reasonable actions
within their power to ensure that no "anti-takeover" statute or similar
statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Transactions and (b) if
any "anti-takeover" statute or similar statute or regulation becomes
applicable to the Transactions, take all reasonable actions within their power
to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such statute or regulation on the Transactions.

6.8 _ _ _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier
to occur of the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article
VIII_ and the Effective Time, the Company shall afford Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access, consistent with applicable Law, during
normal business hours, upon reasonable advance request provided in writing to
the General Counsel of the Company, or another Person designated in writing by
the Company, to the properties, books and records and personnel of the
Company, except that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to
any documents or information to the extent that (a) any applicable Law or
Contract requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to
such documents or information; (b) access to such documents or information
would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such documents or
information ( _provided_ that the Company has reasonably cooperated with
Parent to permit such access on a basis that does not risk waiving such
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege); (c) access to a Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default
pursuant to, or give a third Person the right terminate or accelerate the
rights pursuant to, such Contract ( _provided_ that the Company has
reasonably cooperated with Parent to permit such access on a basis that does
not give rise to any such violation, default, termination or acceleration);
(d) access would result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets (including any
source code or object code) of the Company, any of the Subsidiaries of the
Company or any third Persons; or (e) such documents or information are
reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal Proceeding between the Company and
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the other
hand. Nothing in this _Section 6.8_ will be construed to require the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to prepare
any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information. Any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section
6.8_ shall be conducted in a manner that (i) does not unreasonably interfere
with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
otherwise result in any significant interference with the prompt and timely
discharge by Representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of
their normal duties or (ii) create a material risk of damage or destruction to
any property or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Any access to the
properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject to the
Company's reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and will
not include the right to collect any air, soil, surface water,
groundwater, or vapor samples or to perform any invasive or destructive
environmental or subsurface investigation(s), including any "Phase II"
environmental site assessment or similar work. The terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement will apply to any information obtained by Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives in connection with any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section
6.8_.

  



  

6.9 _ _ _Section 16(b) Exemption_. Prior to the Effective Time,

6.10 _ _ _Directors ' and Officers' Exculpation, Indemnification and
Insurance_.

  



  

(a) _Indemnified Persons_. The Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements
between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one
hand, and any of their respective current or former directors, officers,
employees or agents (and any person who becomes a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time), on the other hand (each, together with such Person's heirs, executors
and administrators, an "Indemnified Person" and, collectively, the
"Indemnified Persons") that have been made available to Parent ("Existing
Indemnification Agreements"). In addition, during the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the Organizational
Documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of
expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation
and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the
Organizational Documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company, as of the date
of this Agreement. During such six-year period, such provisions may not be
repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by
applicable Law or agreement pursuant to _Section 6.10(e)_ below.

  



  

(b) _Indemnification Obligation_. Without limiting the generality
of the provisions of _Section 6.10(a)_, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the same extent such Persons are
indemnified as of the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Organizational
Documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Existing
Indemnification Agreements, each Indemnified Person from and against any
costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys' fees and
investigation expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in
connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, whenever asserted, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding
arises, directly or indirectly, out of, or pertains, directly or indirectly,
to, (i) the fact that an Indemnified Person is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or Affiliate; (ii) any
action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified
Person's capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates, or taken at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary or Affiliate, including in connection with serving
at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary or Affiliate as a director,
officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (including
any employee benefit plan), regardless of whether such action or omission, or
alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time;
and (iii) the Transactions, as well as any actions taken by the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub with respect thereto (including any disposition of assets
of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that is alleged to
have rendered the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
insolvent), except that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice
asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.10(b)_,
then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the
event of any such Legal Proceeding, the Surviving Corporation shall advance
reasonable fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as
incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal Proceeding;
_provided_ that the applicable Indemnified Person provides an undertaking to
repay such advance if it is ultimately determined by a final non-appealable
order of a court of competent jurisdiction that an Indemnified Person is not
entitled to indemnification under this _Section 6.10(b) _ or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation nor any of their respective Affiliates from after
the Effective Time will settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry
of any judgment with respect to any claim against the Company or Surviving
Corporation in a Legal Proceeding to which an Indemnified Person is a party
(and for which indemnification is sought by such Indemnified Person hereunder)
unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination either (x) is a
settlement in which the settlement consideration is limited to additional
disclosures, or monetary damages (including attorneys' fees) for which
Indemnified Persons are not responsible, (y) includes a release of such
Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding or
(z) is consented to by the Indemnified Persons that are parties to the Legal
Proceeding. Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the
conduct of any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable
standard will be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving
Corporation (which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified
Person), the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the
Surviving Corporation.

  



  

   

-76-

 



    



  

(c) _D andO Insurance_. During the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain in effect the Company's current directors' and
officers' liability insurance ("DandO Insurance") in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including
with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that
are substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the
aggregate those of the DandO Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant
to this _Section 6.10(c)_, the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated
to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company
for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the
"Maximum Annual Premium"). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Company's current directors' and
officers' liability insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective Time, in lieu
of the foregoing, the Company may, with the prior written consent of Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),
purchase a prepaid "tail" policy with respect to the DandO Insurance from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current directors' and officers' liability insurance carrier so long as the
annual cost for such "tail" policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual
Premium. If the Company elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and
effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as such
"tail" policy is in full force and effect. If the Company is unable to obtain
the "tail" policy and Parent or the Surviving Corporation are unable to
obtain the insurance described in this _Section 6.10(c)_ , as applicable, for
an amount less than or equal to the Maximum Annual Premium, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to instead obtain as much comparable insurance
as possible for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Annual Premium.

  



  

   

-77-

 



    



  

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidate with or
merge into any other Person and not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfer or convey all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will
assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set
forth in this _Section 6.10_.

  



  

(e) _No Impairment_. The obligations set forth in this _Section
6.10_ may not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that
adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other Person who is a
beneficiary pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in
_Section 6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior
written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other Person. Each of
the Indemnified Persons or other Persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to
the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 6.10(c) _(and
their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries
of this _Section 6.10_, with full rights of enforcement as if such
Indemnified Persons or other Persons were a party to this Agreement. The
rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other Persons who are beneficiaries
pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section
6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) _shall in no way limit (but
shall not be in duplication of) _ any other rights that such Persons may have
pursuant to (i) Organizational Documents of the Company; (ii) the
Organizational Documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and
all indemnification agreements entered into with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law (whether at Law or in equity).

  



  

(f) _Other Claims_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or
will be construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and
officers' insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or
indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.10_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

  



  

6.11 _ _ _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Acknowledgement_. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that a
"change of control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Company
Stock Plans or any award agreement will occur as of the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) _Existing Arrangements_. From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor all of the Employee Plans
and compensation and severance arrangements in accordance with their terms as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, and except as otherwise set forth in this _Section 6.11_ , nothing
will prohibit the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, from amending or terminating any such Employee Plans or
compensation or severance arrangements in accordance with their terms or if
otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law.

  



  

   

-78-

 



    



  

(c) _Employment; Benefits_. For a period of one year following the
Effective Time (the "Continuation Period"), the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) (i) provide compensation, benefits and severance to each
Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the
aggregate than the compensation (including the total target cash incentive
compensation opportunity, but excluding any equity-based
incentive compensation), benefits and severance provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Comparable Plans"); or
(ii) provide some combination of Company Plans, Comparable Plans and New Plans
such that each Continuing Employee receives compensation (including the total
cash target incentive compensation opportunity, but excluding any equity-
based incentive compensation), benefits and severance that, taken as a whole,
are no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation, benefits and
severance provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time. In each case, and without limiting the foregoing, (i) base
salary or base wage rate, and target cash incentive compensation opportunity,
will not be decreased below levels in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time during the Continuation Period for any Continuing Employee
employed during that period and (ii) during the Continuation Period, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) provide severance benefits and
compensation to eligible employees in accordance with the Company's severance
plans, guidelines and practices as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) _Comparable Plans and New Plans_. To the extent that a
Comparable Plan or New Plan is made available to any Continuing Employee at or
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service
with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits
where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation
accrual and severance entitlement, but not for purposes of any defined
benefit pension plan or retiree medical benefits) to the same extent such
service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under the
applicable Company Plan, except that such service need not be credited to the
extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits for the
same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee will be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit
plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than
the Company Plans) (such plans, the "New Plans") or any Comparable Plans to
the extent that coverage pursuant to any such New Plan or Comparable Plan
replaces coverage pursuant to a corresponding Company Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, the "Old Plans"); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan and each
Comparable Plan providing life insurance, medical, dental, pharmaceutical,
vision or disability benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause, or shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause third party insurance carriers and third party
administrators, as applicable, to waive, all waiting periods, pre-
existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and
actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan or Comparable Plan
for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date that such
Continuing Employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan or
Comparable Plan, as applicable, begins to be given full credit pursuant to
such New Plan or Comparable Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan

9.3 _  _ _Assignment_. No Party may assign either this Agreement or
any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder, by operation of Law

_provided_ , that Parent may assign its rights under this Agreement without

and any such Financing Source may exercise all of the rights and remedies of
Parent hereunder in connection with the enforcement of any security or
exercise of any remedies to the extent permitted under the Debt Financing
documentation; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment shall (x)
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder or (y) materially
impede or delay the consummation of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon and will inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. No assignment by any Party
will relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder. Any purported
assignment of this Agreement without the consent required by this _Section
9.3_  will be null and void.

  



  

9.4 _  _ _Confidentiality_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
hereby acknowledge that Oak Hill Capital Partners V (Onshore), L.P. and the
Company have previously executed a letter agreement, dated February 3, 2020
(the "Confidentiality Agreement"), that will continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms until the Closing, at which time the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Representatives shall hold and treat all documents and
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished or made
available to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives in
connection with the Transactions in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ that notwithstanding the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, upon notice to the Company, Parent may provide such documents and
information to Financing Sources subject to customary confidentiality
arrangements with such Persons regarding such information. By executing this
Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agree to be bound by, and to cause
their Representatives to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement as if they were parties thereto.

  



  

9.5 _  _ _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and
instruments and other agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or
referred to herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Guarantee and the Financing Letters, constitute the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement will (a) not be superseded; (b) survive
any termination of this Agreement; and (c) continue in full force and effect
until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the date on which the
Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms or is validly
terminated by the parties thereto.

  

  

  

  

  



  

9.6 _  _ _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in
_Section 6.10_ and this _Section 9.6_, the Parties agree that their
respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this
Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Parties in accordance with
and subject to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended
to, and will not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
hereunder, except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by  _Section 6.10_;
and (b) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of shares
of Class A Common Stock, Company RSUs and Company Options to receive the
merger consideration set forth in _Article II_. The provisions of  _Section
8.3(f)_ , _Section 9.10(b)_ , _Section 9.11_ , _Section 9.12_ , _Section 9.15_
, _Section 9.16 _ and this _Section 9.6_ will inure to the benefit of the
Financing Sources and their successors and assigns, each of whom are intended
to be third party beneficiaries thereof (it being understood and agreed that
the provisions of such Sections will be enforceable by the Financing Sources
and their respective successors and assigns).

  

  

  



  

   

 | -91-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

9.7 _  _ _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, or incapable of
being enforced under any applicable Law, the remainder of this Agreement will
continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to
other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect
the intent of the Parties so long as the economic or legal substance of the
Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party
hereto; _provided_ , that the economic and legal substance of the
Transactions shall be deemed to be affected in a manner materially adverse to
the Parties if _Section 8.3(f)_ , _Section 9.8_ or _Section 9.12_ is invalid,
void or incapable of being enforced. The Parties further agree to replace
such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and
enforceable provision that will achieve, to the fullest extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes and effects of such void or
unenforceable provision.

  



  

9.8 _  _ _Remedies_.

  



  

(a)   _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein,
any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by
Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

  



  

(b)   _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(i)  The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in
the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement
(including any Party failing to take such actions as are required of it
hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity, to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or
threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the right of
the Company to cause the Transactions to be consummated on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement) in the Chosen Courts
without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement; (B) the provisions of
_Section 8.3_ are not intended to and do not adequately compensate the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for
the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be
construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party's right to
an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief; and (C) the
right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and,
without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into
this Agreement. The Parties further agree that (1) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this _Section 9.8_ , a Party shall not in any respect waive
its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to such Party
under this Agreement; and (2) nothing set forth in this _Section 9.8_ shall
require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any Party's right
to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section
9.8_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under
_Article VIII_ , nor shall the commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant
to this _Section 9.8_ or anything set forth in this _Section 9.8_ restrict or
limit any Party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the
terms of _Article VIII_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement
that may be available then or thereafter. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) prior to the
earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, the sole remedy available to any Party
under this Agreement shall be specific performance pursuant to this _Section
9.8(b)_ to the extent available pursuant to the terms hereof, and (y) in no
event shall the Company be entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance to cause the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this
Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter) or other equitable relief, on the
one hand, and the payment of all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee
pursuant to 8.3(c) or any payments owed by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.3(e)_
, on the other hand.

  



  

   

 | -92-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii)  Notwithstanding _Section 9.8(b)(i)_, it is acknowledged and
agreed that the right to enforce Parent's obligation to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger will be subject to the
requirements that (A) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and
_Section 7.2_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable of being
satisfied at the Closing); (B) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the
Closing in accordance with _Section 2.3_; and (C) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent that if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing is funded, then it would take
such actions that are required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to
occur.

  



  

(iii)  The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the
granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to
prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and
(B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to
this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party
irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.

  



  

9.9 _  _ _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all disputes, claims,
actions, suits, proceedings or counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort
or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Transactions
or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, including its
statutes of limitations, without giving effect to any Laws or other rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Laws or statutes of limitations of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware.

9.10 _  _ _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a)   _General Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties (a) irrevocably
consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process
(whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts)
in any Legal Proceeding relating to the Transactions and the Guarantee, for
and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with
_Section 9.2_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law,
and nothing in this _Section 9.10_ will affect the right of any Party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (b)
irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its
properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware) (the
"Chosen Courts") in the event that any dispute or controversy arises out of
this Agreement, the Transactions, the Guarantee or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby; (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave
from any such court; (d) agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising in
connection with this Agreement, the Transactions, the Guarantee or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will be brought, tried and
determined only in the Chosen Courts; (e) waives any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen
Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court
and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (f) agrees that it will not
bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Transactions, the
Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby in any court
other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agrees that a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

  



  

(b)   _Jurisdiction for Financing Source_ s. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge and
irrevocably agree (i) that any Legal Proceeding, whether in Law or in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise, involving the Financing Sources arising
out of, or relating to, the Transactions, the Debt Financing or the
performance of services thereunder or related thereto will be subject to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of
New York in the borough of Manhattan and any appellate court thereof, and
each Party submits for itself and its property with respect to any such Legal
Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to bring or
permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing
any such Legal Proceeding in any other court; (iii) that service of process,
summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to them at their
respective addresses provided in any applicable Debt Commitment Letter will
be effective service of process against them for any such Legal Proceeding
brought in any such court; (iv) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any objection which any of them may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of, any such Legal Proceeding in any such court; and (v)
except as specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters or any
definitive agreement relating to the Debt Financing, any such Legal
Proceeding will be governed and construed in accordance with the Laws of the
State of New York.

9.11 _  _ _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO
A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF
CONTRACT, TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER, THE GUARANTEE, THE FINANCING
LETTERS, THE FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING
FINANCING SOURCES) OR THE OTHER AGREEMENTS TO BE ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH, AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY. EACH PARTY
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER;
(ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (iii)
IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.11_.

  



  

9.12 _  _ _No Recourse_. Without limiting Parent's rights and remedies
against the Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment Letters, this
Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or causes of action
that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may only be made
against the entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto and no
Parent Related Parties (other than Guarantors to the extent set forth in the
Guarantee or the Equity Commitment Letter) nor any Financing Sources shall
have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties to this
Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on,
in respect of, or by reason of, the Transactions or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith (other
than, in the case of the Financing Sources, to (x) Parent and its affiliates
in respect of the Debt Financing and (y) after giving effect to the Closing,
the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of the transactions contemplated
by the Debt Financing and/or the Debt Commitment Letter). Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, for the avoidance of doubt, 
_Section 9.8(b)_ shall not give the Company any right to enforce performance
by any Financing Source in connection with the Debt Financing..

  



  

9.13 _  _ _Company Disclosure Letter References_. The Parties agree
that the disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in
the corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement; and (ii) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company
that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause (ii) only
if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

9.14 _  _ _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may
be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one
and the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts
have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties,
it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart.
Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif,
.jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an
"Electronic Delivery"), will be treated in all manner and respects as an
original executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding
legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in
person. No Party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a
signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a
defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any
such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of
authenticity.

  



  

9.15 _  _ _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the
other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the
Parties at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (pursuant to authorized action
by the Company Board); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the
Company has received the Requisite Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be
made to this Agreement that requires the approval of the Company Stockholders
pursuant to the DGCL without such approval. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, (a) the provisions relating to the Financing
Sources set forth in _Section 9.6_ , _Section 9.10(b)_ , _Section 9.11_ , 
_Section 9.16_ and this _Section 9.15_ (and the defined terms used therein)
and (b) the definition of "Company Material Adverse Effect" may not be
amended, modified or altered in a manner materially adverse to the Financing
Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

  



  

9.16 _  _ _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior
to the Effective Time, any Party may, to the extent legally allowed and
except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, as applicable;
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such
Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c)
subject to the requirements of applicable Law, waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party contained herein;
_provided_ , however, the provisions relating to the Financing Sources set
forth in _Section 9.6_ , _Section 9.10(b)_ , _Section 9.11_ , _Section 9.12_
, _Section 9.15_ and this _Section 9.16_ (and the defined terms used therein)
may not be waived in a manner materially adverse to the Financing Sources
without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources. Any agreement on
the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by such Party. Any delay in
exercising any right pursuant to this Agreement will not constitute a waiver
of such right.
