(b) The Sellers and the Buyer shall jointly conduct a physical count of the
Inventory of the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries on the Closing

this Section 2.3(b). If the Parties cannot agree on the results of such count,
the Buyer shall use its calculation of the Inventory Amount for purposes of

immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet").

Balance Sheet shall (i) be prepared, and each component thereof shall be
determined, in accordance with (1) the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
(2) to the extent not inconsistent with the foregoing clause (1), the
accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures, conventions,
categorizations, definitions, principles, judgments, assumptions, techniques
or estimation methods with respect to financial statements, their
classification or presentation or otherwise (including with respect to the
nature of accounts, level of reserves or level of accruals) that are
consistent with the calculation set forth on Schedule I, (3) to the extent not
inconsistent with the foregoing clauses (1) or (2), accounting methods,
policies, practices, procedures, conventions, categorizations, definitions,
principles, judgments, assumptions, techniques or estimation methods with
respect to financial statements, their classification or presentation or
otherwise (including with respect to the nature of accounts, level of reserves
or level of accruals) adopted in connection with the Latest Balance Sheets,
and (4) to the extent not inconsistent with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) or
(3), GAAP as in effect on the Closing Date and (ii) not include any changes in

changes arising from or resulting as a consequence of the transactions
contemplated hereby ((i) and (ii) collectively, the "Accounting Methods").

are not intended to permit the introduction of different or additional
accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures, conventions,
categorizations, definitions, principles, judgments, assumptions, techniques
or estimation methods with respect to the financial statements, their
classification or presentation or otherwise (including with respect to the
nature of accounts, level of reserves or level of accruals) from the
Accounting Methods.

(f) The Companies, their respective Subsidiaries and the Buyer shall assist
the Sellers' Representative and the Sellers' Representative's representatives
in the review of the Closing Statement and the Closing Balance Sheet
(including by furnishing on a timely basis all information reasonably
necessary or useful in connection with such review) and shall provide the
Sellers' Representative and the Sellers' Representative's representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours, and upon reasonable advance
notice, to the books, records (including work papers, schedules, memoranda and
other documents), supporting data, facilities and relevant personnel of the
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries (including personnel responsible
for accounting and finance, senior management and accountants and advisors)
for purposes of their review of the Closing Statement and the Closing Balance
Sheet; provided that the Sellers' Representative shall, and shall cause its
representatives to, use its and their reasonable best efforts to conduct such
review in a manner that will not disrupt the operation of the business of the
Companies, their respective Subsidiaries or the Buyer. If the Sellers'
Representative disagrees with any part of the Buyer's calculation of the
Closing Cash Proceeds as set forth on the Closing Statement or the Closing
Balance Sheet, the Sellers' Representative shall, within 45 days after the
Sellers' Representative's receipt of the Closing Statement and the Closing
Balance Sheet, notify the Buyer in writing of such disagreement by setting
forth the Sellers' Representative's calculation of the Closing Cash Proceeds,
including each of the components thereof, and describing in reasonable detail
the basis for such disagreement (an "Objection Notice"); provided, that if the
Sellers' Representative requests, in good faith, an extension of time to
review the Buyer's determination of the Closing Cash Proceeds as set forth on
the Closing Statement or the Closing Balance Sheet, the Sellers'
Representative shall be given an additional 30 days within which to deliver an
Objection Notice. If an Objection Notice is delivered to the Buyer, then the
Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
their disagreements with respect to the computation of the Closing Cash
Proceeds. In the event that the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative are
unable to resolve all such disagreements within 30 days after the Buyer's
receipt of such Objection Notice (or such longer period as the Buyer and the
Seller may agree in writing), the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall
submit such remaining disagreements to PricewaterhouseCoopers, or another
nationally-recognized accounting firm as is acceptable to the Buyer and the
Sellers' Representative (the "Independent Accounting Firm").

(g) The Independent Accounting Firm shall make a final and binding
determination with respect to the computation of the Closing Cash Proceeds,
including each of the components thereof, to the extent such amounts are in
dispute, in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this
Agreement and on Exhibit C. The Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall
cooperate with the Independent Accounting Firm during the term of its
engagement and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Independent
Accounting Firm to resolve all remaining disagreements with respect to the
computation of the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each of the components
thereof, as soon as practicable. The Independent Accounting Firm shall
consider only those items and amounts in the Buyer's and the Sellers'
Representative's respective calculations of the Closing Cash Proceeds,
including each of the



components thereof, that are identified as being items and amounts to which
the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative have been unable to agree. In
resolving any disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm may not assign a
value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either Party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
Party. The Independent Accounting Firm's determination of the Closing Cash
Proceeds, including each of the components thereof, shall be based solely on
written materials submitted by the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative
(i.e., not on independent review) and on the definitions, terms and conditions
included herein. The determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Parties and shall not be subject to appeal or
further review.

(h) The costs and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm in determining
the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each of the components thereof, shall be
borne by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, based
upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to
each Party bears to the amount actually contested by such Party. For example,
if the Buyer claims the Closing Cash Proceeds is one thousand dollars ($1,000)
less than the Estimated Closing Cash Proceeds, and the Sellers' Representative
contests only five hundred dollars ($500) of the amount claimed by the Buyer,
and if the Independent Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by
awarding the Buyer three hundred dollars ($300) of the five hundred dollars
($500) contested, then the costs and expenses of the Independent Accounting
Firm will be allocated sixty percent (60%) (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to the Sellers
and forty percent (40%) (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to the Buyer. Prior to the
Independent Accounting Firm's determination of Closing Cash Proceeds, (i) the
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, will each pay
fifty percent (50%) of any retainer paid to the Independent Accounting Firm;
and (ii) during the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm, the
Independent Accounting Firm will bill fifty percent (50%) of the total charges
to each of the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand. In
connection with the Independent Accounting Firm's determination of the Closing
Cash Proceeds, the Independent Accounting Firm shall also determine, pursuant
to the terms of the first and second sentences of this Section 2.3(h), and
taking into account all fees and expenses already paid by each of the Buyer,
on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, as of the date of such
determination, the allocation of its fees and expenses between the Buyer and
the Seller, which such determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Parties hereto.

(i) Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Cash Proceeds, including
each of the components thereof, is finally determined pursuant to this Section
2.3:

(i) If the Closing Cash Proceeds as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.3 is greater than the Estimated Closing Cash Proceeds, the Buyer
shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days after the
determination thereof) deliver to the Sellers' Representative the amount of
such excess by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated by the Sellers' Representative for distribution to each
Seller in accordance with such Seller's Pro Rata Share as set forth on Exhibit
A. Immediately following payment of any amounts determined pursuant to this
Section 2.3(i)(i) to be owing to the Sellers, the Sellers' Representative and
the Buyer shall deliver joint instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to pay to the Sellers' Representative all remaining funds in the
Purchase Price Escrow Account, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, for distribution to each Seller in accordance with such Seller's
Pro Rata Share as set forth on Exhibit A.



(ii) If the Closing Cash Proceeds as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.3 is less than the Estimated Closing Cash Proceeds (such shortfall,
the "Purchase Price Shortfall"), the Sellers' Representative and the Buyer
shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days after the
determination of the Closing Cash Proceeds) deliver joint instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay from the Purchase Price
Escrow Account to an account or accounts designated by the Buyer an amount
equal to the Purchase Price Shortfall by wire transfer of immediately
available funds. Immediately following payment of any amounts determined
pursuant to this Section 2.3(i)(ii) to be owing to the Buyer, the Sellers'
Representative and the Buyer shall deliver joint instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to the Sellers' Representative all
remaining funds in the Purchase Price Escrow Account, in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement for distribution to each Seller in accordance
with such Seller's Pro Rata Share as set forth on Exhibit A.

(j) All adjustments pursuant to this Section 2.3, other than payments of
stated interest, shall be treated by all Parties for Tax purposes as
adjustments to the Transaction Price to the extent permitted under applicable
Law.

(k) The Buyer agrees that (i) payment pursuant to Section 2.3(i) from the
Purchase Price Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow Agreement shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy for payment of the Purchase Price Shortfall, if
any, and the Purchase Price Escrow Account shall be the sole and exclusive
source of recovery for any amounts owing to the Buyer pursuant to this Section
2.3, even if the Purchase Price Shortfall exceeds the Purchase Price Escrow
Amount, and (ii) the adjustment and the dispute resolution provisions provided
for in this Section 2.3 shall be the exclusive remedies for the matters
addressed or that could be addressed by this Section 2.3. For the avoidance of
doubt, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no claim by the
Buyer or any of its Affiliates or representatives for the payment of the
Purchase Price Shortfall shall be asserted against the Sellers. The payment(s)
pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall not be considered a breach of any
representation, warranty or other provision of this Agreement or any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Except in the case of Fraud by the
Sellers or the Sellers' Representative, neither the Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates or representatives shall make any claim in respect of the
determination of the Closing Cash Proceeds or any component thereof other than
in accordance with and as set forth in this Section 2.3.

2.4 Withholding Rights. The Buyer and each of the Companies (and each of their
respective Affiliates) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amount otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts
of Tax as the Buyer or the applicable Company (or any of their respective
Affiliates) is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment to such Person. All amounts that are deducted or withheld by the
Buyer or the applicable Company (or any of their respective Affiliates), as
the case may be, and paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental
Authority by the Buyer or the applicable Company (or their respective
Affiliates), as the case may be, shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in respect to which
such deduction and withholding was made (and immediately thereafter paid over
to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Authority by such Person).

ARTICLE IV 

COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

Each of the Parties agrees as follows with respect to the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Closing:



4.1 Reasonable Best Efforts.

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Party shall use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or
advisable in order to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (including

Sellers and the Buyer agree, and the Sellers, prior to the Closing, and the
Buyer, after the Closing, agree to cause the Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries, to execute and deliver such other documents, certificates,
agreements and other writings and to take such other actions as may be
necessary or desirable in order to consummate or implement expeditiously the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that nothing in this
Section 4.1(a) shall require any of the Sellers, the Companies or the Buyer to
expend any funds to obtain any third-party consents, and provided, further,
that the Buyer shall have no obligation to consent to any change in the terms
of any agreement or arrangement that would, or that would reasonably be
expected to, be materially adverse to the interests of the Buyer or the
Companies. At the Closing, the applicable Parties shall execute and deliver
the other agreements and instruments contemplated hereby to be executed and
delivered at the Closing.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the Buyer

Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event within three
(3) Business Days of the date hereof; (ii) cooperate and coordinate with the
other in the identification of any necessary filings and in the making of such
filings; (iii) supply as promptly as practicable and after consultation with
the other Parties any additional information and documentary material that may
be requested by any Governmental Authority pursuant to the HSR Act; and (iv)
use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other (1) in determining
whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any other Governmental
Authority is required, or any other actions, consents, approvals or waivers
are required to be obtained from parties to any material contracts, in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (2) in taking such actions or making any such filings,
furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking timely to
obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers in order to permit the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. To the extent permitted
by applicable Law, each Party will permit the other to review in advance any
proposed written submissions to any Governmental Authority and will, to the
extent allowed by the Governmental Authority, permit the other to attend any
meetings with the Governmental Authority. Any filing fees payable under the
HSR Act relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
borne by the Buyer.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Buyer agrees to use
its reasonable best efforts to eliminate each and every impediment under any
antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that is asserted by any
Governmental Authority or any other party so as to enable the Parties to close
the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement, the Parties understand and agree that the
reasonable best efforts of either Party shall not obligate the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates to divest or otherwise hold separate (including by establishing
a trust or otherwise), or take any similar action (or otherwise agreeing to do
any of the foregoing) with respect to any business, asset or property that was
owned by the Companies, their respective Subsidiaries, the Buyer or any of
their respective Affiliates prior to the date hereof.



(d) Subject to all applicable Laws, each Party will notify the other promptly
upon the receipt of (i) any comments from any officials of any Governmental
Authority in connection with any filings made pursuant to this Section 4.1 and

or supplements to any filings made pursuant to, or information provided to
comply in all material respects with, any Laws. Whenever any event occurs that
is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing made
pursuant to this Section 4.1, the Party filing such amendment or supplement
will promptly inform the other of such occurrence.

4.2 Maintenance of Business. From the date hereof until the earlier of the

effectuate and



document the provisions of this Section 4.6(a). "Seller Person" means each
Seller, its Affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors,
employees, partners, members, managers, agents, attorneys, representatives,
successors and permitted assigns.

(b) From and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, including by contractually shortening the applicable statute
of limitations, each Seller does hereby, for itself and on behalf of each
other Seller Person (each, a "Seller Releasing Party"), release, irrevocably

proposal or offer, or any inquiry or other contact with any Person with
respect thereto, is made. Any such notice to the Buyer shall indicate in
reasonable detail the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer,
inquiry or other contact and the terms and conditions of such proposal, offer,
inquiry or other contact. The Sellers shall not, and shall cause the Companies
and their respective Subsidiaries not to, release any Person from, or waive
any provision of, any confidentiality agreement to which any Seller, Company
or Subsidiary of a Company is a party, without the prior written consent of
the Buyer.

connection with this Agreement (such policy, a copy of which has been
furnished to the Sellers' Representative, the "RandW Insurance Policy"). At such
time as the Buyer obtains the final RandW Insurance Policy, the Buyer shall
provide a copy of such policy to the Sellers' Representative as promptly as

indemnification, contribution or other rights to pursue any claims against any
Seller or the Sellers' Representative (except claims for Fraud against the
Sellers), and none of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall amend, waive,

ARTICLE VIII 

TERMINATION

8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing only as follows:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Sellers (each for itself and on behalf of the Companies), on the other hand;

(b) by the Buyer, if there has been a misrepresentation or a breach of
warranty or a breach of a covenant by the Sellers or the Companies in the
representations and warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement (which
in the case of any breach which is curable has not been cured within thirty
(30) days after written notification thereof by the Buyer to the Sellers'
Representative), such that the conditions set forth in Article III would not
be satisfied; provided that the Buyer shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) if it is then in material breach of
this Agreement;

(c) by the Sellers (for themselves and on behalf of the Companies), if there
has been a misrepresentation or a breach of warranty or a breach of a covenant
by the Buyer in the representations and warranties or covenants set forth in
this Agreement (which in the case of any breach which is curable has not been
cured within thirty (30) days after written notification thereof by the
Sellers' Representative to the Buyer), such that the conditions set forth in
Article III would not be satisfied; provided that the Sellers shall not be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) if any of
the Sellers are then in material breach of this Agreement;

(d) by the Buyer if the Closing shall not have occurred by February 28, 2020
(the "End Date"); provided, that the Buyer shall not be entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) if the Buyer's material breach
of this Agreement has prevented the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; or

without any liability or obligation on the part of any Party, (i) other than
liabilities and obligations under the Confidentiality

be satisfied at the Closing), but (1) the Buyer fails to complete the Closing

performance or other equitable relief as provided in Section 11.13 with

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENT AND COVENANTS

9.1 Acknowledgement by the Buyer.

(a) The Buyer is an informed and sophisticated purchaser, and has engaged
expert advisors, experienced in the evaluation and purchase of companies such
as the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries as contemplated hereunder.
The Buyer has undertaken to its satisfaction such investigation and has been
provided with and has evaluated such documents and information as it has
deemed necessary to enable it to make an informed and intelligent decision
with respect to the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement,
including without limitation an independent investigation and verification of
the financial condition, results of operations, assets, properties,
liabilities and prospects of the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries.
The Buyer acknowledges that the Sellers have given the Buyer complete and open
access to the key employees, documents and facilities of the Companies and
their respective Subsidiaries. The Buyer will undertake prior to Closing such
further investigation and request such additional documents and information as
it deems necessary. In making its determination to proceed with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Buyer (i) has relied solely
on the results of its own investigation and verification and the
representations and warranties of the Sellers expressly and specifically set
forth in Article V and the Companies expressly and specifically set forth in
Article VI, as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules, and (ii) has not relied
on the accuracy or completeness of any other information, representation or
warranty provided to (or otherwise acquired by) the Buyer or any of its
Related Parties. The representations and warranties of the Sellers expressly
and specifically set forth in Article V and the Companies expressly and
specifically set forth in Article VI, in each case as qualified by the
Disclosure Schedules, constitute the sole and exclusive representations,
warranties, and statements (including by omission) of any kind of the Sellers,
the Companies or any of their respective Related Parties in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and all other
representations, warranties, and statements (including by omission) of any
kind or nature, whether oral or written, express or implied, statutory or
otherwise, as to any matter concerning the Sellers, the Companies or their
respective Affiliates or in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, are specifically waived by the Buyer and disclaimed by the
Sellers, the Companies and each of their respective Related Parties,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, any representation or warranty with
respect to the historical or future



financial or other condition, results of operations, assets, properties or
liabilities of the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries, the quality,
quantity, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, conformity to
samples or other condition of the assets of the Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries, or the accuracy or completeness of any other information
provided to (or otherwise acquired by) the Buyer or any of its Related
Parties. EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS
EXPRESSLY AND SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE V AND THE COMPANIES EXPRESSLY
AND SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE VI, IN EACH CASE AS QUALIFIED BY THE
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES, THE BUYER IS ACQUIRING THE SECURITIES AND THE COMPANIES
AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES AND THEIR UNDERLYING ASSETS, BUSINESSES AND
LIABILITIES (WHETHER KNOWN OR UNKNOWN AND WHETHER ACCRUED OR NOT ON THE
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES) ON AN
"AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS.

(b) None of the Sellers, the Companies or any Related Party thereof, whether
in an individual, corporate or any other capacity, will have or be subject to
any liability or obligation (indemnification or otherwise) to the Buyer or any
of its Related Parties resulting from (nor shall the Buyer or any of its
Related Parties have any claim with respect to) the distribution to the Buyer
or its Related Parties, or the Buyer's or its Related Parties' use of, or
reliance on, any information, documents, projections, forecasts or other
material made available to the Buyer or any of its Related Parties, whether
through the Data Room or presentations (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any "management presentations") or otherwise, in expectation of, or in
connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
otherwise, regardless of the legal theory under which such liability or
obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether in contract or tort, at law or
in equity, or otherwise.

(c) Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Buyer
acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make
projections, forward looking statements and other forecasts and estimates, and
certain business plan information, that the Buyer is familiar with such
uncertainties, that the Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of any such projections, forward
looking statements, forecasts, estimates and business plan information
provided to it in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
projections, forward looking statements, forecasts, estimates and business
plan information), that no representations, warranties or statements
(including by omission) of any kind are being made with respect thereto, that
neither the Buyer nor any of its Related Parties is relying thereon, and that
the Buyer and its Related Parties shall have no claim against anyone with
respect thereto.

and at such Party's expense, any other Party shall execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and
shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as such
requesting Party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence and/or
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



9.3 Employees and Employee Benefits. Within five (5) days prior to the Closing
Date, the Sellers shall deliver an updated version of Section 6.13(a) of the
Disclosure Schedules.

(a) Salary and Wages. Effective as of the Closing and continuing for a period
of at least one (1) year thereafter, the Buyer will cause the Companies and
their respective Subsidiaries to provide each employee of a Company or its
Subsidiary as of immediately prior to the Closing, including each such
employee on medical, disability, family or other leave of absence (each, a
"Retained Employee") who remains employed with such Company or such
Subsidiary, at least the same base wages, annual base salary and annual rate
of cash bonus potential in effect immediately prior the Closing Date to the
extent permitted by applicable Law. Nothing in this Section 9.3(a) shall
obligate the Buyer or the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries to
continue the employment of any such Retained Employee for any specific period.

(b) Transaction Success Bonus. In addition to the Buyer's obligations under
Section 9.3(a), the Buyer agrees to make the transaction success bonus
payments described on Section 1.1(a) of the Disclosure Schedules to the
Retained Employees identified thereon. Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall
have the right, from time to time, to supplement, modify or update Section
1.1(a) of the Disclosure Schedule in Sellers' discretion. The Buyer shall make
each such transaction success bonus payment less all required and authorized
deductions and withholdings. If a Retained Employee's employment is terminated
for Cause or such Retained Employee voluntarily resigns, any unpaid
installments of such Retained Employee's transaction success bonus will be
forfeited. If a Retained Employee is terminated without Cause, or if such
Retained Employee's employment is terminated as a result of death or
disability, any unpaid installments of the transaction success bonus will be
paid to such Retained Employee by Buyer in full in a lump sum upon
termination. In addition, if a Retained Employee retires at age 65 or older
and such Retained Employee has completed at least one (1) year of service with
the Buyer, the Companies or their respective Affiliates after the Closing, any
unpaid installments of such transaction success bonus will be paid by the
Buyer to such Retained Employee in full in a lump sum upon such Retained
Employee's retirement. If for any reason a transaction success bonus is
forfeited by a Retained Employee, or if the Buyer does not, or will not, make
a payment described on Section 1.1(a) of the Disclosure Schedules, the Buyer
shall promptly notify the Sellers' Representative and pay such amount to
Sellers' Representative by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by the Sellers' Representative for distribution to each
Seller in accordance with such Seller's Pro Rata Share as set forth on Exhibit
A. For the avoidance of doubt, the payments described on Section 1.1(a) of the
Disclosure Schedules shall not be counted towards the Buyer's bonus payment
obligations in Section 9.3(a). Nothing in this Section 9.3(b) shall obligate
the Buyer, the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries to continue the
employment of any such Retained Employee for any specific period.

(c) Employee Benefits. As of the Closing Date and for a period of at least one
(1) year thereafter, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Buyer
shall provide, or shall cause the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries
to provide, each Retained Employee with employee benefits (including severance
benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits
provided to such Retained Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date.
Effective as of the Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause the Companies and
their respective Subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms, all
Benefit Plans of the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing that are applicable to any current or former
employees or directors of the Companies or any of their respective
Subsidiaries. Nothing set forth in this Section 9.3 is intended to or shall
(i) be treated as



an amendment of any particular Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of the
Buyer or any its Affiliates, (ii) prevent the Buyer or its Affiliates from
amending or terminating any of their employee benefit plans or, after the
Closing Date, any Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms or (iii) prevent
the Buyer or its Affiliates, after the Closing Date, from terminating the
employment of any employee of the Companies or their respective Subsidiaries
or changing any terms and conditions of their employment.

(d) Employee Service Credit. The Buyer (i) shall give, or cause the Companies
and their respective Subsidiaries to give, each Retained Employee under any
Benefit Plan that covers the Retained Employee after the Closing Date,
including any vacation, sick leave and severance policies, credit for purposes
of eligibility for and vesting of benefits for the Retained Employee's service
with any of Companies or their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, prior
to the Closing Date to the same extent recognized under the applicable
comparable Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date and to the
extent such recognition does not result in a duplication of benefits, (ii)
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow such Retained Employees to
participate in each plan providing welfare benefits (including medical,
dental, vision, life insurance, short-term disability, long‑term disability
insurance and long‑term care insurance) without regard to
preexisting‑condition limitations, waiting periods, evidence of insurability
or other exclusions or limitations not imposed on the Retained Employee by the
corresponding Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (iii)
if any of the Benefit Plans are terminated prior to the end of the plan year
that includes the Closing Date, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
credit the Retained Employee with any expenses that were covered by the
Benefit Plans for purposes of determining deductibles, co‑pays and other
applicable limits under any similar replacement plans.

(e) Vacation Pay and Personal Holidays. The Buyer shall cause the Companies
and their respective Subsidiaries to continue to credit to each Retained
Employee all vacation and personal holiday pay that the Retained Employee is
entitled to use but has not used as of the Closing Date (including any earned
vacation or personal holiday pay to be used in future years), and shall assume
all liability for the payment of such amounts.

(f) Effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date, Industries shall take all actions necessary to terminate the Companies'
participation as participating employers in the AGC Southwest Chapters 401(k)
Plan so that no contributions are made to such plan for any payroll date
ending on or after the Closing Date. The Sellers shall provide proof of such
termination of participation to the Buyer prior to the Closing Date. As soon
as practicable after the Closing Date, and to the extent not prohibited under
applicable Law, the Buyer shall take all action necessary to provide that each
Retained Employee may elect to rollover his or her full account balance
(including cash, notes (in the case of loans) or a combination thereof) from
the AGC Southwest Chapters 401(k) Plan to a tax-qualified defined contribution
plan established or designated by the Buyer.



(g) No Third Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Section 9.3 are
solely for the benefit of the Parties, and no current or former employee,
officer, director or consultant, or any other individual or entity associated
therewith, shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of
this Section 9.3. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to
confer upon any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant,
any right to employment or continued employment or continued service with the
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, or constitute an amendment to any Benefit
Plan or create an employment agreement with any individual.

9.4 Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification.

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, the Companies shall,
and the Buyer shall cause the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries to,
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers, directors,
managers, partners or similar functionaries of the Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior
to the Closing Date to the extent provided under the organizational or
constituent documents of the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries in
effect on the date hereof.

(b) Prior to or simultaneously with the Closing, the Sellers shall, or shall
cause the Companies to purchase, at the Buyer's cost and expense, from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the current
insurance carrier of the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries with
respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance, a prepaid insurance
policy (i.e., "tail coverage") which provides "directors and officers"
insurance coverage for each of the individuals who were officers, directors,
managers, partners or similar functionaries of any of the Companies or their
respective Subsidiaries at or prior to the Closing on no less favorable terms
(including in amount and scope) as the policy or policy(ies) maintained by the
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing
for the benefit of such individuals for an aggregate claims reporting or
discovery period of not less than six (6) years from and after the Closing
Date with respect to claims arising from acts, events or omissions that
occurred at or prior to the Closing, including with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such policy the "DandO Tail
Policy"); provided that in no event shall the annual premium for the DandO Tail
Policy exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the most recent aggregate annual
premium allocation of the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries; and
provided further that if the annual premium of such insurance coverage exceeds
such amount, the Buyer shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing,
for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, the Buyer shall not, and
shall not permit the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries to, amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any provision in the certificate of incorporation
or by-laws (or equivalent governing documents) of the Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries relating to the exculpation or indemnification of any
officers, directors or similar functionaries (unless to provide for greater
exculpation or indemnification or unless required by Law), it being the intent
of the Parties hereto that the current and former officers, directors,
partners, managers and similar functionaries of any of the Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and
indemnification (including with respect to advancement of expenses) to the
extent provided under each governing document of the Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries



in effect on the date hereof. The Buyer agrees and acknowledges that this
Section 9.4 shall be binding on the Buyer's successors and assigns.

(d) If the Buyer, the Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any
successor or assign of any of the foregoing (i) shall consolidate with or
merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and
in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that successors and
assigns of the Buyer, the Companies or such Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 9.4.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if on or prior
to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing, any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, on or after the Closing
Date) is made against any individual who was an officer, director, partner,
manager or similar functionary of any of the Companies or their respective
Subsidiaries at or prior to the Closing or any other party covered by
directors' and officers' liability insurance, the provisions of this Section
9.4 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(f) The provisions of this Section 9.4 shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to affect adversely any indemnitee or exculpee to whom this
Section 9.4 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee or
exculpee. The provisions of this Section 9.4 are intended for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by (as express third party beneficiaries), each
current and former officer, director, partner, manager or similar functionary
of the Companies or any their respective Subsidiaries and his or her heirs and
representatives, successors and assigns and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have had by contract or otherwise.

9.5 Certain Access Provisions.

(a) For a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
preserve and retain, and the Buyer shall cause the Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries to preserve and retain and maintain, in an accessible
form, all corporate, accounting, legal, auditing or other books and records of
the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries relating to the conduct of the
business and operations of the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries
prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that the Buyer shall preserve,
retain and maintain, and shall cause the Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries to preserve and retain, in an accessible form, all Tax books and
records until the later of (i) the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date
and (ii) six (6) months after the last date required for retention of such
books and records under applicable Law.

(b) After the Closing Date, upon reasonable advance written notice, the Buyer
shall cause the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries to permit the
Sellers (and any Seller's counsel, advisors, agents or other representatives)
to have reasonable access during normal business hours, to inspect and copy
(including in electronic form) all materials referred to in this Section 9.5
as is reasonably necessary to facilitate the resolution of any claims made by
or against or incurred by the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates
after the Closing or for any other reasonable business purpose. Nothing in
this Section 9.5 shall obligate the Buyer to take any action that would (i)
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its business or unreasonably
disrupt its normal operations, (ii) jeopardize any attorney-client privilege,



protection under the work product doctrine or other legal privilege of such
Party or any of its Affiliates, (iii) violate any applicable Law or (iv)
breach any duty of confidentiality or other obligation owed to any Person.

9.6 Notification. Each of the Buyer and the Sellers shall promptly notify the
other of:

(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

(c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to
its knowledge threatened in writing against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting the Sellers, the Buyer or their respective Affiliates
that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
have been disclosed on the Disclosure Schedules or pursuant to Section 7.5, as
applicable, or that relate to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
9.6 shall not limit any of the representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement or the remedies available hereunder to the Parties.

9.7 Certain Consents. The Buyer acknowledges that certain consents to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties to
contracts or other agreements to which one or more of the Companies or their
respective Subsidiaries is a party and that such consents have not been
obtained and may not be obtained. The Buyer agrees that none of the Companies
or their respective Subsidiaries or the Sellers shall have any obligation or
liability whatsoever to the Buyer (and the Buyer shall not be entitled to
assert any claims) arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any
consents that may have been or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of the default,
acceleration or termination of or loss of right or benefit under any such
contract or other agreement as a result thereof. The Buyer further agrees that
no representation, warranty or covenant of the Companies or the Sellers
contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached and no condition of the
Buyer shall be deemed not to be satisfied as a result of the failure to obtain
any consent or as a result of any such default, acceleration or termination or
loss of right or benefit or any action commenced or threatened by or on behalf
of any Person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consent
or any such default, acceleration or termination or loss of right or benefit.

9.8 Tax Matters.

(a) Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns.

(i) The Companies shall prepare and timely file all Tax Returns of the
Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries required to be filed (taking
into account extensions) prior to the Closing Date. Unless otherwise required
by Law, none of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall (or shall cause or
permit any other Person to) (A) except as otherwise provided in this Section
9.8, amend, re-file or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in
part to the Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries with respect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period; (B) make any Tax election not otherwise permitted



by this Agreement that has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
(or portion thereof); (C) file any ruling or request with any taxing authority
that relates to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Companies or any of their
respective Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period; or (D) enter into or
initiate any voluntary disclosure agreement with any taxing authority
regarding any Tax or Tax Returns of the Companies or any of their respective
Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case, without the prior
written consent of the Sellers, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

(ii) Subject to Section 9.8(b), the Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and timely file, or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns with respect
to the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries that are required to be
filed following the Closing Date. The Sellers shall be responsible for all
Taxes that are shown as due on any such Tax Return filed by the Buyer relating
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the due date of any such Tax Return, the Sellers' Representative shall pay to
the Buyer, on behalf of the Sellers, the amount of Taxes that are the Sellers'
responsibility with respect to such Tax Return under the prior sentence.

(iii) Any Tax Return of the Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries
to be prepared and filed after the Closing Date for taxable periods beginning
before the Closing Date shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the last
previous similar Tax Return to the extent permissible under applicable Law.
Each of the Parties agrees that the Transaction Tax Deductions shall be
allocated to Pre-Closing Tax Periods to the maximum extent allowable by
applicable Law. The Buyer shall provide the Sellers' Representative with a
draft Tax Return for any such taxable period (and such additional information
regarding such Tax Return as may reasonably be requested by the Sellers'
Representative) at least fifteen (15) days prior to the filing of such Tax
Return, except that in the case of a Tax Return due within ninety (90) days
following the Closing Date, the copy shall be provided to the Seller's
Representative within ten (10) days prior to the filing. The Buyer shall
consider in good faith any comments of the Sellers' Representative to such Tax
Return, and shall not file any such Tax Return without the prior written
consent of the Sellers' Representative, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. The Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall use
good faith efforts to resolve any dispute regarding the preparation of Tax
Returns after the Closing Date for Tax periods beginning before the Closing
Date, prior to the date on which the relevant Tax Return is required to be
filed. The Sellers shall be responsible for all Taxes that are shown as due on
any such Tax Return filed by the Buyer relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period.
No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the due date of any such Tax
Return, the Sellers' Representative shall pay to the Buyer, on behalf of the
Sellers, the amount of Taxes that are the Sellers' responsibility with respect
to such Tax Return under the prior sentence.

(b) Cooperation. The Buyer, the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries,
and the Sellers shall cooperate, as reasonably requested by the other party,
in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. The Companies and their respective Subsidiaries agree to retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Companies and
their respective Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before
the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to
the extent notified by the Sellers' Representative, any extensions thereof) of
the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record



retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority. The Companies
shall, and the Buyer shall cause the Companies to, furnish any Tax information
requested by the Sellers' Representative for inclusion in any Seller's income
Tax Returns for the period that includes the Closing Date. The Sellers shall
not settle any audit in a manner that would adversely affect the Companies or
of their respective Subsidiaries after the Closing Date without the prior
written consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

(c) Allocation of Purchase Price. Within one hundred and eighty (180) days
following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the
Sellers' Representative an allocation of the purchase price (adjusted as
necessary to determine the purchase price for U.S. federal income tax purposes
(as so adjusted for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the "Tax Allocation
Purchase Price")) among each of the Companies, and further amongst the assets
of Cherry Crawford and Selinsky (including, as applicable, the assets of their
respective Subsidiaries) (the "Allocation Schedule"). The Allocation Schedule
shall be determined in accordance with the purchase price allocation
methodology set forth on Schedule II to this Agreement (which purchase price
allocation methodology is in accordance with the general principles of
Sections 338 (as applicable) and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder). Unless the Sellers' Representative objects to the
Buyer's draft of the Allocation Schedule within thirty (30) days after receipt
thereof, such Allocation Schedule shall be final. If the Sellers'
Representative objects to the Buyer's Allocation Schedule within thirty (30)
days of receipt, then the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to agree, within thirty (30) days of the
Sellers' Representative's objection to the Allocation Schedule, to an
allocation of the Tax Allocation Purchase Price among the assets of the
Companies (and, as applicable, the Subsidiaries of the Companies). In the
event such mutual agreement cannot be achieved, the Buyer shall engage the
Independent Accounting Firm to determine the Allocation Schedule, the costs of
which are to be shared equally among the Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Sellers, on the other hand; provided, that in determining the Allocation
Schedule, the Independent Accounting Firm shall apply and be bound by the
purchase price allocation methodology set forth on Schedule II to this
Agreement (and may not vary from such principles). Once the Allocation
Schedule is final, whether by virtue of the Sellers's Representative's deemed
acquiescence, by express written mutual agreement among the Parties, or by
calculation of the Independent Accounting Firm, neither the Buyer, any of the
Sellers, nor any of their respective Affiliates shall, subject to Section
9.8(e), take any position that is inconsistent with such final Allocation
Schedule (or file any Tax Returns (including amended returns and claims for
refund) and information reports in a manner not consistent with the Allocation
Schedule).

(d) Tax Treatment of Acquisition of Cherry Crawford and Selinsky. The Buyer
and the Sellers agree that the sale and purchase of the Securities of Cherry
Crawford and Selinsky shall be treated for federal income Tax purposes, and,
if applicable, any analogous state or local income Tax purposes, as a sale of
the Securities of Cherry Crawford and Selinsky by the Sellers and acquisition
of assets of Cherry Crawford and Selinsky from the Sellers by the Buyer, as
provided in Situation 2 of IRS Revenue Ruling 99-6. The parties agree that the
taxable year of each of Cherry Crawford and Selinsky will end as of the
Closing Date with respect to the federal income Tax Returns of such Companies.
Subject to Section 9.8(e), the Parties shall report, act and file Tax Returns
in all respects and for all purposes consistent with the foregoing treatment
and no party shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns or
otherwise) that is inconsistent with the foregoing treatment.



(e) Tax Reporting Obligations. Except to the extent otherwise required
pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code, the Buyer, the Sellers, and their respective Affiliates shall report,
act, and file all applicable Tax Returns in all respects and for all Tax
purposes consistent with (i) the final Allocation Schedule and (ii) the agreed
tax reporting for the transaction described in this Agreement (including,
without limitation, Section 9.8(d)), and neither the Buyer nor any of the
Sellers shall take, or permit their respective Affiliates (including the
Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries) to take, a position for Tax
purposes that is inconsistent with clause (i) or clause (ii) of this Section
9.8(e); provided, that this Section 9.8(e) shall not be interpreted as
limiting any Party's ability to settle, in good faith, any Tax dispute with
the appropriate Governmental Authority concerning the final Allocation
Schedule.

(f) Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax sharing agreements or similar arrangements
with respect to or involving the Companies and/or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (other than any agreement entered into in the ordinary course of
business and not primarily concerning Taxes) shall be terminated prior to the
Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, none of the Companies or any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be bound thereby or have any liability
thereunder for amounts due in respect of periods ending on or before the
Closing Date.

(g) Certain Post-Closing Actions. The Buyer and the Sellers agree to report
all transactions not in the ordinary course of business occurring on the
Closing Date after the Closing on the Buyer's (or the applicable Company's
separate) federal income Tax Return to the extent permitted by Treas. Reg. §
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B). The Buyer agrees to indemnify the Sellers for any
additional tax owed by the Sellers (or any consolidated, combined, or similar
group of which the Seller is a member) resulting from any transaction engaged
in by the Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries not in the
ordinary course of business occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing,
except to the extent such Tax is an Indemnified Tax or results from one of the
representations in Section 6.16 being untrue.

(h) Pre-Closing Tax Indemnity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated
elsewhere in this Agreement, the Sellers, jointly and severally, shall
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless, the Buyer, the Companies, and their
respective Affiliates against any and all Indemnified Taxes. The
indemnification required hereunder for Indemnified Taxes shall be made by
prompt payment by the Sellers' Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, as
and when the Sellers' Representative is notified of the amount of such Taxes
by the Buyer (or its Affiliate). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
stated elsewhere in this Agreement, the obligations of the Sellers (including
the Sellers' Representative) under this Section 9.8(h) shall survive until
sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(including extensions).



(i) Sellers' Representative Consent. Without the written consent of the
Sellers' Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), the Buyer and the Companies shall not, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates not to, (A) extend or waive, or cause to be
extended or waived, or permit the Companies to extend or waive, any statute of
limitations or other period for the assessment of any Tax or deficiency
related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (provided that, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Section 9.8(i) or elsewhere in this Agreement, the
Buyer may, on behalf of any of the Companies, and without the consent of any
of the Sellers (or the Sellers' Representative), extend or waive, or cause to
be extended or waived, and permit the Companies to extend or waive, any
statute of limitations or other period for the assessment of any Tax or
deficiency (including a Tax or deficiency related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period)
in the ordinary course of business (including, without limitation, by
obtaining an ordinary course extension with respect to a Tax Return filing
obligation)), (B) make or change any Tax election or accounting method or
practice that has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (C)
initiate any voluntary disclosure or other communication with any taxing
authority relating to any actual or potential Tax payment or Tax Return filing
obligation of the Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (D) take any
action on or after the Closing Date that would result in any liability with
respect to Taxes to the Sellers under this Agreement or otherwise.

(j) Contest Provisions. The Sellers' Representative shall promptly notify the
Buyer in writing upon receipt by the Sellers' Representative, and the Buyer
shall promptly notify the Sellers' Representative in writing upon receipt by
the Buyer, any of its Affiliates, or the Companies, of notice of any pending
or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits, examinations or
assessments which might affect the Tax liabilities of the Companies or any
Seller for the Pre-Closing Tax Period ("Tax Proceeding"); provided, however,
that failure to provide notice of a Tax Proceeding shall not relieve any party
of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement except to the extent such party
was materially prejudiced by such failure. The Buyer shall afford the Sellers'
Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, at the Sellers' expense, the
opportunity to control the conduct of any Tax Proceeding relating solely to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period; provided, that the Buyer shall have, at the expense of
the Buyer, the opportunity to reasonably participate in any such Tax
Proceeding relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period if such Tax Proceeding (or the
outcome of such Tax Proceeding) could reasonably be expected to affect or have
an impact on the Buyer, an Affiliate of the Buyer, or any of the Companies on
or after the Closing Date. The Buyer (and any Affiliate of the Buyer), at the
expense of the Buyer, shall have the right to control the conduct of any
pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits,
examinations or assessments relating to a Straddle Period that might affect
the Tax liabilities of any Company, the Buyer, or any Affiliate of Buyer;
provided, that the Sellers' Representative shall have, at the expense of the
Sellers, the opportunity to reasonably participate in any such audits,
examinations or assessments relating to a Straddle Period if such audits,
examinations or assessments (or the outcome of such audits, examinations or
assessments) could reasonably be expected to have an adverse impact on the
Sellers. Neither the Buyer nor the Sellers' Representative shall settle,
compromise or concede any such Tax Proceeding with respect to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period or any audits, examinations or assessments with respect to a
Straddle Period without the written consent of the other, which such written
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.



(k) If the Internal Revenue Service makes an adjustment to an item of income,
gain, loss, deduction, or credit of the Cherry Crawford or Selinsky (or any
partner's distributive share thereof) that would result in an "imputed
underpayment" within the meaning of Section 6225 of the Code (such imputed
underpayment, together with any associated interest and penalties, an "Imputed
Underpayment"), then Cherry Crawford or Selinsky shall, if permitted under
Section 6226 of the Code, timely and properly make the election to "push out"
any adjustments to the partners, such that Cherry Crawford or Selinsky, as
applicable, shall not be liable for any Imputed Underpayment resulting from
such adjustments.

9.9 Non-Compete; Non-Solicit.

(a) During the Restricted Period, each of the Sellers shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly in any capacity through
any Person or contractual arrangement, engage in, manage, control or have any
direct or indirect ownership interest in, any business anywhere in the United
States, other than the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries, that
engages in any business that competes with business of the Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries as conducted or contemplated to be conducted on the
date hereof and in the three (3) years prior to the date hereof (a "Competing
Business"); provided, however, that this Section 9.9(a) shall not prevent any
of the Sellers or their Affiliates from (i) holding or making investments not
in excess of 2% of the outstanding securities of any publicly-traded entity
regardless of whether such Person engages in a Competing Business, or (ii)
purchasing, leasing, developing and selling real property containing sand
reserves in accordance with Section 9.10.

(b) During the Restricted Period, each of the Sellers, shall not and shall
cause each of their respective Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly
through any Person or contractual arrangement, (i) solicit for employment or
hire any Person who is an employee of the Companies or their respective
Subsidiaries or any Person who was employed by the Companies or their
respective Subsidiaries in the past six (6) months (except for a Person whose
employment was terminated by the Companies without Cause within such six (6)
month period), (ii) induce or encourage any director, officer or employee of
the Companies or their respective Subsidiaries to terminate his or her
employment with such Company or Subsidiary, (iii) influence or attempt to
influence any customers, distributors or suppliers of the Companies or their
Subsidiaries to divert their business to any competitor of the Companies or in
any way interfere with the relationship between any such customer, distributor
or supplier and the Companies (including making any disparaging or negative
statements or communications about the Companies and their business), (iv)
take any action that is designed or intended to have the effect of
discouraging any customer, supplier, lessor, licensor, or other business
associate of the Companies or their Subsidiaries from maintaining the same
business relationships after the Closing as it maintained prior to the
Closing, or (v) disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate to any Person other
than the Companies, the Buyer or their respective Subsidiaries and their
respective officers, managers, directors and employees, or use or otherwise
exploit for its own benefit or the benefit of anyone other than the Companies,
the Buyer or their respective Subsidiaries, any confidential or proprietary
information of the Companies or their Subsidiaries; provided, that the
foregoing shall not prohibit (i) a general solicitation to the public through
general advertising or similar methods of solicitation not specifically
directed at employees of the Companies or their Subsidiaries or (ii) the
solicitation of any employee who has been terminated by any of the Companies
or their Subsidiaries prior to any such solicitation. It shall not be a
violation of this Section 9.9(b) for any Seller to disclose, divulge or
communicate any confidential or proprietary information to the extent (A)
required under applicable Law, including as a result of any judicial order or
subpoena, (B) as necessary to permit Sellers to file Tax



Returns, including discussions with their representatives or (C) to defend or
enforce any claim or action arising under this Agreement.

(c) Each of the Sellers acknowledges that the covenants set forth in this
Section 9.9 are an essential element of this Agreement and that any breach by
any such Seller of any provision of this Section 9.9 will result in
irreparable injury to the Buyer and the Companies. Each of the Sellers
acknowledges that in the event of such a breach, in addition to all other
remedies available at law, the Buyer shall be entitled to equitable relief,
including injunctive relief, as well as such other damages as may be
appropriate. Each of the Sellers has independently consulted with its counsel
and after such consultation agrees that the covenants set forth in this
Section 9.9 are reasonable and proper to protect the legitimate interest of
the Buyer.

(d) If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the character,
duration or geographical scope of the provisions of this Section 9.9 are
unreasonable, it is the intention and the agreement of the Buyer and the
Sellers that these provisions shall be construed by the court in such a manner
as to impose only those restrictions on the Sellers' conduct that are
reasonable in light of the circumstances and as are necessary to assure to the
Companies and the Buyer the benefits of this Agreement. If, in any judicial
proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce all of the separate covenants of
this Section 9.9 because taken together they are more extensive than necessary
to assure to the Companies and the Buyer the intended benefits of this
Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed by the parties hereto that
the provisions hereof that, if eliminated, would permit the remaining separate
provisions to be enforced in such proceeding, shall be deemed eliminated, for
the purposes of such proceeding, from this Agreement.

9.10 Buyer Right of First Refusal.

(a) During the Employment Period, Leonard Cherry will work to identify, on
behalf of the Buyer and the Companies, real property containing sand or gravel
reserves (any property so identified, a "Subject Property"). Upon
identification of a Subject Property, Leonard Cherry will notify the Buyer of
such Subject Property in writing, and the Buyer and its Affiliates will have
the first right to acquire the Subject Property. If the Buyer or its
Affiliates decline to acquire the Subject Property, Leonard Cherry will have
the right to do so.

(b) During the Restricted Period, Leonard Cherry may sell or lease all or any
part of interests in any real property held by Leonard Cherry and his
Affiliates that contain sand or gravel reserves only after he has first
offered to sell or lease, as applicable, the interest to the Buyer in writing
at a market rate and on and subject to market terms and conditions (a
"Property Offer"). The Buyer or its Affiliates will have 30 days to accept a
Property Offer by written notice to Leonard Cherry. If the Buyer or its
Affiliates do not timely accept a Property Offer, the Buyer will be deemed to
have declined the Property Offer. If the Buyer declines the Property Offer,
Leonard Cherry may, as applicable (i) within six months thereafter lease the
interest to third parties, or (ii) within twelve months thereafter sell the
interest to third parties, in each case on terms equal to or more favorable to
Leonard Cherry than those contained in the Property Offer. If (x) Leonard
Cherry fails to enter into an agreement for the lease of such interest with
third parties within six months after the Buyer declines the Property Offer,
or (y) Leonard Cherry fails to enter into a contract for the sale of such
interest to third parties within six months after the Buyer declines the
Property Offer and thereafter to close such sale within twelve months after
the Buyer declines the



Property Offer, Leonard Cherry shall not be permitted to sell or lease such
interest without again complying with the terms and conditions of this Section
9.10(b).

10.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The
representations and warranties of the Sellers, the Companies and the Buyer
contained in Article V, Article VI, and Article VII, respectively, shall
terminate at, and not survive, the Closing. The covenants of the Sellers, the
Companies and the Buyer contained in this Agreement shall terminate at, and
not survive, the Closing, except for those covenants and agreements that by
their terms contemplate performance in whole or in part after the Closing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the covenants in Section 9.8(h)),
which shall survive the Closing until performed in accordance with their
respective terms.

10.2 Certain Waivers. Except (i) in relation to the Closing Cash Proceeds
adjustment set out in Section 2.3, (ii) with respect to any claims for Fraud
and (iii) the rights or obligations of any Person to the extent arising under
this Agreement, including the covenants set forth herein that contemplate
performance in whole or in part after the Closing and claims pursuant to
Section 9.8(h) (collectively, the "Waiver Exceptions"), from and after the
Closing, the Buyer hereby waives and releases to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, each Seller and such Seller's Related Parties, whether
in any individual, corporate or any other capacity, from and against any and
all other rights, claims and causes of action it may have against such Seller
or any of such Seller's Related Parties relating (directly or indirectly) to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including relating to
any exhibit, Disclosure Schedule or document delivered hereunder), including
whether arising under or based upon any federal, state, local or foreign
statute, Law or ordinance or otherwise, including any rights, claims or causes
of action with respect to any environmental, health or safety matters. The
limits imposed on the Parties' remedies with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including this Section 10.2) were
specifically bargained for between sophisticated parties and were specifically
taken into account in the determination of the amounts to be paid to the
Sellers hereunder. None of the Buyer, its Affiliates, and their respective
officers, directors employees or agents may avoid the limitations on liability
set forth in this Article X by seeking damages for breach of contract, tort or
pursuant to any other theory of liability. Nothing in this Section 10.2 shall
limit the rights of the Parties to obtain specific performance of the other
Parties' obligations hereunder in accordance with Section 11.13 or the Buyer's
rights under the RandW Insurance Policy.

ARTICLE XI 

MISCELLANEOUS

11.1 Press Releases and Communications. No press release or public statement

Representative, unless (a) such press release or other public statement is
consistent in all material respects with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made by a Party in accordance with this
Agreement or (b) required by Law (in the reasonable opinion of counsel) in
which case the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall have the right to

11.5 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by any Party without the prior written consent of the
Buyer and the Sellers; provided, however, that the Buyer may assign this
Agreement to any Affiliate of the Buyer without the prior written consent of
the Sellers, provided, further, that no assignment shall limit the assignor's
obligations hereunder.



11.6 Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim
or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement may
only be brought against, the Persons that are expressly named as Parties to
this Agreement. Except to the extent named as a Party to this Agreement, and
then only to the extent of the specific obligations of such Parties set forth
in this Agreement, no past, present or future shareholder, member, partner,
manager, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, agent or representative of
any Party to this Agreement or of the Companies or any of their respective
Subsidiaries will have any obligation or liability (whether in contract, tort,
equity or otherwise) for any of the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or other obligations or liabilities of any of the Parties to this
Agreement or for any claim based upon, arising out of or related to this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no claim will be brought or
maintained by the Buyer, its Affiliates or representatives, or any of their
respective successors or permitted assigns against any present or future
shareholder, member, partner, manager, director, officer, employee, Affiliate,
agent or representative of any Party to this Agreement which is not otherwise
expressly identified as a Party to this Agreement, and no recourse will be
brought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged
misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach or nonperformance of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of any Party hereto set
forth or contained in this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto or any
certificate delivered hereunder.

11.7 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement, so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party, and upon such a
holding, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

11.8 Construction. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule
of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. The headings of
the sections and paragraphs of this Agreement have been inserted for
convenience of reference only and shall in no way restrict or otherwise modify
any of the terms or provisions hereof. In the event a subject matter is
addressed in more than one representation and warranty in Article IV and/or
Article V, the Buyer shall be entitled to rely only on the most specific
representation and warranty addressing such matter. If the relevance of any
item, information or other matter set forth in any section of the Disclosure
Schedules to any other section of the Disclosure Schedules is reasonably
apparent on its face, then such item, information or other matter shall be
deemed to be disclosed against such other section of the Disclosure Schedules,
regardless of whether such item, information or other matter is actually set
forth (by cross-reference or otherwise) in such other section of the
Disclosure Schedules. The specification of any dollar amount or the inclusion
of any item in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement,
the Disclosure Schedules or exhibits is not intended to imply that the
amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other items,
are or are not required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts or
items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within or
outside of the ordinary course of business or past practice, and no Party
shall use the fact of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion
of any item in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules, or exhibits



in any dispute or controversy between the Parties hereto as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not set forth or included in this Agreement, the
Disclosure Schedules, or exhibits is or is not required to be disclosed
(including whether the amount or items are required to be disclosed as
material or threatened) or is within or outside of the ordinary course of
business or past practice for purposes of this Agreement. In addition, matters
reflected in the Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters
required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Disclosure Schedules. Such
additional matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not
necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. The information
contained in this Agreement, in the Disclosure Schedules, and exhibits hereto
is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information
contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission or agreement by
any Party to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation
of Law or breach of contract).

11.9 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Agreement are
intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the Sellers'
Representative acting on behalf of, the Sellers, and the Sellers'
Representative shall have the right, but not the obligation, to enforce any
obligations of the Buyer under this Agreement. Section 9.4 shall be
enforceable by each of the current and former officers, directors, partners,
managers or similar functionaries of the Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries and their respective heirs and representatives. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing expressed or referred to in this
Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the Parties to this
Agreement and, for purposes of Section 9.4, each of the current and former
officers, directors, partners, managers or similar functionaries of the
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries and their respective heirs and
representatives, any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with
respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the Parties hereto in accordance with this Agreement without notice or
liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of
risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of
the Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon
the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

11.10 Complete Agreement. This Agreement and the other agreements,
instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection
herewith (including the Escrow Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement)
contain the complete agreement between the Parties and supersede any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or between the Parties,
written or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any
way.

11.11 Electronic Delivery; Counterparts. This Agreement and any signed
agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and
any amendments hereto or thereto, may be executed in one or more counterparts,
all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any such
counterpart, to the extent delivered by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar
attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic Delivery")
shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed
counterpart and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as
if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the
request of any Party, each other Party shall re-execute the original form of
this Agreement and deliver such form to all other Parties. No Party shall
raise the use of Electronic Delivery



to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of Electronic
Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each such Party
forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to
lack of authenticity.

11.12 Governing Law; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. All issues and questions concerning
the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of this
Agreement and the exhibits and schedules hereto, and all suits, actions or
other proceedings arising hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or
therewith, whether purporting to be sound in contract or tort, or at law or in
equity, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of Texas (including with respect to the applicable statute of
limitations), without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law
rules or provisions (whether of the State of Texas or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of Texas. The Parties hereto hereby agree and consent to be subject
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts located in Harris
County, Texas (and in each case of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom), and hereby waive the right to assert the lack of personal or
subject matter jurisdiction or improper venue in connection with any such
suit, action or other proceeding. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the
Parties hereto (a) waives the defense of inconvenient forum, (b) agrees not to
commence any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or
any transactions contemplated hereby other than in any such court, and (c)
agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or other proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit or
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Process in any such suit,
action or proceeding may be served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether
within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the
foregoing, each Party agrees that service of process on such Party as provided
in Section 11.4 shall be deemed effective service of process on such Party.
EACH PARTY HEREBY KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY AND WITH AND UPON
THE ADVICE OF COMPETENT COUNSEL IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY LITIGATION, SUIT, ACTION, PROCEEDING, CROSS-CLAIM, OR COUNTERCLAIM IN
ANY COURT (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF,
RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH (i) THIS AGREEMENT OR THE VALIDITY,
PERFORMANCE, INTERPRETATION, COLLECTION OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF, (ii) THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR (iii) THE ACTIONS OF SUCH PARTY IN THE
NEGOTIATION, AUTHORIZATION, EXECUTION, DELIVERY, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE
OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF. EACH PARTY (1) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT
OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (2) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO
HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

11.13 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that money damages or legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for
any such damages. Therefore, it is accordingly agreed that each Party shall be
entitled to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of any other
Party, in any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive
relief shall be granted



in connection therewith. Any Party seeking an injunction, a decree or order of
specific performance shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection therewith and any such remedy shall be in addition to
and not in substitution for any other remedy to which such Party is entitled
at law or in equity.

11.14 Prevailing Party. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, if there
shall occur any dispute or proceeding between the Parties relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, the non-prevailing Party
shall pay all reasonable costs and fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses) of the prevailing Party.

11.15 Acknowledgement. Following the Closing, in any dispute or proceeding
arising under or in connection with, or any other matter related to, this
Agreement, the Sellers' Representative and the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates (individually and collectively, the "Seller Group") shall have the
right, at their respective election, to retain Bradley Arant Boult Cummings
LLP (the "Law Firm") to represent the Seller Group in such matter, and the
Buyer hereby irrevocably waives and consents to (and will cause its
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries) to waive and consent to), any such representation in any such
matter and the communication by such counsel to the Seller Group in connection
with any such representation of any fact known to such counsel arising by
reason of such counsel's prior representation of the Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries. The Buyer irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that
all Attorney-Client Communications would not be subject to disclosure to the
Buyer and its Affiliates in connection with any process relating to a dispute
arising under or in connection with, this Agreement, shall continue after the
Closing and for all purposes be deemed to be privileged communications between
the Law Firm and the Seller Group, and none of the Buyer or its Affiliates
(including, after Closing, the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries)
nor any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through any of the foregoing
shall (a) seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that the
privilege attaching to such communications belongs to the Companies and or any
of their respective Subsidiaries and not to the Seller, (b) take any action
which could cause any Attorney-Client Communication to cease being a
confidential communication or to otherwise lose protection under the attorney-
client privilege or any other evidentiary privilege, including waiving such
protection in any dispute with a Person that is not in the Seller Group, (c)
use or rely on any of the Attorney-Client Communications whether located in
the records or e-mail servers of the Companies or their respective
Subsidiaries, or otherwise, in any action against or involving the Parties
after the Closing, or (d) assert that the privilege has been waived as to the
Attorney-Client Communications that may be located in the records or e-mail
servers of the Companies or their respective Subsidiaries.

11.16 No Right of Set-Off. The Buyer, for itself and its successors and
permitted assigns, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any rights of
set-off, netting, offset, recoupment, or similar rights that the Buyer or any
of its successors and permitted assigns has or may have with respect to the
payment of the Closing Cash Proceeds or any other payments to be made by the
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or any other document or instrument delivered
by the Buyer in connection herewith.



11.17 Relationship of the Parties. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
to constitute the Parties as joint venturers, alter egos, partners or
participants in an unincorporated business or other separate entity, nor in
any manner create any principal agent, fiduciary or other special relationship
between the Parties. No Party shall have any duties (including fiduciary
duties) towards any other Party except as specifically set forth herein.

11.18 Sellers' Representative.

(a) By approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each Seller shall have irrevocably authorized and appointed the
Sellers' Representative as such Person's representative and attorney-in-fact
to act on behalf of such Person with respect to this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, and to take any and all actions and make any decisions required or
permitted to be taken by the Sellers' Representative pursuant to this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, including the exercise of the power to:

(i) give and receive notices and communications;

(ii) authorize release to Buyer of amounts from the Purchase Price Escrow
Account in satisfaction of any amounts owed to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.3;

(iii) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and
comply with orders or otherwise handle any other matters described in Section
2.3;

(iv) execute and deliver all documents necessary or desirable to carry out the
intent of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement;

(v) make all elections or decisions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement;

(vi) engage, employ or appoint any agents or representatives (including
attorneys, accountants and consultants) to assist the Sellers' Representative
in complying with its duties and obligations; and

(vii) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the good faith judgment of
the Sellers' Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing.

(b) The Buyer shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the Sellers'
Representative on all matters relating to this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement and shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence
of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed
on behalf of any Seller by the Sellers' Representative, and on any other
action taken or purported to be taken on behalf of any Seller by the Sellers'
Representative, as being fully binding upon such Person. Notices or
communications to or from the Sellers' Representative shall constitute notice
to or from each of the Sellers. Any decision or action by the Sellers'
Representative hereunder, including any agreement between the Sellers'
Representative and the Buyer relating to the defense, payment or settlement of
any claims for indemnification hereunder, shall constitute a decision or
action of all of the Sellers and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
each such Person.



(c) The Sellers' Representative may resign at any time, and may be removed for
any reason or no reason by the vote or written consent of a majority in
interest of the Sellers according to each Seller's Pro Rata Share (the
"Majority Holders"); provided, however, in no event shall the Sellers'
Representative resign or be removed without the Majority Holders having first
appointed a new Sellers' Representative who shall assume such duties
immediately upon the resignation or removal of the Sellers' Representative. In
the event of the death, incapacity, resignation or removal of the Sellers'
Representative, a new Sellers' Representative shall be appointed by the vote
or written consent of the Majority Holders. Notice of such vote or a copy of
the written consent appointing such new Sellers' Representative shall be sent
to the Buyer, such appointment to be effective upon the later of the date
indicated in such consent or the date such notice is received by the Buyer.

(d) The Sellers' Representative shall not be liable to the Sellers for actions
taken pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, except to the extent
such actions shall have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
to have constituted gross negligence or involved Fraud, intentional misconduct
or bad faith (it being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the
advice of counsel, accountants and other professionals and experts retained by
the Sellers' Representative shall be conclusive evidence of good faith). The
Sellers shall severally and not jointly (in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Shares), indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers' Representative from
and against, compensate the Sellers' Representative for, reimburse it for and
pay any and all losses, liabilities, claims, actions, damages and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, arising out of and in
connection with its activities as the Sellers' Representative under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (the "Representative Losses"), in each case
as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that in the
event it is finally adjudicated that a Representative Loss or any portion
thereof was primarily caused by the gross negligence, Fraud, intentional
misconduct or bad faith of the Sellers' Representative, the Sellers'
Representative shall reimburse the Sellers the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss attributable to such gross negligence, Fraud, intentional
misconduct or bad faith.

(e) The provisions of this Section 11.18, including the power of attorney
granted hereby, are independent and severable, are irrevocable and coupled
with an interest and shall not be terminated by any act of any one or more of
the Sellers, or by operation of Law, whether by death or other event, and will
be enforceable notwithstanding any rights or remedies that the Buyer or any
Seller may have in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

11.19 Buyer Guarantor.

(a) The Buyer Guarantor hereby unconditionally, absolutely, continuingly and
irrevocably guarantees to the Sellers the timely payment and performance by
the Buyer of all of the obligations and liabilities of the Buyer arising under
or in connection with this Agreement. The Buyer Guarantor further agrees that
if the Buyer shall fail to pay in full when due any of the Buyer's obligations
hereunder, the Buyer Guarantor shall promptly pay the same, at the place and
in the manner specified herein. The Buyer Guarantor's liabilities shall in no
way be impaired, affected, reduced or released by reason of (i) the failure or
delay by any Seller or any other person in pursuing any remedies or recourse
against the Buyer provided for in this Agreement; or (ii) the voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale or other disposition of all or
substantially all the assets of the Buyer or the marshalling of assets and
liabilities, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit
of creditors, reorganization,



arrangement, composition with creditors or readjustment of, or other similar
proceedings or any other inability to pay or perform affecting, the Buyer or
any of its assets.

(b) The Buyer Guarantor is a corporation duly incorporated and validly
existing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Buyer Guarantor has all
requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Buyer Guarantor of this Agreement have been duly and
validly authorized by the Buyer Guarantor, and no other corporate act or
proceeding on the part of the Buyer Guarantor, its board of directors or its
shareholders is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery or performance
of this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Buyer Guarantor, and this Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding
obligation of the Buyer Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with its terms
except as enforceability may be limited or affected by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other Laws of general application relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors and except as enforceability may be limited
by rules of Law governing specific performance, injunctive relief or other
equitable remedies.

SPOUSAL CONSENT

I, Regina Sue Cherry, spouse of Leonard L. Cherry, acknowledge that I have
read the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated December 12, 2019, to which this
Consent is attached (the "Agreement"), and that I know the contents of the
Agreement. I am aware that the Agreement contains provisions regarding the
sale of my spouse's shares of capital stock in Cherry Industries, Inc. and
4601 Holmes Road Corporation, including any interest I might have therein.

I hereby agree that my interest, if any, in any shares of capital stock of
such corporations shall be irrevocably bound by the Agreement, and I further
understand and agree that any community property interest I may have in such
shares of capital stock of such corporations shall be similarly bound by the
Agreement.

I am aware that the legal, financial and related matters contained in the
Agreement are complex and that I am free to seek independent professional
guidance or counsel with respect to this Consent. I have either sought such
guidance or counsel or determined after reviewing the Agreement carefully that
