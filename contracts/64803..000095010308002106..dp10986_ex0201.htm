ARTICLE 2

 

The Offer

 

 

Section 2.01. The Offer. (a) Provided that nothing shall have occurred and
be continuing that, had the Offer been commenced, would give rise to a right
to terminate the Offer pursuant to any of the conditions set forth in Annex
I, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof and in any event within
ten calendar days after the date hereof, Merger Subsidiary shall commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the 1934 Act) the Offer to purchase
any and all of the outstanding Shares at the Offer Price, net to the seller
in cash. The Offer shall only be subject to the condition that there shall
be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer, prior to the
expiration date of the Offer and not withdrawn, a number of Shares
that, together with the Shares then owned by Parent and/or Merger
Subsidiary, represents at least two-thirds of the total number of Shares
outstanding on a fully diluted basis (the "Minimum Condition") and to the
other conditions set forth in Annex I. Merger Subsidiary expressly reserves
the right to waive any of the conditions to the Offer and to make any change
in the terms of or conditions to the Offer; provided that, without the prior
consent of the Company, (i) the Minimum Condition may not be waived and (ii)
no change may be made that changes the form of consideration to be paid,
decreases the Offer Price or the number of Shares sought in the Offer,
imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex I or
modifies the conditions set forth in Annex I or amends any other term of the
Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of Shares. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (x) without the consent of the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Company, Merger Subsidiary shall have the right to extend the Offer for any
period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the
SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer or any period required by
Applicable Law and (y) if any condition to the Offer is not satisfied or
waived on any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, Merger Subsidiary shall
extend the Offer from time to time until such conditions are satisfied or
waived; provided, in each case, that Merger Subsidiary shall not be required
to extend the Offer beyond the End Date. Following expiration of the Offer,
Merger Subsidiary may, in its sole discretion, provide a subsequent offering
period ("Subsequent Offering Period") in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the
1934 Act. Merger Subsidiary shall not terminate or withdraw the Offer other
than in connection with the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article 11 hereof. Subject to the foregoing, including the requirements of
Rule 14d-11, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer,
Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause it to, accept for payment and
pay for, as promptly as practicable after the expiration of the Offer, all
Shares (i) validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and (ii)
validly tendered in the Subsequent Offering Period (the time at which Shares
are first accepted for payment under the Offer, the "Acceptance Time").

 

 

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule
TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto and including exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO") that shall
include the summary term sheet required thereby and, as exhibits, the Offer
to Purchase and a form of letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and
other appropriate ancillary Offer documents (collectively, together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "Offer Documents") and (ii) cause the
Offer Documents, along with the notice of the Merger required by Section
3-106(d)(1) of Maryland Law (the "Notice of Merger"), to be disseminated to
holders of Shares. Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company agrees
promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
TO, the Offer Documents or the Notice of Merger if and to the extent that
such information shall have become (or shall become known to be) false or
misleading in any material respect. Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule TO as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents as so corrected to be disseminated
to holders of Shares, in each case, as soon as reasonably practicable and as
and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws. The
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents each time before any such
document is filed with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the Company
and its counsel. Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall provide the Company
and its counsel with (i) any comments or other communications, whether
written or oral, that Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule TO or Offer Documents promptly after receipt of those
comments or other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the response of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to those comments
and to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith
consideration shall be given).

 

 

Section 2.02. Company Action. (a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer
and represents that the Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held
has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable and in
the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) adopted this
Agreement and approved the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the requirements of Maryland Law,
(iii) resolved, subject to Section 7.04(b), to recommend acceptance of the
Offer and, if required by Applicable Law, approval of the Merger by its
stockholders and (iv) taken all other actions necessary to exempt the Offer,
the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby from any
"fair price", "moratorium", "control share acquisition", "interested
stockholder", "business combination" or other similar statute or regulation
promulgated by a Governmental Authority ("Takeover Statute"). The Company
has been advised that all of its directors and executive officers who own
Shares intend to tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer. The Company shall
promptly furnish Parent with a list of its stockholders, mailing labels and
any available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of
all record holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held
in stock depositories, in each case, true and correct as of the most recent
practicable date, and shall provide to Parent such additional information
(including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of
securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably
request in connection with the Offer.

 

 

(b) On the day that the Offer is commenced, the Company shall file with the
SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case, as and to the extent
required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws, a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that, subject to
Section 7.04(b), shall reflect the recommendations of the Board of Directors
referred to above. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary agrees
promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to
be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case, as soon as
reasonably practicable and as and to the extent required by applicable U.S.
federal securities laws. Parent and its

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Schedule 14D-9 each time before it is filed with the SEC, and the
Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their counsel. The Company
shall provide Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their counsel with (i) any
comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that the Company
or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of those comments or
other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
Company's response to those comments and to provide comments on that response
(to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given).

 

 

Section 2.03. Directors. (a) Effective upon the Acceptance Time, Parent
shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the
next whole number, on the Board of Directors that equals the product of (i)
the total number of directors on the Board of Directors (giving effect to the
election of any additional directors pursuant to this Section) and (ii) the
percentage that the number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent and/or
Merger Subsidiary (including Shares accepted for payment) bears to the total
number of Shares outstanding, and the Company shall cause Parent's designees
to be elected or appointed to the Board of Directors, including by increasing
the number of directors and seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent
directors. At such time, the Company shall also cause individuals designated
by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the next whole
number, on (A) each committee of the Board of Directors and (B) as requested
by Parent, each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company (and
each committee thereof) that represents the same percentage as such
individuals represent on the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, until the Acceptance Time, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to ensure that all of the members of the Board of Directors and
such committees and boards as of the date hereof who are not employees of the
Company shall remain members of the Board of Directors and such committees
and boards until the Effective Time.

 

 

(b) The Company's obligations to appoint Parent's designees to the Board of
Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the 1934 Act and Rule
14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all
actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with
respect to the Company and its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1 require in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section.
Parent shall supply to the Company in writing and be solely responsible for
any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors
and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 and the Company's
obligations under Section 2.03(b) shall be subject to the receipt of such
information.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parent's designees pursuant to
Section 2.03(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of
the directors of the Company then in office who were not designated by Parent
(the "Independent Directors") shall be required to authorize (and such
authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Board of Directors
and no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any
other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) any
termination of this Agreement by the Company, any amendment of this Agreement
requiring action by the Board of Directors, any extension of time for
performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger
Subsidiary and any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company.

 

 

Section 2.04. Top-Up Option. (a) Subject to Section 2.04(b) and
Section 2.04(c), the Company grants to Merger Subsidiary an irrevocable
option, for so long as this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to the
provisions hereof (the "Top-Up Option"), to purchase from the Company up to
the number of authorized and unissued Shares equal to the number of Shares
that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Merger Subsidiary at the
time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one Share more than the
number of Shares (the "Requisite Short-Form Merger Shares") entitled to cast
90% of all the votes entitled to be cast by each group or class of shares
entitled to vote as a group or class on the Merger after the issuance of all
Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, calculated on a
fully-diluted basis or, as may be elected by Parent, on a primary basis at
the Effective Time (such Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option, the "Top-Up Shares").

 

 

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Subsidiary, in whole or in
part, only once, at any time during the ten Business Day period following the
Acceptance Time, or if any Subsequent Offering Period is provided, during the
ten Business Day period following the expiration date of the Subsequent
Offering Period, and only if Merger Subsidiary shall own as of such time less
than the Requisite Short-Form Merger Shares; provided that notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Top-Up Option shall not be
exercisable to the extent (i) the issuance of the Top-Up Shares would require
approval of the Company's stockholders under Rule 312 of The New York Stock
Exchange (the "NYSE") (unless a waiver or exemption therefrom is obtained
from the NYSE), (ii) the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of the Top-
Up Option would exceed the number of authorized but unissued Shares or (iii)
any other provision of Applicable Law or judgment, injunction, order or
decree shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of
the Top-Up Shares. The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up
Shares being purchased by Merger Subsidiary pursuant to the Top-Up Option
shall be determined by multiplying the number of such Shares by the Offer
Price, without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest. Such purchase price may be paid by Merger Subsidiary, at its
election, either entirely in cash or by executing and delivering to the
Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to such purchase
price. Any such promissory note shall bear interest at the rate of 3% per
annum, shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and
delivery of such promissory note and may be prepaid without premium or
penalty.

 

 

(c) In the event Merger Subsidiary wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option,
Merger Subsidiary shall deliver to the Company a notice (the "Top-
Up Notice") setting forth (i) the number of Top-Up Shares that
Merger Subsidiary intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii)
the manner in which Merger Subsidiary intends to pay the applicable purchase
price and (iii) the place and time at which the closing of the purchase of
such Top-Up Shares by Merger Subsidiary is to take place. The Top-Up Notice
shall also include an undertaking signed by Parent and Merger
Subsidiary that, as promptly as practicable following such exercise of the
Top-Up Option, Merger Subsidiary intends to (and Merger Subsidiary shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary to, as promptly as practicable after
such exercise) consummate the Merger in accordance with Section 3-106 of
Maryland Law and as contemplated by Section 9.06. At the closing of the
purchase of the Top-Up Shares, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall cause to be
delivered to the Company the consideration required to be delivered in
exchange for the Top-Up Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued to
Merger Subsidiary a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares. The parties
hereto agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the closing of the
purchase of the Top-Up Shares to occur on the same day that the Top-Up Notice
is deemed received by the Company pursuant to Section 12.01, and if not so
consummated on such day, as promptly thereafter as possible. The parties
further agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be
consummated in accordance with Section 3-106 of Maryland Law and as
contemplated by Section 9.06 as close in time as possible to (including, to
the extent possible, on the same day as) the issuance of the Top-Up Shares.

 

 

(d) Parent and Merger Subsidiary understand that the Top-Up Shares will not
be registered under the 1933 Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Each
of Parent and Merger Subsidiary represents, warrants and agrees that the Top-
Up Option is being, and the Top-Up Shares will be, acquired by Merger
Subsidiary for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale
in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the 1933
Act. Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Shares shall include any legends
required by applicable securities laws.

 

 

(e)  Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assist and cooperate with each other in doing, all things necessary or
desirable to procure from the NYSE or any other Governmental Authority any
necessary waiver or other exemption from the requirements of NYSE Rule 312 or
other Applicable Law in order to enable the issuance of the Top-Up Shares to
occur without the need to obtain the approval of holders of a majority of the
Shares present and voting at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

 

 

ARTICLE 3

 

The Merger

 

 

Section 3.01. The Merger. (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall
be merged with and into the Company in accordance with Maryland Law,
whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the
Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

 

 

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 10, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place in New York City at the offices of Davis Polk and
Wardwell, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 as soon as
possible, but in any event no earlier than 30 days after the date of the
Notice of Merger and no later than two Business Days after the date the
conditions set forth in Article 10 (other than conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction
or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing)
have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or
parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place,
at such other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree.

 

 

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file articles of
merger with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland and
make all other filings or recordings required by Maryland Law in connection
with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the
"Effective Time") as the articles of merger are duly accepted by the
State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland or at such later
time as may be specified in the articles of merger.

 

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Maryland Law.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 3.02. Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or
the Company:

 

 

(a) except as otherwise provided in Section 3.02(b) or Section 3.02(c), each
Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted automatically into the right to receive the Offer Price, in cash
without interest (the "Merger Consideration");

 

 

(b) each Share held by any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into such number of shares of stock of the
Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage
of the outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time;

 

 

(c) each Share owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto; and

 

 

(d) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation (except for
any such shares resulting from the conversion of Shares pursuant to Section
3.02(b)).

 

 

Section 3.03. Surrender and Payment. (a) Prior to the Acceptance Time,
Parent shall appoint an agent that has been approved in advance by the
Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the
Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing Shares (the
"Certificates") or (ii) uncertificated Shares (the "Uncertificated Shares").
Parent or one of its Subsidiaries shall make available to the Exchange Agent,
as needed, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates
and the Uncertificated Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of
Shares at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which
shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

 

 

(b) Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to
the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed
letter of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent
(or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, the Merger Consideration payable for each Share represented by a
Certificate or for each Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated
Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 

 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 3.

 

 

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 3.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares six months after the
Effective Time shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation upon demand,
and any such holder who has not exchanged such Shares for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.03 prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of such Shares without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Exchange
Agent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall be
liable to any holder of Shares for any amount paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares two years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the
property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

 

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 3.03(a) to pay for Shares for which appraisal

appraisal rights shall be available with respect to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

Section 3.05. Stock Options, Performance Shares and Restricted Shares. (a)
At the Acceptance Time, each then-outstanding option to purchase Shares
granted under any employee stock option or compensation plan or arrangement
of the Company (a "Company Stock Option"), whether or not vested or
exercisable, shall be converted into the right to receive, and the Company
shall pay to each former holder of any such converted Company Stock Option at
or promptly after the Acceptance Time an amount in cash equal to the product
of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable
exercise price per Share of such Company Stock Option and (ii) the number of
Shares such holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting of such
Company Stock Option) had such holder exercised such Company Stock Option in
full immediately prior to the Acceptance Time.

 

 

(b) At the Acceptance Time, each then-outstanding right to earn a restricted
Share under the Company's performance-based restricted stock grant program (a
"Performance Share") shall be deemed earned (i) at maximum, if such
Performance Share relates to the 2008/2009 performance cycle, and (ii)
target, if such Performance Share relates to the 2009/2010 performance cycle;
provided, however, that the portion of such 2009/2010 performance award that
is not dependent solely on the Company's performance in 2009 shall be
prorated by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days, elapsed
between February 1, 2008 and the Acceptance Time and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the full 2009/2010 performance cycle. Earned
Performance Shares shall be fully vested and converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration at the Acceptance Time, and any Performance
Shares not earned in accordance with the foregoing shall be cancelled without
consideration.

 

 

(c) At the Acceptance Time, each then-outstanding restricted Share granted
under any equity or compensation plan or arrangement of the Company (a
"Company Restricted Share") shall vest (and all restrictions thereon
shall immediately lapse) and shall be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.02(a).

 

 

(d) The Company shall pay the holders of Company Stock Options and
Performance Shares the cash payments described in this Section 3.05 as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Acceptance Time, but in any event no
later than the earlier of (i) the Company's next payroll cycle occurring
after the five-day

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period following the Acceptance Time or (ii) ten Business Days following
the Acceptance Time.

 

 

Section 3.06. Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares shall be changed
into a different number of shares or a different class, including by reason
of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination,
exchange or readjustment of Shares, or stock dividend thereon with a record
date during such period, but excluding any change that results from any
exercise of Company Stock Options, the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration
and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be
appropriately adjusted.

 

 

Section 3.07. Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to Articles 2 and 3 such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of Tax law, and if any such amounts are deducted and withheld, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall timely pay such
amounts over to the appropriate Government Authority. If the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the
case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

 

 

Section 3.08. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
completion of the letter of transmittal by such Person and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the Shares represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article
3.

the State of Maryland, has all corporate powers and has, and has had at all
relevant times, all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents
and approvals ("Permits") required to carry on its business as now

Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary,

Company of the transactions contemplated hereby are within the Company's
corporate powers and, except for the affirmative vote of the holders of two-
thirds of the outstanding Shares in connection with the consummation of the
Merger (if required by Applicable Law), have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The affirmative vote
of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote
thereon (if required by Applicable Law) is the only vote of the holders of
any of the Company's capital stock necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Merger. Assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery hereof by Parent and Merger Subsidiary, this Agreement constitutes a
valid and binding agreement of the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms
(subject, in the case of enforceability, to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws
affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity).

 

 

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Board of Directors has (i)

performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority, other than (i) the

extent applicable (the "Healthcare Regulatory Approvals"), (v) applicable
requirements of the rules and regulations of the NYSE, (vi) actions required
by the Nevada Gaming Commission and the Nevada State Gaming Control Board and
(vii) any actions or filings the absence of which would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section 5.04. Non-contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of any provision of the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (ii) assuming compliance with the

a violation or breach of any provision of any Applicable Law, (iii) assuming

with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default,
under, or cause or permit the termination, cancellation, acceleration or
other change of any right or obligation or the loss of any benefit to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of any
agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any license, franchise, permit, certificate, approval or
other similar authorization affecting, or relating in any way to, the assets
or business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (iv) result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, with only such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (ii)
through (iv), as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section 5.05. Capitalization. (a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of (i) 120,000,000 Shares and (ii) 30,000,000 shares of

organized, is validly existing and (where applicable) in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, has all organizational powers
and has, and has had at all relevant times, all Permits required to carry on
its business as now conducted, except for those Permits the absence of which
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Each such Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification
is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. All material Subsidiaries of the Company and their respective
jurisdictions of organization are identified in the Company 10-K.

 

 

(b) All of the outstanding capital stock of, or other voting securities or
ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company is owned by the
Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien and free of any
other limitation or restriction (including any restriction on the right to

or other voting securities of or ownership interests in any Subsidiary of the
Company, (ii) warrants, calls, options or other rights to acquire from the

exchangeable for any capital stock or other voting securities of or ownership
interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company or (iii) restricted shares, stock

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appreciation rights, performance units, contingent value rights, "phantom"
stock or similar securities or rights that are derivative of, or provide
economic benefits based, directly or indirectly, on the value or price of,
any capital stock of, or other voting securities of or ownership interests
in, any Subsidiary of the Company (the items in clauses (i) through (iii)
being referred to collectively as the "Company Subsidiary Securities").
There are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the Company
Subsidiary Securities. Except for the capital stock or other equity or voting
interests of its Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock or other equity or voting interests in any
Person.

 

 

Section 5.07. SEC Filings and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. (a) The Company has
filed with or furnished to the SEC, and made available to Parent, all
reports, schedules, forms, statements, prospectuses, registration statements
and other documents required to be filed or furnished by the Company since
January 1, 2005 (collectively, together with any exhibits and schedules
thereto and other information incorporated therein, the "Company SEC
Documents").

 

 

(b) As of its filing date (and as of the date of any amendment), each Company
SEC Document complied, and each Company SEC Document filed subsequent to the
date hereof will comply, as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act, as the case may be.

 

 

(c) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each Company SEC Document filed
pursuant to the 1934 Act did not, and each Company SEC Document filed
subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.

 

 

(d) Each Company SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended
or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the 1933 Act, as of the
date such registration statement or amendment became effective, did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading.

 

 

(e) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act). Such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made
known to the Company's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the 1934 Act are being
prepared. Such disclosure controls and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures are effective in timely alerting the Company's principal executive
officer and principal financial officer to material information required to
be included in the Company's periodic and current reports required under the
1934 Act. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and
"principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms
in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 

 

(f) The Company has established and maintained a system of internal controls
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act)
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the
Company's financial reporting and the preparation of Company financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to
the date hereof, to the Company's auditors and audit committee (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in internal
controls. The Company has made available to Parent a summary of any such
disclosure made by management to the Company's auditors and audit committee
since January 1, 2005.

 

 

(g) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any executive officer (as defined in
Rule 3b-7 under the 1934 Act) or director of the Company. The Company has
not, since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, taken any action
prohibited by Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 

 

(h) The Company has complied in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the New York
Stock Exchange.

 

 

(i) Each of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer
of the Company (or each former principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company, as applicable) have made all certifications
required by Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the 1934 Act and Sections 302 and
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC and the NYSE, and the statements contained in any such
certifications are complete and correct.

 

 

Section 5.08. Financial Statements. The audited consolidated financial
statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of the
Company included or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Documents
fairly present, in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
(except as

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may be indicated in the notes thereto), the consolidated financial position
of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and
their consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments in the case of any
unaudited interim financial statements).

 

 

Section 5.09. Disclosure Documents. (a) Each document required to be filed
by the Company with the SEC or required to be distributed or otherwise
disseminated to the Company's stockholders in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure
Documents"), including the Schedule 14D-9, the proxy or information statement
of the Company (the "Company Proxy Statement"), if any, to be filed with the
SEC in connection with the Merger, and any amendments or supplements thereto,
when filed, distributed or disseminated, as applicable, will comply as to
form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the 1934
Act.

 

 

(b) (i) The Company Proxy Statement, as supplemented or amended, if
applicable, at the time such Company Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the
time such stockholders vote on approval of the Merger and at the Effective
Time, and (ii) Company Disclosure Document (other than the Company Proxy
Statement), at the time of the filing of such Company Disclosure Document or
any supplement or amendment thereto and at the time of any distribution or
dissemination thereof, will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The representations and warranties contained in
this Section 5.09(b) will not apply to statements or omissions included in
the Company Disclosure Documents based upon information furnished to the
Company in writing by Parent or Merger Subsidiary specifically for use
therein.

 

 

(c) The information with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that the Company furnishes to Parent or Merger Subsidiary in writing
specifically for use in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, at the time
of the filing of the Schedule TO, at the time of any distribution or
dissemination of the Offer Documents and at the time of the consummation of
the Offer, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

 

 

Section 5.10. Absence of Certain Changes. (a) Since the Company Balance
Sheet Date, the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been
conducted in the ordinary course consistent with past practices in all
material respects and there has not been any event, occurrence, development
or state of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances or facts that has had or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(b) Since the Company Balance Sheet Date through the date hereof, (i) there
has not been any action taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that,
if such action had been taken during the period from the date of this
Agreement through the Effective Time without Parent's consent, would
constitute a breach of Section 7.01(b), (g), (h), (i), (m)(ii) or (n) and
(ii) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have settled any matter
referenced in clauses (A), (B) or (C) of Section 7.01(m).

 

 

Section 5.11. No Undisclosed Material Liabilities. There are no
material liabilities or obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined,
determinable or otherwise, that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on
a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries (or in the
notes thereto) other than (a) liabilities or obligations disclosed in or
reflected or reserved against in the Company's consolidated balance sheet or
in the notes thereto included in the Company's most recent 10-Q filed prior
to the date of this Agreement and (b) liabilities or obligations incurred in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices since the date
of the Company's consolidated balance sheet included in the Company's most
recent 10-Q filed prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

 

Section 5.12. Compliance with Laws and Court Orders. The Company and each of
its Subsidiaries is and has been in compliance with, and to the knowledge of
the Company is not under investigation with respect to and has not been
threatened to be charged with or given notice of any violation of, any
Applicable Law, except for failures to comply or violations that would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section 5.13. Litigation. There is no material action, suit, arbitration,
investigation or proceeding (or any reasonable basis therefor) pending
against, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or
affecting, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties, or, to the actual knowledge of the Company, threatened against or
affecting, any current or former officer, director or employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any Person for whom the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries may be liable, before (or, in the case of threatened actions,
suits, investigations or proceedings, that would be before) or by any
Governmental Authority (including any of the Food and Drug Administration,
Department of Health and Human Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration,
state Medicaid agencies, state pharmacy boards and other federal or state
Governmental Authorities with jurisdiction over the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispensing or distribution of pharmaceutical products or over the provision
of health care items or services) or arbitrator.

 

 

Section 5.14. Regulatory Compliance.

 

 

(a) The Permits of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries are valid and in
full force and effect, and no violation or default exists under any such
Permit, except where the failure to hold any such Permit, the invalidity of
such Permit or the existence of any such violation or default would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Assuming all Healthcare Regulatory Approvals are
obtained, the Merger, in and of itself, would not cause the revocation or
cancellation of any Permit except where the revocation or cancellation of
such Permit would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written
notice from any Governmental Authority that (i) alleges any material
noncompliance (or that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is under
investigation or the subject of an inquiry by any such Governmental Authority
for such alleged material noncompliance) with any Applicable Law, (ii)
asserts any material risk-based capital deficiency or (iii) would be
reasonably likely to result in a material fine, assessment or cease and
desist order, or the suspension, revocation or material limitation or
restriction of any material Permit. Since August 1, 2003, (A) neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any agreement or
settlement with any Governmental Authority with respect to its material non-
compliance with, or material violation of, any Applicable Law and (B) to the
knowledge of the Company, no such agreement or settlement has been in effect.

 

 

(c) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries, and to the knowledge of
Company, all officers and directors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, are in material compliance with, to the extent applicable, (i)
all laws, rules and regulations of the Medicare and Medicaid programs,
including the Medicare Part D program and Medicare Advantage program, any
guidance interpreting such laws rules and regulations, and any other federal
health care program; (ii) all federal laws, rules, regulations and applicable

Section 5.16. Employee Benefit Plans. (a) Schedule 5.16(a) contains a

sharing, stock option or other stock-related rights or other forms of
incentive or deferred compensation, vacation benefits, insurance (including

the Company or any Subsidiary and covers any employee or former employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or with respect to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries has any liability, whether current or contingent.
Copies of such plans (and, if applicable, related trust or funding agreements
or insurance policies) and all amendments thereto and written
interpretations thereof have been furnished or made available to Parent
together with the most recent annual report (Form 5500 including, if
applicable, Schedule B thereto) and tax return (Form 990) prepared in
connection with any such plan or trust. Such plans are referred to
collectively herein as the "Employee Plans."

 

 

(b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary nor any predecessor thereof
sponsors, maintains or contributes to, or has in the six years prior to the
date hereof sponsored, maintained or contributed to, any single employer or
multiple employer plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.

 

 

(c) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary nor any predecessor thereof

31  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Multiemployer Plan"), or any multiple employer welfare arrangement, as

of the Code has received a favorable determination letter, or has pending or
has time remaining in which to file, an application for such determination
from the Internal Revenue Service, and the Company is not aware of any reason
why any such determination letter would reasonably be expected to be revoked
or not be issued. The Company has made available to Parent copies of the
most recent Internal Revenue Service determination letters with respect to
each such Employee Plan. Each Employee Plan has been maintained in
material compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by
any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including ERISA and the
Code, which are applicable to such Employee Plan. No material events have
occurred with respect to any Employee Plan that could result in payment by or
assessment or Lien against the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates of any
material excise taxes under Sections 417, 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4979,

vesting or trigger any payment of funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of compensation or benefits (including acceleration of vesting or
exercise of an incentive award) under, increase the amount payable or trigger
any other material obligation pursuant to, any Employee Plan. There is
no contract, plan or arrangement (written or otherwise) covering any employee
or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that,
individually or collectively, would entitle any employee or former employee
to any severance or other payment solely as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby, or could give rise to the payment of any amount that
would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 280G of the Code.
Section 5.16(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all the agreements,
arrangements and other instruments which give rise to an obligation to make
or set aside in a trust or other funding vehicle amounts payable to or on
behalf of the officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as a result of the

termination (whether by the Company or the officer), true and complete copies

(i) There is no action, suit, investigation, audit or proceeding pending
against or involving or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against

(j) Since the Company Balance Sheet Date and through the date hereof, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has effectuated or announced (i) a
"plant closing" (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any site of employment
or one or more facilities or operating units within any site of employment or
facility of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) a "mass layoff" (as

under the 1934 Act (the approvals referred to above, the
"Compensation Arrangement Approvals"). The Board of Directors has
determined that the Compensation Committee is composed solely of "independent

unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. No information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any
investigation pursuant to this Section shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder. Nothing
contained in this Section 7.03 shall, prior to the Acceptance Time, require
the Company to take any action that would, in the good faith judgment of the
Company, constitute a waiver of the attorney client or similar privilege or
trade secret protection held by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Company shall make a good
faith effort to accommodate any request from Parent for access or information
pursuant to this Section in a manner that does not result in such a waiver.

 

 

Section 7.04. No Solicitation; Change of Recommendation. (a)
General Prohibitions. Subject to Section 7.04(b), neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of its or their Representatives
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or take any action to
facilitate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish
any information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company

knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by any
Third Party that is seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the
Company Board Recommendation (or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or
take any action or make any statement inconsistent with the Company
Board Recommendation) (any of the foregoing in this clause (iii), an
"Adverse Recommendation Change"), (iv) grant any waiver or release under
any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity
securities of the Company

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or any of its Subsidiaries, (v) approve any transaction, or any Person
becoming an "interested stockholder", under Section 3-603 of Maryland Law, or
exempt any transaction or Person from any other Antitakeover Statute, or (vi)
enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger
agreement, purchase agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument
relating to an Acquisition Proposal. It is agreed that, subject to Section
7.04(b), any violation of the restrictions on the Company set forth in this
Section by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall
be a breach of this Section by the Company.

 

 

(b) Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 7.04(a), at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time:

 

 

(i) the Company, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or
other intermediaries, may (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with any
Third Party and its Representatives that, subject to the Company's compliance
with Section 7.04(a), has made a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the
Board of Directors reasonably believes will lead to a Superior Proposal and
(B) furnish to such Third Party or its Representatives non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement with such Third Party with terms no less favorable
to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement;
provided that all such information (to the extent that such information has
not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made
available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such Third
Party); and

 

 

(ii) following receipt of such Superior Proposal, (A) the Board of Directors
may make an Adverse Recommendation Change and (B) concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.01(d)(ii), take the
actions set forth in Sections 7.04(a)(v) and 7.04(a)(vi);

 

 

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) only if the
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the statutory duty of the members of the Board of Directors, as
directors, under Maryland Law.

 

 

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors
from (A) complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, so
long as any action taken or statement made to so comply is consistent with
this Section 7.04 (provided that any such action taken or statement made that
relates to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation
Change unless the Board of Directors reaffirms the Company Board
Recommendation in such statement or in connection with such action) or (B)
issuing a "stop, look and listen" disclosure or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act.

 

 

(c) Required Notices. The Board of Directors shall not take any of
the actions referred to in Section 7.04(b) unless the Company shall have
delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to
take such action, and, after taking such action, the Company shall continue
to advise Parent on a current basis of the status and terms of any
discussions and negotiations with the Third Party. In addition, the Company
shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after
receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition
Proposal, any inquiry or request for discussion from a Third Party regarding
an Acquisition Proposal or any request for information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties,
assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any
Third Party that may be considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall provide such notice orally and in writing and
shall identify the Third Party making, and the terms and conditions of, any
such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, and shall promptly (but in
no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of all
correspondence and written materials sent or provided to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that describe any terms or conditions of any Acquisition
Proposal. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed
to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of the Company's compliance
with this Section 7.04(c).

 

 

(d) "Last Look". Further, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not
make an Adverse Recommendation Change, unless (i) it has received
an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, (ii) the
Company promptly notifies Parent in writing at least five Business Days
before taking that action of its intention to do so, attaching the most
current version of the proposed agreement under which such Superior Proposal
is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the third party making the
Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) Parent does not make, within five Business
Days after its receipt of that written notification, an offer that is at
least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Superior
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial
terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
written notification from the Company and a new five Business Day period
under this Section 7.04(d)).

 

 

(e) Termination Right. If, prior to the Acceptance Time, the Board
of Directors shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change in compliance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the terms of this Agreement (including Section 7.04(d)), the Company
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement so long as (i) at least 20
Business Days have elapsed from the date the Company publicly announced such
Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) at least 20 Business Days have elapsed
from the date the Third Party making such Superior Proposal publicly
announced any material amendment to any of the terms or conditions of such
Superior Proposal (it being understood that any change to the financial terms
shall be deemed a material amendment), (iii) at least 10 Business Days have
elapsed from the date of any bona fide increase by Parent of the Offer Price
with a view to satisfying the Minimum Condition and (iv) the Minimum
Condition is not satisfied; provided that, simultaneously with any
termination pursuant to this Section 7.04(e), the Company shall pay the
amount due pursuant to Section 12.04(b) in connection with such termination.

 

 

(f) Definition of Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Superior Proposal" means a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal for at least a majority of the outstanding Shares on terms that the
Board of Directors determines in good faith by a majority vote, after
considering the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel and taking into account all the terms
and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees,
expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation, are more
favorable and provide greater value to all of the Company's stockholders than
as provided hereunder (taking into account any proposal by Parent to amend
the terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.04(d)) which the Board of
Directors determines is reasonably likely to be consummated without undue
delay relative to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
for which financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in part), is
then fully committed or reasonably determined to be available by the Board
of Directors.

 

 

(g) Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions, Etc. The Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to,
cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and
its Representatives conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly request that each Third
Party, if any, that has executed a confidentiality agreement within
the 24-month period prior to the date hereof that is still in effect in
accordance with the terms thereof in connection with its consideration of any
Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (and all analyses and other materials prepared by or on
behalf of such Person that contains, reflects or analyzes that information)
in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement. The Company
shall

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use its reasonable best efforts to secure certifications of such return or
destruction from such other Persons as promptly as practicable.

 

 

Section 7.05. Compensation Arrangements. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company (acting through its Compensation Committee) will take all steps that
may be necessary or advisable to cause each Compensation Arrangement entered
into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or, subject to the
restrictions contained in this Agreement, after the date hereof to be
approved by the Compensation Committee (comprised solely of "independent
directors" determined in the manner described in the last sentence of Section
5.16(k)) as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the 1934 Act and
to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in
Rule 14d−10(d) of the 1934 Act.

Shares beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of
approval of the Merger at the Company Stockholder Meeting, unless Maryland
Law does not require a vote of stockholders of the Company for consummation
of the Merger.

 

 

Section 8.03. Director and Officer Liability. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do
the following:

 

 

(a) For six years after the Acceptance Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each current and former
officer, director, trustee, member, fiduciary and agent of the Company and
its Affiliates and each person who served as a fiduciary under or with
respect to any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
ERISA) (each, together with such person's heirs, executors or administrators,
an "Indemnified Person") against any costs or expenses (including advancing
attorneys' fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any
claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Person to the
fullest extent permitted by

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Applicable Law; provided, however, that such advance shall be conditioned
upon the Surviving Company's receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the
Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall be ultimately determined
by final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that the Indemnified
Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 8.03(a)),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit,
arbitration, proceeding or investigation in respect of or arising out of acts
or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the
Acceptance Time to the fullest extent permitted by Maryland Law or any other
Applicable Law or provided under the Company's articles of incorporation and
bylaws in effect on the date hereof; provided that such indemnification shall
be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under Applicable Law.
In the event of any such action, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
cooperate with the Indemnified Person in the defense of any such action.

 

 

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to continue in full force
and effect for a period of six years from the Acceptance Time the provisions
in existence in the Company's and its Subsidiaries' articles of incorporation
and bylaws and other organizational documents in effect on the date of this
Agreement regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification
and exculpation of officers, directors and employees and advancement of
expenses.

 

 

(c) For six years after the Acceptance Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide officers' and directors' liability,
fiduciary liability and similar insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance") of
the Company in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Acceptance
Time covering each Indemnified Person currently covered by the Company's DandO
Insurance policies on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof as well as
covering claims brought against each Indemnified Person under ERISA (or a
six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable
to Parent providing coverage, benefits and terms no less favorable to the
Indemnified Persons than the Company's current such policy as well
as covering claims brought against each Indemnified Person under ERISA; for
the avoidance of doubt, the Company may purchase such "tail policy" at its
option prior to the Acceptance Time, and, in such case, Parent shall cause
such policy to be in full force and effect for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation);
provided that, in satisfying its obligation under this Section 8.03(c), the
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual amounts in the
aggregate in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its
last full fiscal year, which amount is set forth in Section 8.03(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule; and provided further that, if the aggregate
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Acceptance Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount.

 

 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 8.03.

 

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 8.03 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under
Maryland Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

 

 

Section 8.04. Employee Matters.  (a) From the Acceptance Time until a
period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide to all
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Acceptance Time
who continue employment with the Company or any of its Affiliates after the
Acceptance Time or the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates after
the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") with (i) base salary or base
wages that are no less than the base salary or base wages provided to each
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Acceptance Time and (ii)
other compensation and benefits that are in the aggregate substantially
comparable to such other compensation and benefits provided by the Company
and its Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Acceptance Time
other than equity-based compensation. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything else contained herein to the contrary, following the Effective Time
the Continuing Employees shall be considered and be eligible for equity-based
compensation awards denominated in the equity of Parent on a basis that is no
less favorable than applies to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, as determined by Parent in its sole discretion.

 

 

(b) With respect to any compensation and/or benefit program, policy or
arrangement maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation, in which any Continuing Employee becomes a
participant, such Continuing Employee shall receive full credit (for purposes
of eligibility to participate, vesting, and benefit level and accrual, where
applicable under the compensation and/or benefit programs, policies or
arrangements of Parent or any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of its Subsidiaries), for service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides such past
service credit) to the same extent that such service was recognized as of the
Effective Time under a comparable plan of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
which the Continuing Employee participated (or if no comparable plan exists,
under the Company's 401(k) plan), except for benefit accrual under any final
average pay defined benefit pension plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no provision of this Section 8.04(b) shall be interpreted to preclude Parent
and/or its Subsidiaries from maintaining, establishing, or amending any
programs, policies or arrangements to provide a level of benefits or rate of
benefit accrual that differs from the Company's plans, as long as the
Continuing Employee's service credit is recognized for purposes of such
applicable provisions, to the extent relevant thereto.

 

 

(c) Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employees (and their eligible
dependents) are eligible to participate from and after the Acceptance Time,
except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have
been satisfied or waived under the comparable plan of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employee participated. If a Continuing
Employee commences participation in any health benefit plan of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries after the commencement of a calendar year, to the extent
commercially practicable, Parent shall cause such plan to recognize the
dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred
by such Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during such
calendar year for purposes of satisfying such calendar year's deductible and
co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such
Continuing Employee (and dependents) commences participation.

 

 

(d) From the Acceptance Time and for a period of one year following the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each
employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who suffers a termination of
employment under the circumstances described on Section 8.04(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule severance benefits in accordance with Section
8.04(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (taking into account such Company
Employee's service as required pursuant to Section 8.04(c) above).

 

 

(e) As of the Acceptance Time, Parent shall and shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to, and from and after the Effective Time shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, effectuate the agreements set
forth in Section 8.04(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) Nothing in this Section 8.04 shall (i) be treated as an amendment of,
or undertaking to amend any benefit plan, (ii) except as provided in
Section 8.04(d) above, prohibit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including
the Surviving Corporation, from amending or terminating any employee
benefit plan, (iii) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to continue the employment of any employees for
any period of time or (iv) confer any rights or benefits on any person
other than the parties to this Agreement.

Section 9.01. Reasonable Best Efforts. (a) Subject to the terms and

approving such transactions, consistent with this Agreement and/or to remove
any impediment to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to furnish all
information in connection with the approvals of or filings with any
Governmental Authority and shall promptly cooperate with and furnish
information in connection with any such requirements imposed upon Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to Section 9.02, Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain any consent, authorization, order or
approval of, or any exemption by, and to remove any impediment imposed by any
Governmental Authority to allow the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Parent and the Company shall each advise the other party
promptly of any material communication received by such party or any of its

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Affiliates from the Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice, any
state attorney general or any other Governmental Authority regarding any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and of any understandings, undertakings
or agreements (oral or written) such party proposes to make or enter into
with the Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice, any state attorney
general or any other Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and Company shall each consult with
the other in advance of any material meetings with the Federal Trade
Commission, Department of Justice, any state attorney general or any other
Governmental Authority.

 

 

Section 9.02. HSR Clearance. (a) In furtherance and not in limitation of

thereafter make any other required submissions with respect to the

appropriate actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
as soon as practicable.

 

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall promptly take, in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, all actions necessary to (i)
secure the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under
the HSR Act and (ii) resolve any objections asserted with respect to the

Law or the Federal Trade Commission Act, raised by any Governmental
Authority, and to prevent the entry of any court order and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including (A) executing settlements,
undertakings, consent decrees, stipulations or other agreements with any
Governmental Authority (or with any private party, but only in this latter
case, in order to vacate, lift, reverse, overturn, settle or otherwise
resolve any decree, judgment, injunction or other order that prevents,
prohibits, restricts or delays the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby that may be issued by any court or other Governmental
Authority in favor of that third party), (B) selling, divesting or otherwise

and its Subsidiaries contemporaneously with or subsequent to the Acceptance
Time and (D) permitting the Company to sell, divest or otherwise convey any

or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. All such efforts
shall be unconditional and shall not be qualified by best efforts and no
actions taken pursuant to this

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 9.02 shall be considered for purposes of determining whether a
Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred. Parent shall respond to and
seek to resolve as promptly as reasonably practicable any objections asserted
by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated
under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing or in
Section 9.01 or anything otherwise contained in this Agreement that may in
any such case be deemed to the contrary, the parties hereto understand and
agree that Parent shall not be required to take any action, agree to any
matter or accept any remedy of any type set forth in the foregoing provisions
of this Section 9.02 with respect to or involving any assets of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries that generated or represented
an amount equal to 30% or more of the Company's consolidated operating profit
for the twelve month period ending January 31, 2008.

 

 

Section 9.03. Cooperation. (a) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with
one another (i) in connection with the preparation of the Company Disclosure
Documents, the Offer Documents and the Notice of Merger, (ii) in determining
whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are
required to be obtained from parties to any material contracts, in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(iii) in taking such actions or making any such filings, furnishing

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain consents from the landlords under
those Leases of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would require the
landlord's consent in connection with the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement, including a merger or change of control of the tenant under any of
the Leases or that deem any such transaction to be an assignment of such
Lease requiring the landlord's consent (either, a "Deemed Assignment
Transaction"); provided that Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for
all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company to any landlord in
connection with obtaining such consents; provided further that any payment
made by the Company to any landlord shall be subject to the prior written
consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
The Company agrees, in connection with requests for consents to landlords for
Leases pursuant to the foregoing sentence, to make requests as soon as
practicable after the date hereof and to pursue such requests in a good faith
and diligent manner. The Company further agrees to provide Parent with
detailed progress reports on such requested consents on at least a weekly
basis. Parent agrees to cooperate with the Company's efforts and to use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain such consents by supplying any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercially reasonable information requested by the landlords who are
considering such requests. In addition, in connection with those Leases of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that merely require that the tenant
provide notices before or after a Deemed Assignment Transaction, the Company
agrees to send such notices to those landlords identified in writing by
Parent in the form prepared by Parent and within the timeframes identified by
Parent. Parent hereby indemnifies the Company and its Affiliates against and
agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all damage, loss, liability
and expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) actually
incurred or suffered by the Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of
the Company complying with its obligations set forth in the foregoing
sentence.

 

 

Section 9.04. Public Announcements. Parent and its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or making any other public
statement, or scheduling any press conference or conference call with
investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except as may be required by Applicable Law or any
listing agreement with or rule of any national securities exchange, shall not
issue any such press release or make any such other public statement or
schedule any such press conference or conference call before such
consultation.

 

 

Section 9.05. Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger
Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take
and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, any
other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise
in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to
be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger.

 

 

Section 9.06. Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders. If, at any time after
the Acceptance Time, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and any other Subsidiary of
Parent shall collectively own at least the Requisite Short-Form Merger
Shares, the parties shall take all necessary and appropriate action to cause
the Merger to be effected as soon as practicable without a meeting of
stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section 3-106 of
Maryland Law.

 

 

Section 9.07. Notices of Certain Events. Each of the Company and Parent
shall promptly notify the other of:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

 

(b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

Subsidiaries that relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement;

 

 

(d) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement at any time during the term hereof that would reasonably be
expected to cause any condition set forth in Article 10 not to be satisfied;
and

 

 

(e) any failure of that party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;

 

 

provided that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 9.07 shall
not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving that notice.

 

 

Section 9.08. Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute shall become
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Subsidiary and the respective members of their boards of
directors shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, use reasonable
best efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary
so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such Takeover Statute on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) by either the Company or Parent if:

 

 

(i) the Offer has not been consummated on or before August 12, 2009 (the

any provision of this Agreement results in the failure of the Offer to be
consummated on or before such time; or

 

 

(ii) there shall be any Applicable Law that (A) makes acceptance for payment
of, and payment for, the Shares pursuant to the Offer or consummation of the
Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or (B) enjoins Merger Subsidiary from
accepting for payment of, and paying for, the Shares pursuant to the Offer or
the Company or Parent from consummating the Merger and such injunction shall
have become final and nonappealable.

 

 

(c) by Parent if, prior to the Acceptance Time:

 

 

(i) an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred;

 

 

(ii) there shall have been an intentional and material breach of Section
7.04; or

 

 

(iii) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in clauses (iii) or (iv) of paragraph (b) of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Annex I and (B) is either incurable or, if curable, is not cured by the
Company by the earlier of (x) 30 days following receipt by the Company of
written notice of such breach or failure and (y) the End Date; provided that,
at the time of the delivery of such written notice, Parent shall not be in
material breach of its obligations under this Agreement.

(i) prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent or Merger Subsidiary shall have (A)
breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its covenants or
obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement or (B)
breached any of its representations or warranties (without regard to
materiality or Parent Material Adverse Effect qualifiers contained therein),
which breach or failure, in the case of clause (A) would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect and, in either clause (A) or (B) is either incurable or, if curable,
is not cured by Parent by the earlier of (x) 30 days following receipt by
Parent of written notice of such breach or failure and (y) the End Date;
provided, at the time of the delivery of such written notice, the Company
shall not be in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement; or

without liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer,
employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other
party hereto; provided that, if such termination shall result from the
intentional (a) failure of either party to fulfill a condition to the
performance of the obligations of the other party or (b) failure of either
party to perform a covenant hereof, such party shall be fully liable for any
and all liabilities and damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a
result of such failure. The provisions of Article 12 shall survive any
termination hereof pursuant to Section 11.01.

(ii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 11.01(b)(i), (B) prior to such termination, a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise been communicated to
the Board of Directors or the Company's stockholders and (C) within 12 months
following the date of such termination, the Company shall have entered into a
definitive agreement with respect to or recommended to its stockholders an
Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated
(provided that, in each case, for purposes of this clause (C), each reference
to "15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
a reference to "50%"), then the Company shall pay to Parent in
immediately available funds, concurrently with the occurrence of the
applicable event described in clause (C), the Termination Fee.

 

 

For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be required to pay
more than one Termination Fee.

 

 

(c) Reimbursement. If this Merger Agreement shall have been terminated
pursuant to Section 11.01(b)(i) due to a failure of the Minimum Condition to
be satisfied, the Company shall reimburse Parent and its Affiliates (by wire
transfer of immediately available funds), no later than two Business Days
after submission of reasonable documentation thereof, for 100% of their
reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and
expenses of their counsel) up to $10 million actually incurred by any of them
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including, for the sake of clarity, those incurred in connection with the
negotiation and consideration thereof and the due diligence investigation of
the Company and its Subsidiaries).

 

 

(d) Sole Remedy. The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 12.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary would not enter into this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary
acknowledges and agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that in the
event that the Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by the Company
pursuant to this Section 12.04, the right to receive the Termination Fee
shall constitute each of Parent's and Merger Subsidiary's and each of their
Affiliates and Representatives sole and exclusive remedy under this
Agreement.

 

 

Section 12.05. Disclosure Schedule References. The parties hereto agree that
any reference in a particular Section of either the Company Disclosure
Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed to be an
exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

63  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant
party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and
(b) any other representations and warranties of such party that is contained
in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an
exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and
warranties would be readily apparent to a reasonable person who has read that
reference and such representations and warranties, without any independent
knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so disclosed.
Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule to the Agreement (i) shall not
be considered an admission by the disclosing party that such item or fact (or
any non-disclosed item or information of comparable or greater significance)
represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such
item has had or is reasonably expected to result in, as applicable, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect, or that such
item or fact will in fact exceed any applicable threshold limitation set
forth in the Agreement and (ii) shall not be construed as an admission by the
disclosing party of any non-compliance with, or violation of, any third party
rights (including but not limited to any intellectual property rights) or any
law, regulation, order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority,
such disclosures having been made solely for the purposes of creating
exceptions to the representations made herein or of disclosing any
information required to be disclosed under the Agreement.

 

 

Section 12.06. Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment. (a) The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Except
as provided in Section 8.03 only, no provision of this Agreement is intended
to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities
hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.

 

 

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights
or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of each
other party hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or
assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time
to time in part, to one or more of its Affiliates or designees (which
Affiliates and/or designees may pay all or any portion of the consideration
payable by Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary pursuant to this Agreement) at any
time; provided that such transfer or assignment shall not (i) relieve Parent
or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations under this Agreement or prejudice the
rights of stockholders to receive payment for Shares validly tendered and
accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer or Shares converted into cash
pursuant to the Merger or (ii) be reasonably likely to delay consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

Section 12.07. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware, without regard
to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the conflicts of law rules of such state, except to the extent that Maryland
Law mandatorily applies to the matters arising under or in connection with
this Agreement.

 

 

Section 12.08. Jurisdiction.  (a) The parties hereto agree that any suit,
action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or the negotiation, interpretation, validity
or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer and the Merger) and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of
this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder whether
brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
successors or assigns or against any party or its Affiliates or any of their
respective successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively
in the Delaware Court of Chancery, or in the event (but only in the event)
that such court does not have jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, in
the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, or in the
event (but only in the event) that neither such court has jurisdiction over
such action or proceeding, the Delaware Superior Court, and each of
the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit,
action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the
venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any
such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 12.01
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties

66

terminated; or

 

 

(b) at any time on or after the date of the Agreement and prior to the

(i) there shall be instituted or pending any action or proceeding (or any

action or proceeding) by any Governmental Authority challenging or seeking to
make illegal, to delay materially or otherwise directly or indirectly to
restrain or prohibit the making of the Offer, the acceptance for payment of
or payment for some or all of the Shares by Parent or Merger Subsidiary or
the consummation of the Merger;

 

 

(ii) there shall have been any action taken, or any Applicable Law shall have
been proposed, enacted, enforced, promulgated, issued or deemed applicable to
the Offer or the Merger, by any Governmental Authority, other than the

the consummation of the Merger;

 

 

(iii) (A) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in any

address matters only as of another specified time, which shall be true and
correct in all material respects only as of such time) or (B) the other
representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Agreement
(disregarding all materiality and Company Material Adverse Effect
qualifications contained therein) shall not be true and correct at and as of
immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer as if made at and as of such
time (other than representations and warranties that by their terms address
