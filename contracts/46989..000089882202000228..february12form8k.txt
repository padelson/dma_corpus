forth in Article VI has been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions contemplated to be satisfied at, or only capable of being
satisfied at, the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those

Section 6.1.2) and the parties having complied with Section 5.5.1(a), if, at
the Closing, the Seller or the Purchasers shall not have obtained any
Transfer Approval (other than from third parties and other than a Transfer
Approval described in paragraph (b) of this Section 2.4.2) required to effect
the transfer of (i) any Transferred Subsidiary or any Transferred Asset, in
each case which would reasonably be expected to have a book value not

Business, or any Transferred Liability to the Purchaser (or its Designated
Affiliate) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) any property,
pursuant to Section 5.23    -24-    EXECUTION COPY 
--------------  or Section 5.27 (any transfer referred to in clause (i) or

Seller and the Purchasers shall continue to use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all Transfer Approvals (other than from third parties and
other than a Transfer Approval described in paragraph (b) of this Section
2.4.2) relating to such Transfer(s); provided, however, that this Section
2.4.2(a) shall be of no effect and shall not be implemented if (x) the
Transferred Subsidiaries and Transferred Assets which are not Transferred on
or prior to the Closing pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 2.4.2(a) are,
taken together, material to the Water Business or would reasonably be
expected to have an aggregate book value exceeding $40,000,000, or (y) doing
so would violate a Law the effect of which would be material to a material
portion of the Water Business. Except as provided in Section 5.5.1(b),
5.5.1(c), 5.5.1(d) and 5.5.1(e) with respect to Contracts, Retained Business
Contracts, Purchased Intellectual Property and Retained Business Intellectual
Property Rights, until such time (after the Closing) as all assets,
liabilities, rights, obligations and/or interests (including
equity interests) relating to such Transfer(s) (the "Deferred Business") have
been transferred, or otherwise disposed of, (i) by the Seller to the
Purchaser (or its Designated Affiliate), in the case of any Transferred
Subsidiary or any Transferred Asset or Transferred Liability, or (ii) by the
Purchaser (or its Designated Affiliate) to the Seller, in the case of any
asset, liability, right, obligation or interest (including equity interest)
relating to the Retained Business, the Excluded Assets or the Excluded
Liabilities, such Deferred Business shall be held, managed and operated by
the Seller (or its Affiliates) and by the Purchaser (or its Designated
Affiliate), respectively, in the manner provided in Exhibit VII.   (b)
Notwithstanding anything in Section 2.4.2(a) to the contrary, if, following
satisfaction, waiver or expiration of the condition set forth in Section
6.3.4, at the Closing, the Seller or the Purchasers shall not have obtained
any Transfer Approval (other than from third parties) with respect to any
step of the Reorganization (including approvals of Taxing
Authorities required to complete the steps described in Section 5.21A of the
Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule) required to effect the transfer of any
subsidiary, asset, liability, right, obligation or interest (including equity
interest) among the Seller\'s Affiliates in the manner set forth in Section
5.21A of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule or as otherwise permitted pursuant
to Section 5.21 of this Agreement (any such transfer, a "Reorganization
Transfer"); then, in each such case, from and after the Closing, the Seller
and the Purchasers shall continue to use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain all Transfer Approvals (other than from third parties) relating to
such Reorganization Transfer(s) and to complete the Reorganization in the
manner set forth in Section 5.21A of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule or as
otherwise permitted pursuant to Section 5.21 of this Agreement (it being
understood that in all cases, including following the Closing, the
determination of whether to use an alternative step contemplated by Section
5.21A or B of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule, or any other action
permitted under Section 5.21, shall be made by the Seller, in its sole
discretion); provided, however, that if a Reorganization Transfer is
not obtained by the one hundred eighty day anniversary of the date hereof,
any subsidiary, asset, liability, right, obligation or interest (including
equity interest) referred to above which cannot be transferred pursuant to a
step of the Reorganization by such time will be transferred at such time at
the Seller\'s cost in a manner other than as set forth in the Reorganization
(provided that the parties will act in good faith to minimize the costs of
such transfer). The parties also agree that until such anniversary the last
sentence of Section 2.4.2(a) and Exhibit VII (other than Exhibit VII(c))
shall apply to each Reorganization Transfer as if the Reorganization Transfer
were a    -25-   EXECUTION COPY  --------------   Transfer for
purposes of those provisions. For the avoidance of doubt, at the Closing, in
accordance with Section 2.1, the Seller shall (or shall cause one of its
Affiliates to) sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to the
Purchasers (1) the issued and outstanding capital stock of Betz, (2) the
Transferred Assets which are not involved in any step of the Reorganization,
except to the extent that Section 2.4.2(a) applies, (3) the Transferred
Assets which are involved in any step of the Reorganization and for which the
Transfer Approvals in respect of such step of the Reorganization have been
obtained, except to the extent that Section 2.4.2(a) applies, and (4) the
stock of each Water Subsidiary, if the Transfer Approvals in respect of any
step of the Reorganization as to such Water Subsidiary and all of the assets
and liabilities directly or indirectly held by such Water Subsidiary have
been obtained, except to the extent that Section 2.4.2(a) applies.   (c)
Prior to the Closing, in connection with the matters contemplated by the last
sentence of Section 2.4.2(a) and Exhibit VII (including in each case as
applicable to Section 2.4.2(b))(the "Deferral Provisions"), the Seller (or
its Affiliates) and the Purchaser (or its Designated Affiliate) shall prepare
and negotiate in good faith to enter into on or prior to the Closing such
supplemental agreements as are reasonably necessary, in the good
faith judgment of the Seller or the Purchaser, to give effect to the
Deferral Provisions in order, to the extent lawful and the greatest extent
practicable, to place the parties and their Affiliates in the same position
as would have obtained if the Transfer or Reorganization Transfer, as
applicable, had occurred at the Closing; provided that the execution and
delivery of such agreements shall not be a condition to the Closing.   
Section 2.5 Post-Closing Purchase Price Determination.   2.5.1 Definition.
The term "Final Purchase Price" means (a) the Preliminary Purchase Price
minus (b) the amount, if any, by which the Adjusted Base Net Assets exceeds
the Roll-Forward Closing Date Net Assets (as reflected in the Final Closing

Schedule).   2.5.2 Adjustments in the Purchase Price; Decreased
Consideration. If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Preliminary

the Roll-Forward Closing Date Net Assets pursuant to this Section 2.5 and

amount by which the Preliminary Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase
Price (such excess amount, the "Decreased Consideration"), the Seller shall

writing by the Purchaser, an amount in cash equal to the Decreased
Consideration plus interest on the Decreased Consideration from the Closing
Date to the date of such refund at an annual rate equal to the Borrowing

as at the close of business on the Accounting Closing Date (without giving
effect to the Closing and the     -26-   EXECUTION COPY 
--------------   Organizational Restructuring, but assuming completion of
the Reorganization) prepared in accordance with Section 2.5.3.5 (the "Closing
Date Statement of Net Assets") and (2) a calculation of the Roll-Forward
Closing Date Net Assets prepared in accordance with Section 2.7 of the
Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule. The Closing Date Statement of Net Assets shall
be accompanied by a certificate of the Seller stating the calculation of the
Closing Date Net Assets and the Roll-Forward Closing Date Net Assets (the

shall cause the Transferred Subsidiaries to, give the Seller and the
Seller\'s independent auditors sufficient access to the Water Business,
including its books, records and personnel to prepare and audit the Closing
Date Statement of Net Assets and the Seller\'s Certificate and calculate the
Roll-Forward Closing Date Net Assets. The Purchaser and the Purchaser\'s
accountants shall (subject to execution by the Purchasers and
the Purchasers\' accountants of such documents as reasonably requested by
such accountants) have the opportunity to consult with and to examine the
work papers, schedules and other documents prepared or reviewed by the
Seller\'s accountants in connection with the preparation of their report on
the Closing Date Statement of Net Assets and their calculation of Roll-
Forward Closing Date Net Assets.   2.5.3.2 Time for Objections. After the
Seller shall have furnished the Closing Date Statement of Net Assets and its
calculation of Roll-Forward Closing Date Net Assets to the Purchasers, the
Purchasers may object to (i) the Closing Date Statement of Net Assets but
only with respect to events occurring after the date hereof and prior to the
Accounting Closing Date and only on the ground that one or more of the line
items of such Closing Date Statement of Net Assets were not calculated in
accordance with this Agreement or (ii) the calculation of Roll-Forward
Closing Date Net Assets, but only on the grounds that it was not calculated
in accordance with procedures specified in Section 2.7 of the Seller\'s
Disclosure Schedule. If the Purchasers object to the calculation of any line
item of the Closing Date Statement of Net Assets or to the calculation of
Roll-Forward Closing Date Net Assets in accordance with procedures specified
in Section 2.7 of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule, the Purchasers may give
a reasonably detailed written notice of their objection to the Seller within
30 days after their receipt of the Closing Date Statement of Net Assets,
which notice shall state specifically (i) the disputed line item(s) or
calculation, (ii) the basis for the dispute(s) with respect to each line
item or such calculation, and (iii) the adjustments sought with respect to
each such line item or calculation and each such dispute. If no such notice
is delivered within such 30-day period, or if the Purchasers and the Seller
agree upon all matters in dispute within the 45-day period specified in
Section 2.5.3.3, then the Closing Date Statement of Net Assets and their
calculation of Roll-Forward Closing Date Net Assets, as adjusted to reflect
any such agreements, shall be final and binding upon all parties hereto for
the purpose of determining the Closing Date Net Assets and the Roll-Forward
Closing Date Net Assets, and the Closing Date Statement of Net Assets shall
be referred to herein as the "Final Closing Date Statement of Net
Assets."   2.5.3.3 Dispute Resolution. The Purchasers and the Seller
will use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any matters in dispute,
with respect to the calculation of the Closing Date Net Assets or to the
calculation of Roll-Forward Closing Date Net Assets in accordance with
procedures specified in Section 2.7 of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule, as
rapidly as practicable. If the Purchasers and the Seller are unable to
resolve all items in dispute, with respect to the calculation of the Closing
Date Net Assets or to the calculation of Roll-    -27-   EXECUTION
COPY  --------------  Forward Closing Date Net Assets in accordance with
procedures specified in Section 2.7 of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule,
within 45 days after the Seller\'s receipt of the Purchasers\' written
objection to the Closing Date Statement of Net Assets or to the calculation
of Roll-Forward Closing Date Net Assets in accordance with procedures
specified in Section 2.7 of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule pursuant to
Section 2.5.3.2, then those items or calculations in dispute shall be
submitted for resolution to the Independent Accountant. The parties
acknowledge that in submitting disputed items to the Independent Accountant,
the Seller shall be entitled to present items not disputed in the
Purchasers\' notice to the Seller under Section 2.5.3.2 and to present
adjustments to the Independent Accountant in the Seller\'s favor even
if inconsistent with the Closing Date Statement of Net Assets, to the extent
such items are based upon facts, circumstances or positions raised in the
Purchasers\' notice delivered pursuant to Section 2.5.3.2 or that the Seller
becomes aware of after delivery of the Closing Date Statement of Net Assets
to the Purchasers. The Independent Accountant shall act as an expert to
determine, based solely on the presentations by the Seller and the
Purchasers, and not by independent review, only those items or calculations
still in dispute (or brought into dispute pursuant to the preceding
sentence), and shall resolve such disputes in accordance with the preceding
sentence and Section 2.5.3.5 and Section 2.7 of the Seller\'s Disclosure
Schedule; provided, however, that in no event shall the Independent
Accountant consider any adjustment of any line item of the Closing Date
Statement of Net Assets or the Closing Date Net Assets, unless the Purchaser
demonstrates that the dispute with respect to such line item
relates specifically to a change occurring after date hereof and prior to the
Accounting Closing Date and then such adjustment shall only be permitted to
the extent of the adjustment caused by such change that has not already been
reflected in the line item of the Closing Date Statement of Net Assets;
provided, further, that in no event shall the Independent Accountant consider
any adjustment of the Roll-Forward Closing Date Net Assets, unless the
dispute is with the calculation of the Roll-Forward Closing Date Net Assets
in accordance with procedures specified in Section 2.7 of the Seller\'s
Disclosure Schedule and then such adjustment shall only be permitted to the
extent necessary to reflect the correct calculation of the Roll-Forward
Closing Date Net Assets in accordance with procedures specified in Section
2.7 of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule. The determination of the
Independent Accountant with respect to those items in dispute, which shall be
made within 30 days of their selection and shall be set forth in a written
statement delivered to the Seller and the Purchasers, together with the
determinations of the Purchasers and the Seller with respect to those items
accepted by the Purchasers (not otherwise affected by this Section 2.5.3.3)
or otherwise resolved between the Purchasers and the Seller, shall become the
Final Closing Date Statement of Net Assets and shall be final and binding
upon all parties hereto. The determination of the Independent Accountant with
respect to those calculations in dispute shall also be made within 30 days of
their selection and shall be set forth in the written statement delivered to
the Seller and the Purchasers.   2.5.3.4 Payment of Fees. The Seller shall
pay the fees of its accountants, and the Purchasers shall pay the fees of
their accountants, in connection with the preparation and review of the
Closing Date Statement of Net Assets and the Final Closing Date Statement of
Net Assets. The fees and disbursements of or related to the Independent
Accountant shall be borne one-half by the Purchasers and one-half by the
Seller.   2.5.3.5 Procedures for Preparing Statement; Inventory.
For purposes of this Section 2.5, the Closing Date Statement of Net Assets
shall be prepared (i) in accordance    -28-   EXECUTION COPY 
--------------   with GAAP, except as expressly identified in (and in
accordance with the procedures, assumptions, conventions and adjustments set
forth in) Section 2.5.3.5 of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule, applied on a
basis consistent with the preparation of the Combined Statement of Net Assets
(other than with respect to Taxes) and the Base Net Assets Statement (except
as set forth in Section 2.5.5), (ii) in accordance with Section 2.5 of the
Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule (with respect to foreign currency exchange

(B) the Transferred Assets, (w) the Water Business has no Liabilities other
than (A) those of the Transferred Subsidiaries (other than any Liabilities of
the Transferred Subsidiaries that are Excluded Liabilities) and (B) the
Transferred Liabilities, (x) the occurrence of the Closing will not, in and
of itself, have any effect on the preparation, (y) the Reorganization has
been completed, and (z) the Organizational Restructuring has not occurred.
For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that the
Closing Date Statement of Net Assets shall be prepared using principles under
GAAP appropriate for the Water Business (except as expressly identified in,
and in accordance with the procedures, assumptions, conventions and
adjustments set forth in, Section 2.5.3.5 of the Seller\'s Disclosure
Schedule and Section 2.5.5) which may not be the same as those used to
prepare the financial statements of the Seller and its consolidated
Subsidiaries. For the purposes of preparing the Closing Date Statement of Net
Assets, a physical inventory shall be taken as of the close of business on
the Accounting Closing Date in accordance with Section 5.15; provided,
however, that any disputes over the physical inventory, settled in the manner
described in this Section 2.5 shall be limited to inventory which is created
or obtained between the date hereof and the Accounting Closing Date.   2.5.4
The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that no objection to or dispute of
(1) the Combined Statement of Net Assets, the Base Net Assets, the Base Net
Assets Statement, or the items reflected thereon may be made pursuant to this
Agreement, or (2) the Adjusted Base Net Assets, the Adjusted Base Net Assets
Statement, and the Roll-Forward Closing Date Net Assets or the
items reflected thereon may be made pursuant to this Agreement, except in the
case of clause (2) on the grounds that the calculation of (a) the Adjusted
Base Net Assets, (b) the Adjusted Base Net Assets Statement, or (c) the Roll-
Forward Closing Date Net Assets, respectively, was not made in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Section 2.5 of the Seller\'s Disclosure
Schedule in the case of (a) or (b) and the procedures set forth in Section
2.7 of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule in the case of (c).   2.5.5
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
hereto agree and acknowledge that the Base Net Assets Statement and the
Closing Date Statement of Net Assets shall not reflect any Tax assets or
Tax liabilities, in each case, whether current, deferred or otherwise.  
Section 2.6 Allocation of Final Purchase Price. The Seller, the Purchasers,
the Transferred Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates shall
report for all Tax purposes consistent with Section 2.6 of the
Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule, and shall take no Tax position inconsistent
with Section 2.6 of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule, except (i) as
otherwise required by a "determination" with respect to such Person within
the meaning of Code Section 1313(a), or similar provision of state, local or
foreign Law, (ii) to the extent there is no reasonable basis for reporting
for Tax purposes consistent with the values set forth on Section 2.6 of the
Seller\'s     -29-   EXECUTION COPY  --------------    Disclosure
Schedule or (iii) to the extent that reporting consistent with such values
would reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of penalties by a
Taxing Authority. The Seller and the Purchasers shall, no later than 120
days after the determination of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to Section
2.5, attempt in good faith to enter into a Final Purchase Price allocation
agreement (consistent with Section 2.6 of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule
(except to the extent there is no reasonable basis for reporting for Tax
purposes consistent with the values set forth on Section 2.6 of the Seller\'s
Disclosure Schedule or reporting consistent with such values would reasonably

the Purchasers shall report for all Tax purposes consistent with, and shall
take no Tax position inconsistent with, such Final Purchase Price allocation,

Section 2.7 Accounting Close. For purposes of this Agreement, the Seller and

Reorganization Tax Prepayment Amount. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, following receipt of the
Preliminary Purchase Price, the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser (or to such
Affiliate of the Purchaser as the Purchaser designates) an amount in cash
equal to $8,762,000 (the "Reorganization Tax Prepayment Amount") by
wire transfer of such amount to accounts designated in writing by the
Purchaser (provided that in lieu of making any portion of such payment, the
Seller may instead procure that, at Closing, such portion is held in the form
of cash by a Transferred Subsidiary in an amount that does not exceed the
amount set forth on Section 2.8 of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule in
respect of such Transferred Subsidiary); provided, that nothing herein will
prevent the Transferred Subsidiaries from holding cash in excess of such
amounts as of and after the Closing as otherwise permitted by this Agreement.
The Purchasers and the Seller acknowledge and agree that such Reorganization
Tax Prepayment Amount was determined by discounting at a rate of 12% per
annum $9,629,000 (the "Estimated Reorganization Tax Amount") (which is 110%
of the agreed upon estimated liabilities for which the Seller is responsible
pursuant to Section 5.9.1(b) in respect of amounts to be owed by the
Transferred Subsidiaries to a Taxing Authority) from the estimated Closing
Date until the nine month anniversary of the estimated Closing Date and that
the amounts set forth on Section 2.8 of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule
were determined by discounting at the same rate and over the same period 110%
of such estimated liabilities in respect of each Transferred Subsidiary set
forth on such schedule.     -30-   EXECUTION COPY  --------------

indirectly by a Purchased Subsidiary, free and clear of any Encumbrances.

the foregoing, in the event that a consent, waiver or approval of a third
party is required to effect any step of the Reorganization (other than a
consent, waiver or approval of a third party described in the exception in
the proviso of the preceding sentence), the Seller shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain such consent, waiver or approval.   (b) If any
Transfer Approval necessary for the assignment or transfer to, or assumption
by, the Purchaser or a Transferred Subsidiary of any Contract or Purchased
Intellectual Property or any claim, right or benefit or any liability or
obligation arising thereunder or resulting therefrom shall not have been
obtained prior to the Closing Date, then as of the Closing, this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, to the extent permitted by Law, shall

commercially reasonable steps and actions to provide the Purchaser with the
benefits of such Contracts and Purchased Intellectual Property, and, in the
case of Contracts, to relieve the Seller of the performance and other
obligations thereunder, including entry into subcontracts or guarantees for
the performance thereof.   (c) If any Transfer Approval necessary for the
assignment or transfer to, or assumption by, the Seller or any of its

included in the Excluded Assets and obtained directly or indirectly at the
Closing by the Purchaser (or its Designated Affiliate) or any claim, right or
benefit or any liability or obligation arising thereunder or resulting
therefrom shall not have been obtained immediately after the Closing Date,
then as of the Closing, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, to the
extent permitted by Law, shall constitute an equitable assignment by the

thereunder, including entry into subcontracts or guarantees for
the performance thereof.   (d) If the parties hereto shall be unable to
make the equitable assignment and assumption described in Section 5.5.1(b),
or if such attempted assignment and assumption would give rise to any right
of termination, or would otherwise adversely affect the rights or liabilities
or obligations of the Seller or the Purchaser under such Contract or
Purchased Intellectual Property, or would not assign or result in the
assumption of all of the Seller\'s rights or liabilities or obligations
thereunder at the Closing, the Seller and the Purchaser shall continue to
cooperate with each other and, subject to Section 5.5.1(a), use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the Purchaser with all such rights, subject to

rise to any right of termination, or would otherwise adversely affect the
rights or liabilities or obligations of the Seller or the Purchaser or its
Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) under such Retained
Business Contract or Retained Business Intellectual Property Rights, or would
not assign or result in the assumption of all of the rights or liabilities or
obligations thereunder of the Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Subsidiaries) that would exist immediately after the Closing, the
Seller and the Purchasers shall continue to cooperate with each other and,
subject to Section 5.5.1(a), use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
the Seller with all such rights, subject to the Seller bearing all of such
liabilities and obligations. To the extent that any such consents and waivers
are not obtained, or until the impediments to such assignment or assumption
are resolved, the Seller and the Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Subsidiaries) shall, subject to Section 5.5.1(a), use

later date as provided for in this Section 5.5.1.   5.5.2 Subject to the
terms and conditions hereof (including, to the extent applicable, Sections
2.4.2 and 5.6), from time to time, whether before, at or following the
Closing, each of the Purchasers and the Seller shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, make commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable, including as required
by applicable Laws, to assure fully to the Purchasers and their successors
or permitted assigns, all of Transferred Assets and Transferred

or liability contemplated by this Agreement to be a Transferred Asset (or an
asset of a Transferred Subsidiary) or a Transferred Liability (or a Liability
of a Transferred Subsidiary), respectively, which asset or liability was

the Reorganization) with respect to payments to Governmental Authorities
which shall be made and payments to third parties (or reimbursements of third
parties\' expenses) which are required to be made and which shall be made
pursuant to the terms of the Seller\'s Contracts with such third parties for,

of the Reorganization, in no event shall the Seller or the Purchasers or
their respective Affiliates be required to make payments to third parties in
order to obtain their consent, waiver or approval, other than as may be
required to implement any step of the Reorganization. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a consent, waiver or approval of a third party
is required to effect any step of the Reorganization (other than a consent,
waiver or approval of a third party described in the exception in the proviso
of the preceding sentence), the Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain such consent, waiver or approval. Any existing cash, indebtedness
and intercompany balances after the Closing Date shall be settled in

of the Purchasers and the Seller shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, make commercially reasonable efforts to make or cause to be
made all filings and applications required of each of them or such Affiliates

practicable, and in any event, within 20 Business Days after the date of this
Agreement.   Section 5.6 Certain Covenants.   5.6.1 Each of the Purchasers
and the Seller shall (a) make or cause to be made all filings required of
each of them or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates under the
HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby as promptly as practicable and, in any event, within 10 Business Days

Antitrust Laws for additional information, documents, or other materials
received by each of them or any of their respective Subsidiaries from the
FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental    -62-   EXECUTION
COPY  --------------  Authority in respect of such filings or such
transactions, and (c) cooperate with each other in connection with any such
filing (including, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, providing
copies of all such documents to the non-filing parties prior to filing and
considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in
connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any investigation or
other inquiry of any of the FTC, the Antitrust Division or other Governmental
Authorities under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing or any
such transaction. Each such party shall use reasonable best efforts to
furnish to each other all information required for any application or other
filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each such party shall promptly
inform the other parties hereto of any oral communication with, and provide
copies of written communications with, any Governmental Authority regarding
any such filings or any such transaction. No party hereto shall independently
participate in any formal meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect
of any such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other
parties hereto prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and/or participate.
Subject to applicable Law, the parties hereto will consult and cooperate with
one another in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any party hereto relating to proceedings under the HSR Act or
other Antitrust Laws. The Seller and the Purchasers may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 5.6 as "outside
counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the
recipient, unless express written permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials (the Seller or the Purchasers, as the case may
be).   5.6.2 Each of the Purchasers and the Seller shall use reasonable
best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by
any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton
Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other
United States federal or state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations,
orders, decrees, administrative or judicial doctrines or other Laws that are
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, the "Antitrust
Laws"). In connection therewith, if any Action is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement
as a violation of any Antitrust Law, each of the Purchasers and the Seller
shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any
such Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by
pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal unless,
by mutual agreement, the Purchasers and the Seller decide that litigation is
not in their respective best interests. Each of the Purchasers and the Seller
shall use reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to
cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly as possible
after the execution of this Agreement.    -63-   EXECUTION COPY 
--------------    5.6.3 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (a) neither the Purchasers nor the Seller in using their
reasonable best efforts as specified in Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 shall be
required in connection with the execution and performance of this Agreement
to hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or divest any of their
respective businesses or assets owned by either the Purchasers or the Seller
(or their respective Affiliates) as of the date of this Agreement or agree to
any condition, restraint, or limitation relating to their ability to freely
own or operate all or a portion of the respective businesses or assets owned
by either the Purchasers or the Seller as of the date of this Agreement, and
(b) in connection with seeking clearance or approval from any Governmental
Authority, neither the Seller Entities (with respect to any portion of the
Water Business), nor the Transferred Subsidiaries shall, without the Parent
Purchaser\'s prior written consent, commit to any divestiture transaction, or
commit to alter their businesses or commercial practices in any way, or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits the Purchaser\'s
freedom of action with respect to, or the Purchaser\'s ability to retain any
of the businesses, product lines or assets of, the Water Business.   Section
5.7 Notification by the Parties. Each party hereto shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly inform the other parties hereto in writing if,
prior to the consummation of the Closing, it obtains knowledge that any of
the representations and warranties made by such party in this Agreement
ceases to be accurate and complete in any material respect (except for any
representation and warranty that is qualified hereunder as to materiality
or Material Adverse Effect, as to which such notification shall be given if
the notifying party obtains knowledge that such representation and warranty
ceases to be accurate and complete in any respect). Any such notification
shall not be deemed to have cured any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made in this Agreement for any purposes of this
Agreement.   Section 5.8 Employees and Employee Benefits.   5.8.1 Employee
Lists; Works Councils; Employment of Business Employees. In addition to the
lists described below and in Section 3.15.1, the Seller shall provide the
Purchasers, within 10 business days of the date hereof, with revised
versions, accurate as of the date hereof or such later date as may be
indicated thereon, of the Divisional Employee List, the Allocated
Employee List, the Water Subsidiary Employee List and the Water Asset
Employee List. Such updated lists shall indicate (a) for listed individual
who is on approved leave of absence as of the date indicated on such list,
the reason for or nature of such individual\'s absence and his or her
anticipated date of return to active employment, if any, and (b) the
employing entity for each Divisional Employee and each Water Asset Employee.
The Seller shall promptly notify the Parent Purchaser of the occurrence of
any event after the date hereof and before the Closing, which under any
applicable Laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United States of America,
requires notification and/or consultation with employee representatives,
affected parties or government agencies, a "social plan," or similar employer
action as a result of, or in connection with, employee terminations or
business restructurings affecting Business Employees. In addition, from the
date hereof through the Closing, the Seller shall provide the Purchasers with
such information and documentation as they may reasonably request relating to
any agreements with or obligations to any works councils with respect to
Business Employees or any employee termination agreement with respect to
employees listed on Schedule 3.17.4.   -64-   EXECUTION COPY

Date, the Seller shall, or shall cause one or more of its Affiliates

who are Water Subsidiaries Employees employed in the United States and (y)
retain in their employment Absent Employees who are Divisional Employees,
Water Asset Employees and Allocated Employees employed in the United States
(the "Excluded Employees"). The Purchasers or one of their Affiliates shall
offer employment to any Excluded Employee on the terms and conditions
required by this Agreement as if he or she were not an Absent Employee,
subject to the following conditions: (i) if such Excluded Employee is on
medical or disability leave, the Excluded Employee is released by his or her
physician to return to active employment and (ii) such Excluded Employee
actually reports for active employment with any of the Purchasers and their
Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) immediately upon such
medical release or expiration of the applicable approved leave; provided,
however, that the Purchasers shall not be required to offer employment under
this provision after the reemployment period provided in the applicable
policies of the Seller or after the expiration of any applicable domestic or
foreign federal or state law period, if later. The date on which an Excluded
Employee is required to become an employee of the Purchasers or one of their
Affiliates is hereinafter referred to as his or her "Hire Date." The Closing
Date shall be the "Hire Date" for all other Transferred Employees.   5.8.1.2
Water Subsidiary Employees. The Seller shall provide the Purchasers with the
Water Subsidiary Employee List on Section 3.15.1 of the Seller\'s Disclosure
Schedule as of the date hereof, and the Purchasers shall have fifteen days
thereafter to examine and review such list and to consult with the Seller and
the Transferred Subsidiaries, which shall make themselves available for such
consultation, to confirm the accuracy and completeness of such list. The
Seller shall have an ongoing duty under this Agreement to maintain the
accuracy of such list through the Closing Date, and shall, as soon as
practicable, inform the Purchasers of any corrective changes needed
thereto. Water Subsidiary Employees who are not Excluded Employees shall
initially continue to be employed by the Transferred Subsidiaries immediately
after the Closing Date and the terms of their employment shall thereafter be
governed by the policies of the Purchasers and their Affiliates (including
the Transferred Subsidiaries), the terms of their Employment Agreements, if
any, and applicable Law. Nothing in this Section 5.8.1.2 shall be construed
to guarantee any continuing right of employment to any such Water Subsidiary
Employee.   5.8.1.3 Water Asset Employees. The Seller shall provide
the Purchasers with the Water Asset Employee List as of the date hereof, and
the Purchasers shall have fifteen days thereafter to examine and review such
list and to consult with the Seller and the Transferred Subsidiaries, which
shall make themselves available for such consultation, to confirm the
accuracy and completeness of such list. The Seller shall have an ongoing duty
under this Agreement to maintain the accuracy of such list through the
Closing Date, and shall, as soon as practicable, inform the Purchasers of any
corrective changes needed thereto. The Purchasers shall make, or shall cause
one of their Affiliates to make, offers of employment, effective as of the
Closing Date, to all Water Asset Employees who are not Excluded Employees.
Nothing in this Section 5.8.1.3 shall be construed to guarantee any
continuing right of employment to any such Water Asset Employee.   
-65-   EXECUTION COPY  --------------   5.8.1.4 Divisional Employees. The
Seller shall provide the Purchasers with the Divisional Employee List on
Section 3.15.1 of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule as of the date hereof,
and the Purchasers shall have fifteen days after the date hereof to consult
with the Seller and the Transferred Subsidiaries, which shall make themselves
available for such consultation, regarding the Divisional Employee List, to
confirm the accuracy and completeness of such list. The Purchasers shall
make, or shall cause one of their Affiliates to make, offers of employment,
effective as of the Closing Date, to all Divisional Employees who are not
Excluded Employees, other than the Specified Divisional Employees (as defined
in the next sentence), if any. The "Specified Divisional Employees" shall
mean those Divisional Employees agreed to by the Purchasers and the Seller,
not in excess of 50 such Divisional Employees, determined as follows:   (a)
Not later than five days after the end of the consultation period
contemplated above, and in no event less than fifteen days before the Closing
Date, the Purchasers shall provide a written notice to the Seller setting
forth the names of not more than 75 proposed Specified Divisional Employees
(the "Proposed List"). If the Purchasers do not deliver the Proposed List
within such time period, there shall be no Specified Divisional Employees.  
(b) The Seller may provide the Purchasers, within ten days after receiving
the Proposed List, with a notice setting forth the names of any Divisional
Employees named on the Proposed List whose severance from employment is
reasonably likely to result in a material Liability or an additional
notification period or obligation to negotiate a social plan, in each case on
the part of the Seller or any of its Affiliates (excluding the Transferred
Subsidiaries) relating to the WARN Act, a social plan related to
a restructuring, a collective dismissal, or similar issues under applicable
Law, in each case, in connection with reorganizations or restructurings
currently in effect or planned as of the date of such determination. If the
Seller provides such a notice within such time period, the Seller and the
Purchasers shall consult and cooperate with one another for the following
three days, or such shorter period as they may agree, seeking to revise the
Proposed List so as to reduce the number of Divisional Employees to not more
than 50. If, at the conclusion of such period of consultation, the Seller
reasonably believes that the severance from employment of any Divisional
Employee(s) whom the Purchasers have not agreed to remove from the Proposed
List would result in such a material Liability or such an additional
notification period or obligation to negotiate a social plan, the Seller
shall thereupon notify the Purchasers of such fact and of the name(s) of such
Divisional Employee(s), and such Divisional Employee(s) shall be removed from
the Proposed List and shall not be considered Specified Divisional
Employees.   (c) If, at the conclusion of any period of
consultation required by Section 5.8.1.4(b) above and the removal of any
Divisional Employees as required by the last sentence thereof, the Proposed
List still lists more than 50 Divisional Employees, or if no such period of
consultation is required because the Seller does not deliver the notice
provided for therein, the Purchasers shall select and remove from the
Proposed List such number of Divisional Employees as may be necessary to
reduce the number thereof to not more than 50.  After completion of all of
the foregoing steps, the Proposed List shall be considered final and the
Divisional Employees who remain on the final list shall be the Specified
Divisional Employees.     -66-   EXECUTION COPY  --------------  
5.8.1.5 Allocated Employees. The Seller shall provide the Purchasers with the
Allocated Employee List on Section 3.15.1 of the Seller\'s Disclosure
Schedule as of the date hereof, and the Purchasers shall have fifteen days
thereafter to consult with the Seller and the Transferred Subsidiaries, which
shall make themselves available for such consultation, to confirm
the accuracy and completeness of such list. After the expiration of such
fifteen-day period, the Purchasers shall determine to which Allocated
Employees they shall extend employment offers and shall provide such list to
the Seller in writing. Subject to approval of the Seller, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, the Purchasers or their Affiliates shall thereafter
make offers of employment, effective as of the Closing Date, to such selected
Allocated Employees. As soon as practicable after receiving such list, the
Seller shall inform the Purchasers in writing of the employing entity for
each Allocated Employee to whom such offers are made. Except as specifically
provided elsewhere in this Section 5.8, the Seller and its Affiliates
(excluding the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall retain all Liabilities with
respect to Allocated Employees who reject employment offers made to them by
the Purchasers or their Affiliates and with respect to those Allocated
Employees to whom no employment offer is made by the Purchasers or their
Affiliates pursuant to this Section 5.8.1.5.   5.8.1.6 Severance and Similar
Liabilities. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of this
Section 5.8, the Purchasers shall use all reasonable efforts and the Seller
shall consult and cooperate with the Purchasers, so that the terms and
conditions of all offers of employment made by the Purchasers and its
Affiliates to Water Asset Employees, Divisional Employees and Allocated
Employees pursuant to this Section 5.8.1, and the terms and conditions of the
continued employment of the Water Subsidiary Employees after their respective
Hire Dates, shall satisfy all requirements of applicable Law and shall be
sufficient to prevent (to the extent possible under applicable Law) giving
rise to a right, on the part of any Business Employee, to receive
any Severance Benefits or enhanced Severance Benefits arising out of or as
a consequence of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby ("Transactional Severance Benefits"). The Purchasers shall be solely
responsible for: (a) any Liabilities relating to Transactional Severance
Benefits to which any Business Employee (including a Divisional Employee or
Water Asset Employee who is considered a Former Business Employee) becomes
entitled as a result of a failure by the Purchasers to comply with their
obligations under this Section 5.8 or a failure of such terms and conditions
to prevent the right to Transactional Severance Benefits from arising; and
(b) any Liabilities relating to any Specified Divisional Employee arising as
a result of the Purchasers\' not making an offer of employment to such
Specified Divisional Employee, including, Liabilities relating to Severance
Benefits and other Liabilities arising under applicable Law as a result of
the selection by the Purchasers of the Specified Divisional Employees. The
Seller and its Affiliates (excluding the Transferred Subsidiaries) and the
Purchaser and their Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall
each be responsible for one-half of all Liabilities relating to any other
Severance Benefits, if any, to which any Transferred Employee who accepts an
offer of employment from the Purchasers or its Affiliates or who is an
employee of a Transferred Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing
becomes entitled to receive under applicable Law as a result of
transactions contemplated hereby. The Seller and its Affiliates (excluding
the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall be solely responsible for any and all
Liabilities relating to Severance Benefits to which any Divisional Employee
or Water Asset Employee employed in the United States becomes entitled due to
the failure to accept an offer of employment by the Purchasers, (a) in the
case of an "exempt"    -67-   EXECUTION COPY 
--------------   employee under the FLSA, regardless of the location of
such employment, and (b) in the case of a "non-exempt" employee under the
FLSA, at the same location of employment, in either case notwithstanding the
Purchasers\' compliance with this Section 5.8. Except as specified in Section
5.8.12, the Seller and its Affiliates (excluding the Transferred
Subsidiaries) shall be solely responsible for any and all Liabilities
relating to Severance Benefits to which any Business Employee becomes
entitled solely as a result of actions by the Seller or its Affiliates taken
before the applicable Hire Date. The Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts, but shall not be required, to retain the Specified Divisional
Employees in its employ or that of its Affiliates (excluding the Transferred
Subsidiaries).   5.8.1.7 Deferred Foreign Employee Transfers.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.8.1, in the event
that as a result of applicable Law or otherwise, the Seller and the
Purchasers mutually determine that it is necessary or desirable to defer for
a period after the Closing Date (the "Deferral Period") the transfer to the
employ of the Purchasers and their Affiliates of any individuals or group of
individuals employed outside of the United States of America who would
otherwise become Transferred Employees as of the Closing Date (the "Deferred
Transfer Employees"), the Seller and the Purchasers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to deal with such matters, including, entering into a
mutually agreeable transition services agreement or employee leasing
arrangement, so as to provide for the continued employment of the Deferred
Transfer Employees by the Seller and its Affiliates until such transfer can
be completed, during which period the Deferred Transfer Employees shall be
made available to the Purchasers for work in the Water Business and
the Purchasers shall fully reimburse the Seller and its Affiliates for
all compensation, benefit costs and expenses, and be solely responsible for,
all Liabilities, to or relating the Deferred Transfer Employees or arising
out of the employment and/or services of the Deferred Transfer Employees from
and after the Closing, to the same extent as if the Deferred Transfer
Employees\' employment had transferred to the Purchasers and their Affiliates
as of the Closing Date. No Deferral Period hereunder shall exceed six months
following the Closing Date. During any Deferral Period, the Seller shall
obtain the written consent of the Purchasers to any change in the
compensation package offered to any such Deferred Transfer Employees.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if it is not commercially feasible for the
Seller and its Affiliates to continue the employment of any Deferred Transfer
Employees during a Deferral Period, the parties shall make mutually
satisfactorily alternative arrangements.   5.8.2 Compensation and Benefits
After the Closing. Subject to the approval of the GE Pension Board, which
approval the Purchasers shall use their best efforts to obtain with full
endorsement: (a) the Purchasers shall, or shall cause one of their respective
Affiliates to, initially provide to Transferred Employees, a total
compensation package of salary, wages and benefits (on an aggregate basis)
that is comparable, in the aggregate, to the compensation package that they
had immediately prior to the applicable Hire Date, and which includes the
Purchasers\' "Tier 1" benefits package as of the applicable Hire Date, and
(b) until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Purchasers and their
Affiliates shall, with respect to such compensation package in the aggregate,
treat such employees generally in the same manner as other similarly situated
employees of the Purchasers and their Affiliates. Nothing in this Section
5.8.2 shall be construed to require the Purchasers to provide any particular
benefit or combination of benefits and compensation to any Transferred
Employee on an ongoing basis.    -68-   EXECUTION COPY 
--------------    5.8.3 Liabilities under U.S. Benefit Plans and Employment
Agreements. The Seller and the Purchasers shall take all steps necessary or
appropriate so that, effective not later than immediately following the
Closing, and except as specifically provided elsewhere in this Section 5.8:
(a) each of the Seller Benefit Plans that is a U.S. Benefit Plan and the Betz
Laboratories Inc. Pension Benefit Restoration Plan (collectively, the
"Retained U.S. Plans") is sponsored solely by the Seller and/or any of its
Affiliates (excluding the Transferred Subsidiaries), and the Purchasers and
their respective Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall
have no further obligations or Liabilities thereunder; (b) none of the
Transferred Subsidiaries is a fiduciary with respect to any Retained U.S.
Plan; (c) all assets set aside to fund any of the Retained U.S. Plans
(including insurance policies and grantor trusts) are retained by the Seller
and/or its Affiliates (excluding the Transferred Subsidiaries); (d)
each Assumed Water Business Benefit Plan that is a U.S. Benefit Plan is
sponsored solely by one or more of the Purchasers and/or any of their
respective Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries), and the
Seller and its Affiliates (excluding the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall have
no further obligations or Liabilities thereunder; and (e) all obligations of
the Seller and its Affiliates with respect to benefits of Transferred
Employees and Former Business Employees reflected in their account balances
as of the applicable Hire Date (for Transferred Employees) or as of the
Closing Date (for Former Business Employees) under the Hercules Deferred
Compensation Plan have been assumed by one or more of the Purchasers and/or
any of their respective Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries)
and the Seller and its Affiliates (excluding the Transferred Subsidiaries)
have no further obligation or Liability with respect thereto. To the extent
that the consent of any Transferred Employee or of any other third party to
any of the foregoing is required, the Seller and the Purchasers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent.   5.8.4 U.S. Service
Recognition. Under the employee benefit plans of the Purchasers and their
respective Affiliates providing benefits primarily to persons employed in the
United States of America in which any Transferred Employees participate after
the Closing (the "New Plans"), each Transferred Employee shall be credited
with his or her years of service with the Seller and its Affiliates and any
predecessor employers before his or her Hire Date, to the same extent as such
Transferred Employee was entitled, before such Hire Date, to credit for such
service under any similar Seller Benefit Plans for all purposes except
pension benefit accruals, and except to the extent such credit would result
in a duplication of benefits for such credited period of service.
In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (a)
each Transferred Employee employed in the United States of America shall
be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and
all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage
under a comparable Benefit Plan in which such individual previously
participated (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"); and (b) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any such Transferred Employee, the Purchasers shall cause
(i) all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
of such New Plan to be waived for such individual and his or her covered
dependents, to the extent waivable under the comparable Old Plan, and (ii)
any eligible expenses incurred by such individual and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such individual\'s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to
be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such individual    -69-   EXECUTION COPY  --------------  and his or
her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such New Plan.   5.8.5 [Reserved].   5.8.6
Savings Plan.   5.8.6.1 The Seller shall take, or cause to be taken, all
steps necessary or appropriate with respect to the Seller Savings Plan so
that, effective no later than the Closing Date: (a) the Seller Savings Plan
is sponsored solely by, or is merged into another plan sponsored solely by,
one or more of the Seller and/or any of its Affiliates (excluding the
Transferred Subsidiaries); and (b) none of the Transferred Subsidiaries is a
fiduciary with respect to the Seller Savings Plan nor an obligor or a
guarantor of any indebtedness of the Seller Savings Plan.   5.8.6.2 As of
the Closing Date, the Purchasers shall designate one or more existing defined
contribution savings plans sponsored by any of the Purchasers and their
respective Affiliates (including any Transferred Subsidiary) that are
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (such plans, collectively and
separately, the "Purchaser Savings Plan") to provide benefits to Transferred
Employees and to accept the direct cash rollovers described in the next
sentence, and the Purchasers shall provide the Seller with such assurances as
may reasonably be required by the Seller that each Purchaser Savings Plan is
so qualified. The Seller shall cause the Seller Savings Plan to be amended to
the extent necessary to provide that (a) the account balances of all
Transferred Employees shall be fully vested as of the applicable Hire
Date, (b) such account balances shall be eligible for distribution to the
Transferred Employee participants at their election in connection with their
becoming Transferred Employees, and (c) such account balances may be rolled
over in cash to a Purchaser Savings Plan in a direct or indirect rollover.
The Seller and the Purchasers shall cooperate with one another and take all
steps necessary or appropriate (which steps shall include an amendment of the
Seller Savings Plan by the Seller) so that any Transferred Employee whose
account balance under the Seller Savings Plan is not distributed and who has
any outstanding participant loans thereunder may elect, pursuant to
appropriate authorization forms completed by the Transferred Employee, to
continue to repay such loans after his or her Hire Date, for so long as such
Transferred Employee remains on the General Electric Company corporate
payroll, by having the required payments with respect to each such loan
withheld from such Transferred Employee\'s paychecks on each payroll period
and remitted to the trustee of the trust funding the Seller Savings Plan.  
5.8.6.3 The Purchasers and the Seller shall cooperate in (a) making all
filings required under the Code or ERISA and any applicable securities Laws,
(b) implementing all appropriate communications with participants, (c)
transferring appropriate records, and (d) taking all such other actions as
may be necessary and appropriate to implement the provisions of this Section
5.8.6 in a timely manner.   5.8.7 Pension Plan. As soon as practicable
following the Closing Date, the Purchasers shall designate an existing
defined benefit pension plan of the Purchasers or one of its Affiliates that
is tax qualified, to provide future benefits to Transferred Employees. The
Seller shall amend the Pension Plan of Hercules Incorporated to credit each
Transferred Employee who     -70-   EXECUTION COPY 
--------------  is, immediately before the Closing Date, a participant in
such plan with vesting service and additional age based upon his or her
service with the Purchasers and their Affiliates (including the Transferred
Subsidiaries) during the period from the Closing through the fourth
anniversary of the Closing. The Purchasers shall provide the Seller promptly,
and from time to time, with such information as it may reasonably request to
enable it to provide the service credit required by the foregoing amendment,
including the hours of service of such Transferred Employees and notice of
the termination of employment of any such Transferred Employees. The
Purchasers shall make four consecutive annual payments to the Seller of $1.2
million each, on or prior to March 31st of each calendar year beginning with
March 31, 2003, in consideration of such amendment to the Seller\'s Plan. The
Seller shall continue, or shall cause one of its Affiliates (excluding the
Transferred Subsidiaries) or one of their respective successors to continue,
the Pension Plan of Hercules Incorporated, as so amended, in effect to the
extent necessary to allow each such Transferred Employee who continues to be
employed by the Purchasers and/or their Affiliates (including the
Transferred Subsidiaries) through the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date
to accrue four additional years of vesting service under such amendment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) the Seller may terminate the Pension Plan
of Hercules Incorporated, provided that it immediately credits all such
Transferred Employees with the additional years of service and age that they
would have received through the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date,
assuming they continued to work for the Purchasers and their Affiliates
during that period, and in such event, the Purchasers shall immediately pay
to the Seller the remainder of the foregoing four payments; and (ii) if the
Seller determines that the amendment required by this Section 5.8.7 would
jeopardize the status of the Pension Plan of Hercules Incorporated as tax-
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, then the Seller and the
Purchasers shall not be obligated to comply with the provisions of this
Section 5.8.7, but they shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter
into a mutually agreeable alternative agreement so as to accomplish, as
nearly as possible, the intent hereof without jeopardizing the tax
qualification of such plan.   5.8.8 Welfare Benefits.   5.8.8.1 The Seller
and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for (a) claims for the type of
benefits described in Section 3(1) of ERISA (whether or not covered by ERISA)
under Seller Benefit Plans that are either (x) Foreign Benefit Plans for
which there are neither any book reserves nor any Funded Assets or (y) U.S.
Benefit Plans (collectively, "Welfare Benefits") that are incurred by or with
respect to any Transferred Employee before the applicable Hire Date and any
Former Business Employee at any time; (b) claims relating to COBRA Coverage
under Seller Benefit Plans attributable to "qualifying events" with respect
to any (i) Transferred Employee and his or her beneficiaries and dependents
that occur on or before the applicable Hire Date and (ii) Former Business
Employee and his or her beneficiary or dependents that occur any time; and;
(c) claims for workers compensation that are incurred by or with respect to
any Transferred Employee before the applicable Hire Date. The Purchasers and
their respective Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall be
solely responsible for (i) all other claims for Welfare Benefits with respect
to Transferred Employees (including claims relating to COBRA Coverage
attributable to "qualifying events" with respect to any Transferred Employee
and his or her beneficiaries and dependents that occur after the applicable
Hire Date), and (ii) claims for workers compensation that are incurred by or
with respect to any Transferred Employee on or after the applicable Hire
Date. For purposes of the foregoing: (A) a    -71-   EXECUTION COPY 
--------------  medical/dental claim shall be considered incurred when the
services are rendered or the supplies are provided, and not when the
condition arose; provided that claims relating to a hospital confinement that
begins before the applicable Hire Date but continues thereafter shall be
treated as incurred on or before the applicable Hire Date; (B) a disability
claim shall be considered incurred on or before the applicable Hire Date if
the injury or condition giving rise to the claim occurs on or before the
applicable Hire Date and (C) a claim for workers compensation shall be
considered to be incurred before the applicable Hire Date only if (I) it
arises solely out of an injury or condition that occurred before the
applicable Hire Date and (II) it does not involve an aggravation of an injury
or second injury that occurs on or after the applicable Hire Date.   5.8.8.2
The Seller shall transfer the accounts and experience of Transferred
Employees under Seller Benefit Plans that are health care or dependent care
flexible spending plans to health care or dependent care flexible spending
plans maintained by the Purchasers and/or any of their respective Affiliates
(including the Transferred Subsidiaries), which need not be similar to the
applicable Seller Benefit Plans, to the extent permitted by applicable plan
terms and applicable Law.   5.8.9 Certain Compensation. Except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Law, the Purchasers and their respective
Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall assume or retain,
as applicable, all Liabilities and obligations of the Seller and its
Affiliates to Transferred Employees for accrued but unused vacation
entitlements through the applicable Hire Date. In addition, the Purchasers
shall pay, or shall cause one of their respective Affiliates (including the
Transferred Subsidiaries) to pay, to each Transferred Employee who was
eligible to earn any incentive pay, bonus or similar compensation for any
period beginning before and ending on or after such Transferred Employee\'s
Hire Date, such compensation in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Benefit Plan, with such adjustments as may reasonably be necessary or
appropriate to reflect the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby without enlargement or diminishment of the Transferred Employee\'s
incentive opportunity.   5.8.10 Foreign Employees, Compensation and
Benefits.   5.8.10.1 Liabilities in General. Except as
specifically provided otherwise in this Section 5.8, (a) the Purchasers and
their respective Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall
assume or retain, as applicable, all Liabilities relating to (i) compensation
of Transferred Employees employed outside the United States of America (the
"Foreign Transferred Employees") and Foreign Former Employees or (ii) the
Water Business Benefit Plans that are Foreign Benefit Plans (the "Foreign
Water Business Benefit Plans"), in either case whether accrued before, on or
after the Closing Date, and (b) the Seller and its Affiliates (excluding the
Transferred Subsidiaries) shall assume or retain, as applicable, all
Liabilities relating to (I) compensation of their employees and former
employees who are or were employed outside the United States of America,
other than the Foreign Transferred Employees and Foreign Former Business
Employees, or (II) the Seller Benefit Plans that are Foreign Benefit Plans
(the "Foreign Seller Benefit Plans"), in either case whether accrued before,
on or after the Closing Date. The Seller and the Purchasers shall take all
steps necessary or appropriate so that, effective not later than immediately
following the Closing, and except as specifically provided in Section
5.8.10.2, the Purchasers and their respective Affiliates (including the
Transferred Subsidiaries)     -72-   EXECUTION COPY 
--------------  have assumed all obligations and Liabilities of the Seller
and its Affiliates under Employment Agreements relating to Foreign
Transferred Employees and Foreign Former Employees and all obligations and
Liabilities of the Seller under each of the Collective Bargaining Agreements,
and the Seller and its Affiliates have no further obligation or liability
with respect to any such obligations and Liabilities.   5.8.10.2. Transfer
of Undertaking. The Seller and the Purchasers acknowledge and agree that
certain transactions contemplated hereby constitute the "transfer of an
undertaking" solely in those jurisdictions that are subject to the European
Community\'s Directive 77/187/EEC and/or any similar provisions of other
applicable Law within or outside the European Community (collectively, the
"Transfer Provisions"). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section
5.8, the Seller and the Purchasers shall comply in all respects with all
Transfer Provisions in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
and to the extent that such Transfer Provisions apply thereto.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent that the
Transfer Provisions do not permit the retention by the Seller of Liabilities
for compensation or benefits that this Section 5.8 would otherwise make
the responsibility of the Seller, such liabilities and obligations shall
instead be assumed by the Purchasers, but the Seller shall indemnify the
Purchasers with respect thereto under Section 8.2.1 as if no such assumption
had been required.   5.8.10.3 Foreign Service Recognition. For all purposes
under the employee benefit plans of the Purchasers and their respective
Affiliates providing benefits primarily to Transferred Employees employed
outside the United States of America after the Closing, each such Transferred
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Seller
and its Affiliates and any predecessor employers before the Closing as
recognized by the applicable similar Seller Benefit Plans and further to the
extent and in the manner provided for under applicable Law and local custom,
except to the extent that such credit would result in a duplication of
benefits for such credited period of service.   5.8.10.4 Transfers of Plan
Assets and Liabilities. Section 5.8.10 of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule
sets forth specific agreements regarding the treatment of specific Foreign
Benefit Plans. The provisions of this Section 5.8.10.4 shall apply with
respect to Foreign Benefit Plans except to the extent inconsistent with
applicable Law or Section 5.8.10 of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule.  
5.8.10.4.1 Plans Sponsored by the Transferred Subsidiaries. Sponsorship of
each Foreign Benefit Plan that is sponsored solely by the Transferred
Subsidiaries ("Transferred Subsidiary Foreign Plans") shall be retained by
such Transferred Subsidiaries. If any Transferred Subsidiary Foreign Plan
provides benefits only to Transferred Employees and Former
Business Employees, then from and after the Closing Date, the Seller and its
Affiliates (excluding the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall have no Liabilities
in respect thereof. The liabilities, book reserves and Funded Assets, if any,
of each Transferred Subsidiary Foreign Plan that provides benefits both to
Transferred Employees and/or Former Business Employees, on the one hand, and
to other employees or former employees of the Seller and its Affiliates, on
the other hand, shall be apportioned between the Seller and its Affiliates
(excluding the Transferred Subsidiaries) and the Purchasers and their
Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) as follows. Benefit
liabilities for Transferred Employees and Foreign Former Business
Employees    -73-   EXECUTION COPY  --------------   under each such
Transferred Subsidiary Foreign Plan shall be retained by such Transferred
Subsidiary Foreign Plan or assumed by another plan sponsored by
the Purchasers or their Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries)
(each, a "Purchaser Plan"), and all other benefit liabilities thereunder
shall be assumed by a plan sponsored by the Seller or its Affiliates
(excluding the Transferred Subsidiaries) (a "Seller Plan"), provided that
such benefit liabilities shall be allocated in a different manner to the
extent required by applicable Law. If such Transferred Subsidiary Foreign
Plan has any book reserves or Funded Assets, such book reserves or Funded
Assets shall be divided between the applicable Purchaser Plan and the
applicable Seller Plan based upon the manner in which liabilities are
allocated pursuant to the preceding sentence, in accordance with Section
5.8.10.4.3 below.   5.8.10.4.2 Plans Not Sponsored by the Transferred
Subsidiaries. Sponsorship of each Foreign Benefit Plan that is not sponsored
solely by the Transferred Subsidiaries ("Seller Foreign Plans") shall be
retained by the Seller and such Affiliates. The liabilities, book reserves
and Funded Assets, if any, relating to each Seller Foreign Plan shall be
apportioned between the Seller and its Affiliates (excluding the Transferred
Subsidiaries) and the Purchasers and their Affiliates (including the
Transferred Subsidiaries) as follows. Benefit liabilities under each such
Seller Foreign Plan for Transferred Employees and Foreign Former Business
Employees shall be assumed by a Purchaser Plan, and all other benefit
liabilities thereunder shall be retained by such Seller Foreign Plan or
assumed by another Seller Plan, provided that such benefit liabilities shall
be allocated in a different manner to the extent required by applicable Law.
If such Seller Foreign Benefit has any book reserves or Funded Assets, such
book reserves or Funded Assets shall be divided between the applicable
Purchaser Plan and the applicable Seller Plan based upon the manner in which
liabilities are allocated pursuant to the preceding sentence, in accordance
with Section 5.8.10.4.3 below.   5.8.10.4.3 Allocation of Book Reserves and
Assets. Any book reserves or Funded Assets, as the case may be, of a
Transferred Subsidiary Foreign Plan or Seller Foreign Plan that is to be
divided between a Purchaser Plan and a Seller Plan shall be allocated as
follows. In the case of any such plan that is an individual account plan, the
book reserves or Funded Assets relating to each individual account shall be
allocated to the applicable Purchaser Plan or Seller Plan that assumes the
liabilities associated with such individual account. In the case of any such
plan that is funded with insurance contracts, such contracts shall be divided
and allocated between such plans in the same proportions as the funded
liabilities, to the extent reasonably practicable under the terms of such
contracts. In the case of any such plan that is a defined benefit pension
plan, such book reserves or Funded Assets shall be divided in the same
proportions as the funded liabilities, as determined in accordance with the
actuarial methods, procedures and assumptions most recently used for purposes
of funding such plan, with all liabilities and Funded Asset valuations being
determined as of the Closing Date, with such adjustments as are necessary to
reflect the payment of benefits after the Closing Date and before completion
of the allocation and delivery of such book reserves or Funded Assets;
provided, that in each case such book reserves or Funded Assets shall
be allocated on a different basis to the extent required by applicable Law or
local custom. Funded Assets other than insurance contracts shall be delivered
to the recipient plan in cash; provided, that (a) if and to the extent
delivery in cash is imprudent or illegal or would result in a material
financial detriment to the delivering   -74-   EXECUTION COPY 
--------------   plan, the recipient plan, or both, or (b) if the Seller
and the Purchasers so agree, such delivery shall be made in kind.  
5.8.10.5 (a) If any Funded Assets cannot be allocated as contemplated by the
preceding provisions of this Section 5.8.10 due to the actions or omissions
of a third party fiduciary ("Third Party Requirements"), a purchase price
adjustment equal to the Net Amount, plus interest thereon during the period
from the Closing Date through the date of payment, at the 30-day Treasury
note rate as in effect from time to time during such period, shall be paid by
the Seller to the Parent Purchaser (if the Net Amount is negative) or by the
Parent Purchaser to the Seller (if the Net Amount is positive). If the Seller
and the Parent Purchaser so agree, one or more interim payments in respect of
the Net Amount may be made before the Determination Date, in which event the
final payment in respect of the Net Amount after the Determination Date shall
take such interim payments into account.   (b) The following terms used in
this Section 5.8.10.5 shall have the following meanings:   (i) The "Net
Amount" means the excess of (1) the aggregate  Values (as defined below) of
the Funded Assets actually  allocated to each Purchaser Plan that would have
been  allocated to the corresponding Seller Plan under this Section  5.8.10,
but for such Third Party Requirements, over (2) the  aggregate Values of the
Funded Assets actually allocated to  each Seller Plan that would have been
allocated to the  corresponding Purchaser Plan under this Section 5.8.10,
but  for such Third Party Requirements. Such determinations shall  be made
using the actuarial methods, procedures and  assumptions used for purposes of
making the allocations  contemplated by this Section 5.8.10.   (ii) The
"Value" of the Funded Assets allocated to a  particular plan shall mean the
fair market value, expressed in  U.S. dollars, thereof as of the date when
the transfer of  Funded Assets to or from that plan, as the case may be,
under  this Section 5.8.10 is completed (or it is determined, as a  result
of Third Party Requirements, that no such transfer will  take place). All
necessary conversions of values into U.S.  dollars shall be made based upon
the exchange rates for  sellers of the applicable other currency, as
published in the  most recent edition of the Wall Street Journal on or
before  the Determination Date.   (iii) The "Determination Date" means the
date on which all  allocations of Funded Assets pursuant to this Section
5.8.10  (as the same may be altered as a result of Third Party 
Requirements) have been completed.   5.8.10.6 To the extent that for any
reason other than Third Party Requirements, any of the provisions of this
Section 5.8.10 cannot be implemented, or cannot be implemented practicably on
a timely basis, consistent with applicable Law or local practice or the
Transfer Provisions, or to the extent that either the Seller or the
Purchasers will be unable to provide payroll and/or benefits to any Foreign
Transferred Employees immediately following the Closing, the Seller and the
Purchasers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deal with such
matters, including, entering into a mutually agreeable transition services
agreement or      -75-   EXECUTION COPY 
--------------  plan,employee leasing arrangement, so as to accomplish, as
nearly as possible, the intent hereof and to provide a smooth transition of
pay and benefits for such Foreign Transferred Employees.   5.8.10.7 The
allocations of book reserves, Funded Assets and liabilities required by this
Section 5.8.10 with respect to each plan, and the Net Amount, shall be
determined in accordance with this Section 5.8.10.7, and the Seller and the
Purchasers shall cooperate and use all reasonable efforts so that the
required determinations and allocations are completed promptly
and efficiently. The initial determination of such allocation for each plan
and of the Net Amount shall be made by an actuary selected by the Seller (the
"Seller\'s Actuary"). The Seller, the Purchasers and an actuary selected by
the Purchasers (the "Purchaser\'s Actuary") shall each have the right to
receive all backup data and computations used by the Seller\'s Actuary to
make its determinations, and to comment upon, and consult with the Seller\'s
Actuary and each other regarding, the accuracy thereof; provided, that
neither the Purchasers nor the Purchaser\'s Actuary shall have the right to
object to the application of the actuarial methods, procedures and
assumptions required by this Section 5.8.10. If, after a period of 45 days of
such consultation and commentary with respect to the allocations with respect
to a particular plan, or with respect to the determination of the Net Amount,
the Seller\'s Actuary and the Purchaser\'s Actuary disagree about either the
amount of the book reserve or Funded Assets allocable to a particular plan or
the amount of the Net Amount (each, a "Disputed Amount"), such disagreement
shall be resolved as follows. If the Disputed Amount according to one actuary
exceeds the Disputed Amount according to the other actuary by more than
$200,000 (based upon the exchange rates for sellers of the applicable other
currency, as published in the most recent edition of the Wall Street Journal
on or before the last day of such 45-day period), then the actuaries shall
select another internationally recognized multinational actuarial firm (the
"Third Actuary") to make a final determination of such amount, which final
determination shall be completed within 45 days after it is determined that
there is a Disputed Amount, shall be computed in accordance with the
requirements of this Section 5.8.10 and shall be binding upon the Seller and
the Purchasers. In all other cases, the determination of the Disputed Amount
by the Seller\'s Actuary shall be binding upon the Seller and the Purchasers.
The fees and expenses of the Seller\'s Actuary shall be paid by the Seller;
those of the Purchaser\'s Actuary shall be paid by the Purchaser; and those
of any Third Actuary shall be paid half by the Seller and half by
the Purchaser.   5.8.11 Cooperation and Exchange of Information. The
Purchasers and the Seller shall cooperate with one another, and shall provide
each other, as promptly as practicable, with such information as the other
shall reasonably request, in order to timely and efficiently implement the
provisions of this Section 5.8. All communications by any of the Purchasers
or any of their respective Affiliates with Business Employees and Former
Business Employees regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including this Section 5.8) that are made at any time before the date hereof
and at or before the applicable Hire Date shall be approved in advance by
individuals designated by the Seller (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).   5.8.12 Costs Associated With
Organizational Restructuring Program. The Purchasers agree to reimburse the
Seller for all costs incurred by the Seller and its Affiliates pursuant to
the Seller\'s severance pay plan and practices through the Closing as a
result of implementing the Organizational Restructuring program; provided,
that such reimbursements in    -76-   EXECUTION COPY 
--------------  the aggregate shall not exceed 125% of the aggregate
projected Severance Benefits set forth in Section 3.17.4 of the Seller\'s
Disclosure Schedule.   Section 5.9 Tax Matters.   5.9.1 Tax Indemnity by
Seller. Subject to the limitation set forth in Section 8.2.6, the Seller
shall be liable for, and shall indemnify, defend and hold the Purchasers, the
Transferred Subsidiaries and any successor entities thereto or Affiliates
thereof harmless from and against, without duplication, (a) except as
provided in Section 5.9.13, all Tax liabilities of the Seller or its
Affiliates or the Transferred Subsidiaries or with respect to the Transferred
Assets for any Pre-Closing Period or imposed on the steps set forth in Part B
of Section 5.21 of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule (other than
Tax liability arising as a result of the application of Treasury Regulation
ss. 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law),
(b) any Tax that is imposed on the Reorganization including Transfer Taxes
imposed on the Reorganization (provided that the Seller shall be treated as
having paid to the Purchasers the Estimated Reorganization Tax Amount minus
the amount, if any, paid by the Purchasers to the Seller pursuant to Section
5.9.16 plus the amount, if any, paid by the Seller to the Purchasers (or on
behalf of the Purchasers or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries) pursuant to
Section 5.9.16), (c) any Tax liability of the Transferred Subsidiaries for a
Pre-Closing Period arising as a result of the application of Treasury
Regulation ss. 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law to the extent such Tax liability arises from inclusion of any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries in the Consolidated Group of which the Seller or
Betz (or any Subsidiary of the Seller or Betz with respect to taxable periods
during which such Subsidiary is or was a Subsidiary of the Seller or Betz) is
or was the common parent (which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not include
any Consolidated Group of which an entity set forth on Section 5.9.1 of the
Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule (or any Affiliate thereof with respect to
taxable periods during which such Affiliate was an Affiliate of an entity set
forth on Section 5.9.1 of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule) is or was the
common parent), (d) any and all Taxes imposed on or with respect to
the Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities, (e) any Tax liability that
would not have arisen but for a breach or inaccuracy in any of the
representations contained in Sections 3.7.7(A) or (C), 3.7.8 or 3.7.13 in
each case determined without regard to materiality or any breach by the
Seller of any covenant or agreement of the Seller contained in Section 2.6 or
this Section 5.9, (f) any Tax for which the Seller is responsible pursuant to
Section 5.9.13, (g) an amount equal to any liability to Tax to which
BetzDearborn Limited or Hercules GB Holdings Limited (together, the "UK

consequence of service of a notice on either of them under s190 UK Taxation
of Chargeable Gains Act 1992) in respect of unpaid Tax arising from the
application of s179 U.K. Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 as a result of
transactions undertaken in connection with the Reorganization or the sale of
Betz Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, or (II) as a result of the UK
Transferred Subsidiaries being or having been a member of a value added Tax
group which includes or included Hercules Limited or Hercules Investments
Global, provided that this indemnity shall not extend to any value added Tax
for which the UK Transferred Subsidiaries would have been liable had they
been registered for value added Tax and not been members of the said VAT
group and (h) any Tax for which the Seller is responsible under Exhibit VII
hereto (collectively, "Excluded Taxes") provided, however, that
Excluded Taxes shall not include and neither the Seller nor any Seller
Affiliate shall be liable for (I) any Tax liability that would not have
arisen    -77-   EXECUTION COPY  --------------   but for a breach by
the Purchasers of any covenant or agreement of the Purchasers contained in
Section 2.6 or this Section 5.9 or Part C of Section 5.21 of the Seller\'s
Disclosure Schedule, or (II) any Tax for which the Purchaser is responsible
under Exhibit VII hereto.   5.9.2 Tax Indemnity by Purchasers. The
Purchasers shall be liable for, and shall indemnify, defend and hold the
Seller and any successor entities thereto or Affiliates thereof harmless from
and against any and all Taxes, other than Excluded Taxes, of or with respect
to the Transferred Subsidiaries, the Transferred Assets, the Purchasers or
any of their respective Affiliates and any Tax for which the Purchasers are
responsible pursuant to Section 5.9.13.   5.9.3 Tax Returns. (a) The Seller
shall prepare and file or cause to be filed when due:   (i) all Tax Returns
that are required to be filed (taking into account extensions) by or with
respect to the Transferred Subsidiaries or the Transferred Assets on or
before the Closing Date (or such later date, if any, as such Transferred
Subsidiary or Transferred Asset is transferred to the Purchaser or its
Designated Affiliate);   (ii) all Tax Returns of the Seller or any of the
Seller Entities;   (iii) all Tax Returns that relate exclusively to Excluded
Assets and Excluded Liabilities; and   (iv) all Tax Returns relating to
Taxes of a Consolidated Group that includes the Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) on the one hand, and
any of the Transferred Subsidiaries on the other hand  and the Seller shall
remit (or cause to be remitted) any Taxes due with respect to such Tax
Returns. To the extent any Tax Returns the Seller is responsible
for preparing pursuant to this Section 5.9.3(a) relate to any portion of the
Water Business, such Tax Returns shall be prepared (including with respect to
Tax elections and Tax accounting methods) in a manner consistent with the
prior practice of the Seller, the Seller Entity, the Transferred Subsidiary
or such other applicable Affiliate of the Seller and in accordance with
applicable Law; provided, however, that (I) the Seller shall have no
obligation to prepare any such Tax Return consistent with such prior practice
if (a) deviating from prior practice would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Water Business for the Post-Closing Period
or (b) the return filing position that would be inconsistent with prior
practice primarily affects the Seller (or Seller Affiliate) businesses other
than the Water Business or is contemplated in connection with the
Reorganization or is required by Law and (II) the Seller may elect to
reattribute losses of any Transferred Subsidiary to the Seller or
its Affiliate under Treasury Regulation ss. 1.1502-20(g) or any comparable
provision of state, local or foreign Law or make an election under
alternative or substitute Tax Laws that are applied or promulgated in lieu of
Treasury Regulation ss. 1.1502-20.   (b) Following the Closing, the Parent
Purchaser, at its own expense, shall file or cause to be filed when due all
Tax Returns of or with respect to any of the Transferred Subsidiaries and any
of the Transferred Assets that the Seller is not obligated to prepare
pursuant to Section 5.9.3(a) (a "Section 5.9.3(b) Return") and, subject to
Section 5.9.3(c), shall remit (or    -78-   EXECUTION COPY 
--------------  cause to be remitted) any Taxes due with respect to such Tax
Returns. To the extent that any Taxes shown due on any such Tax Return are
indemnifiable by the Seller, such Tax Return shall be prepared (including
with respect to Tax elections and Tax accounting methods) in a manner
consistent with prior practice of the Transferred Subsidiary or with respect
to the Transferred Asset and in accordance with applicable Law, and the
Parent Purchaser shall consult with the Seller regularly with respect to the
preparation of any such Tax Returns. The Parent Purchaser shall provide to
the Seller not later than 30 Business Days before the due date for filing
such Tax Returns (including extensions thereof) a copy of such Tax Return,
together with a statement setting forth the amount of Tax for which the
Parent Purchaser believes the Seller is responsible (the "Statement"). The
Seller shall have the right to review such Tax Return and the Statement prior
to the filing of such Tax Return. The Seller and the Parent Purchaser agree
to consult and resolve in good faith any issue arising as a result of the
review of such Tax Return and the Statement and to endeavor to mutually
consent to the filing as promptly as possible of such Tax Return. In the
event the parties are unable to resolve any dispute within 15 Business
Days following the Seller\'s receipt of such Tax Return and the Statement,
the Seller and the Parent Purchaser shall jointly request the Independent
Accountant to resolve any issue in dispute as promptly as possible consistent
with the principle that Tax Returns are to be prepared in a manner consistent
with prior practice of the Transferred Subsidiary or with respect to the
Transferred Asset and in accordance with applicable Law (the "Principle"). If
the Independent Accountant is unable to make a determination with respect to
any disputed issue within five Business Days prior to the due date (including
extensions) for the filing of the Tax Return in question, then the Parent
Purchaser may file or cause to be filed such Tax Return on the due date
(including extensions) therefor without such determination having been made
and without the Seller\'s consent. Notwithstanding the filing of such Tax
Return, the Independent Accountant shall make a determination with respect to
any disputed issue, and the amount of Taxes for which the Seller is
responsible shall be as determined by the Independent Accountant consistent
with the Principle. To the extent any Tax Return filed by the Parent
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries) includes Taxes for which the Seller has an indemnification
obligation pursuant to Section 5.9.1(b) (a "Reorganization Tax Return"),
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.9.3(b), the Parent
Purchaser shall consult with the Seller regularly with respect to
the preparation of any such Tax Returns and such Tax Returns shall be
prepared (as they relate to Taxes imposed on the Reorganization) (i) in a
manner that reflects a Tax Liability consistent with valuing the Excluded
Assets transferred from the Transferred Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Reorganization consistent with the values assigned to such assets on Section
5.9.3(b) of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule and (ii) consistent with any
Tax Return filing position selected by the Seller; provided, however, in the
case of a Reorganization Tax Return, if (A) no reasonable basis exists for
utilizing the values assigned in Section 5.9.3(b) of the Seller\'s Disclosure
Schedule or utilizing such values would reasonably be expected to result in
the imposition of penalties by a Taxing Authority or (B) no reasonable basis
exists for a Tax Return filing position selected by the Seller or such
position would reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of
penalties by a Taxing Authority, then the disputed value or the disputed Tax
Return filing position, as the case may be, shall be determined pursuant to
the procedure set forth in the preceding sentences of this Section 5.9.3(b),
provided further, however, that, in such event, the Independent Accountant
shall not make its determination consistent with the Principle but instead
shall make its determination consistent with a value or Tax Return filing
position, as the case may be, that will (x) minimize the Seller\'s
indemnification obligation    -79-   EXECUTION COPY 
--------------   pursuant to Section 5.9.1(b) and (y) result in a value or
a Tax Return filing position for which there is a reasonable basis and which
would not reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of penalties by
a Taxing Authority.   (c) The Seller shall, subject to Section 5.9.3(b), pay
to the Parent Purchaser (or its Designated Affiliate) the amount of Taxes
with respect to which the Seller is responsible shown due on a Section
5.9.3(b) Return two Business Days before the due date for the payment of
Taxes with respect to such Tax Return (provided, however, that the Seller
shall be deemed to have paid the Purchasers the Estimated Reorganization Tax
Amount for any Taxes for which the Seller has an indemnification obligation
pursuant to Section 5.9.1(b) and shall be obligated to pay the Parent
Purchaser (or its Designated Affiliate) for Taxes imposed on the
Reorganization under this Section 5.9.3(c) only to the extent Taxes for which
the Seller has an indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 5.9.1(b)
exceed the Estimated Reorganization Tax Amount). If a dispute arises with
respect to any Section 5.9.3(b) Return, the Seller shall pay to the
Parent Purchaser (or its Designated Affiliate) an amount equal to the Taxes
with respect to which the Seller is responsible shown due on the Tax Return
which are not in dispute. Such dispute shall be submitted to the Independent
Accountant in accordance with Section 5.9.3(b), and upon resolution of any
such dispute the Seller shall pay to the Parent Purchaser, or the Parent
Purchaser shall pay the Seller, any amount necessary to reflect the
Independent Accountant\'s determination. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Seller shall be deemed to have satisfied its indemnity
obligations pursuant to the applicable subsection of Section 5.9.1 (and no
duplicative payment shall be due) to the extent of all payments pursuant to
this Section 5.9.3(c), provided that no payment pursuant to this Section
5.9.3(c) shall excuse the Seller from its indemnity obligations pursuant to
Section 5.9.1 if the amount of Taxes ultimately determined (on audit or
otherwise) for the periods covered by such Tax Return exceeds the payments
made pursuant to this Section 5.9.3(c).   (d) To the extent permitted by Law
or administrative practice, the taxable year of each of the Transferred
Subsidiaries that includes the Closing Date shall be treated as closing at
the close of business on the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement,
where it is necessary to apportion between the Seller and the Purchasers the
Tax liability of an entity or with respect to a Transferred Asset for a
Straddle Period (which is not treated under the immediately preceding
sentence as closing immediately after the close of business on the Closing
Date), such liability shall be apportioned between the period deemed to end
at the close of business on the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Straddle
Period") and the period deemed to begin at the beginning of the day following
the Closing Date (the "Post-Closing Straddle Period") on the basis of an
interim closing of the books (provided that property Taxes with respect to a
Transferred Asset shall be apportioned on the basis of the number of days in
the Pre-Closing Straddle Period relative to the number of days in
the Straddle Period).   (e) The Seller shall be entitled to any Tax Benefit
arising from any deduction arising in respect of an Excluded Liability or
Excluded Tax and the Purchasers acknowledge and agree that neither the
Purchasers nor any of their Affiliates shall claim any such deduction on any
Section 5.9.3(b) Return; provided, however, that if any deduction arising in
respect of an Excluded Liability or Excluded Tax is not permitted by Law or
administrative practice to be reported in a Tax Return for which the Seller
has filing responsibility and is permitted by Law or    -80-   EXECUTION
COPY  --------------  administrative practice to be reported in a Section
5.9.3(b) Return, then the Purchasers shall claim such deduction and pay to
Seller the amount of any Tax Benefit actually realized in cash that results
from such deduction and that would not have arisen but for such
deduction.   5.9.4 Tax Contests. (a) If a notice of deficiency,
proposed adjustment, assessment, audit, examination or other administrative
or court proceeding, suit, dispute or other claim by, before or against a
Taxing Authority (a "Tax Audit") shall be delivered, sent, commenced or
initiated, in writing, to or against the Seller, the Purchasers or any of
their respective Affiliates (a "Notified Party") by any Taxing Authority with
respect to Taxes for which the other party may reasonably be expected to be
liable pursuant to Sections 5.9.1 or 5.9.2, the Notified Party shall notify
the other party in writing of such Tax Audit; provided, however, that the
failure to provide prompt notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
other party of its indemnity obligations except to the extent that such other
party is actually prejudiced thereby.   (b) From and after the date hereof,
the Seller shall have the sole right, at its own expense, to control,
contest, resolve, settle and defend, and represent each of the Transferred
Subsidiaries\' interests in, any Tax Audit to the extent such Tax Audit
relates to any Excluded Taxes (and any Tax Audit of any Consolidated Group of
which the Seller (or any successor thereto or parent company thereof) is the
common parent) and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense; provided,
however, that if such Tax Audit (A) is for a Tax Return that is not referred
to in Section 5.9.3(a)(iii) and is not referred to in Section 5.9.3(a)(iv)
and is not a Tax Audit of any Consolidated Group of which the Seller (or any
successor thereto or parent company thereof) is the common parent and (B)
would bind the Transferred Subsidiaries with respect to the Post-Closing
Period and (C) would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Water Business for the Post-Closing Period, then there shall be no
settlement with respect thereto without the consent of the Parent Purchaser,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld (provided that if the Parent
Purchaser withholds consent, then the Seller\'s responsibility for Taxes
shall be no greater than it would have been under the proposed settlement);
provided further, however, that with respect to (I) any Tax Audit relating to
any Tax liability of the Transferred Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Period
arising as a result of the application of Treasury Regulation ss. 1.1502-6 or
any similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law for which the Seller
is not obligated to indemnify the Purchasers pursuant to Section 5.9.1(c) or
(II) a claim with respect to a Deferred Business in a Tax Audit of any
Consolidated Group of which Parent Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(other than a Transferred Subsidiary) is the common parent, the Purchasers
shall have the sole right (as between the Purchasers and the Seller) to
conduct, contest, resolve, settle and defend and represent each of the
Transferred Subsidiaries\' interests (except that, in the case of clause (II)
, (x) Parent Purchaser shall defend any such claim in good faith and on the
same basis as if Parent Purchaser were the party in interest with respect to
such claim and (y) Seller\'s responsibility for Excluded Taxes in connection
with any such Tax Audit shall be determined by the Independent Accountant
taking into account the reasonableness of the settlement in light of the
merits of the claim).   (c) In the case of a Tax Audit for a Straddle
Period, the Seller (if the Tax Audit involves the Reorganization or if the
claim for Taxes that are Excluded Taxes exceeds or reasonably could be
expected to exceed in amount the claim for Taxes that are not Excluded Taxes)
or otherwise the Purchasers (the Seller or the Purchasers, as the case may
be, the   -81-   EXECUTION COPY  --------------   "Controlling Party")
shall be entitled to control all proceedings taken in connection with the
defense of such Tax Audit; provided, however, that the other party (the "Non-
Controlling Party") shall be entitled to participate fully (at the Non-
Controlling Party\'s expense) in the conduct of such Tax Audit, and
the Controlling Party shall not settle any such Tax Audit without the Non-
Controlling Party\'s consent (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld) (provided that if the Non-Controlling Party withholds
consent, then the Controlling Party\'s responsibility for Taxes shall be no
greater than it would have been under the proposed settlement). For the
avoidance of doubt, the above provisions of this Section 5.9.4(c) shall not
apply to any Tax Audit for any Tax Return referred to in Section
5.9.3(a)(iii) or (iv); such Tax Audits instead shall be governed by Section
5.9.4(b).   (d) The Purchasers shall have the sole right, at their own
expense, to control any other Tax Audit (not relating to an Excluded Tax),
and contest, resolve, settle and defend against any other assessment, notice
of deficiency, or other adjustment or proposed adjustment relating to any and
all Taxes with respect to the Transferred Subsidiaries or the Transferred
Assets.   5.9.5 Refunds, Credits and Carrybacks. (a) Except as
otherwise provided in Sections 5.9.5(d) or 5.9.15, the Seller shall be
entitled to any refunds or credits (including foreign Tax credits) of or
against or arising from, or that may be used against, Excluded Taxes.   (b)
Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.9.5(d) or 5.9.15, the Purchasers
and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall be entitled to any refunds or credits
(including foreign Tax credits) of or against or arising from, or that may be
used against, Taxes of the Transferred Subsidiaries, other than refunds or
credits of or against or arising from, or that may be used against,
Excluded Taxes.   (c) The Purchasers shall cause the Transferred
Subsidiaries promptly to forward to the Seller or to reimburse the Seller for
any refunds or credits due the Seller (pursuant to the terms of this Section
5.9) after receipt thereof, and the Seller shall promptly forward to the
Purchasers or reimburse the Purchasers for any refunds or credits due the
Purchasers (pursuant to the terms of this Section 5.9) after receipt thereof,
in each case net of any Taxes attributable to the receipt of such refunds or
credits.   (d) To the extent that the Transferred Subsidiaries carry back
any item of loss, deduction or credit which arises in any taxable period
ending after the Closing Date (and, in the case of a Straddle Period, arises
in the Post-Closing Straddle Period) and which relates to or affects any
Excluded Tax into a Pre-Closing Period, the Purchasers shall be entitled to
any Tax Benefit actually realized in cash that results from such carry back
and that would not have arisen but for such carry back; provided, however,
that (i) the amount required to be paid pursuant to this Section 5.9.5(d)
shall be recalculated at any time that facts or circumstances arise or come
to light which affect the amount required to be paid pursuant to this Section
5.9.5(d) and (ii) if such facts or circumstances arise or come to light after
any payment by the Seller to the Purchasers under this Section 5.9.5(d)
which, if known when such payment was made would have eliminated the
Seller\'s obligation to make such payment or reduced the amount of such
payment, the Purchasers shall be required to remit to the Seller in cash an
amount equal to the excess of (x) the amount of the payment made by the
Seller to the Purchasers under this Section 5.9.5(d) over    -82-  
EXECUTION COPY  --------------  (y) the amount, if any, that would have
been paid by the Seller under this Section 5.9.5(d) had all of the facts and
circumstances been known at the time such payment was made.   5.9.6
Cooperation and Exchange of Information. (a) The Purchasers shall, and shall
cause the Transferred Subsidiaries to, deliver to the Seller all information
(including IRS Form 1120 prepared on a separate basis in accordance with past
practice, together with schedules, statements and supporting documentation)
as the Seller may reasonably request from time to time, with respect to each
of the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Transferred Assets for the
preparation of the income Tax Returns of the Seller for calendar years 2001
and 2002. All information provided by the Purchasers and the Transferred
Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 5.9.6(a) shall correctly reflect, to
the knowledge of the Purchasers or the relevant Transferred Subsidiary, as
the case may be, the facts regarding the income, properties, operations and
status of each of the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Transferred Assets,
and shall be prepared in a manner consistent with (i) the past practice of
each such entity, and (ii) Section 2.6 of the Seller\'s Disclosure
Schedule.   (b) The Purchasers shall provide the Seller with reasonable
cooperation and shall make available to the Seller such information and data
concerning the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Transferred Assets and make
available such knowledgeable employees of the Transferred Subsidiaries as the
Seller may reasonably request, and shall provide the Seller with reasonable
access to any relevant Tax records or information in the Purchasers\'
possession. Such cooperation and information shall include promptly
forwarding copies of appropriate notices and forms or other communications
received from or sent to any Taxing Authority which relate to the Transferred
Subsidiaries and providing copies of all relevant Tax Returns, together with
accompanying schedules and related work papers, documents relating to rulings
or other determinations by any Taxing Authority and any existing records
concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property which the Purchasers and
the Transferred Subsidiaries may possess. The Purchasers, and the Transferred
Subsidiaries shall make their employees and facilities available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide explanation of any documents or
information provided hereunder. The Seller and its Affiliates shall provide
the Purchasers with similar reasonable cooperation, information and data to
the extent that the Seller or any of its Affiliates has such records and
information in its possession or such employees in its employ.   (c) For a
period of 10 years after the Closing Date, or until expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations if later, the Seller, the Purchasers and
the Transferred Subsidiaries shall retain all Tax Returns, books and records
(including computer files) of, or with respect to, the
Transferred Subsidiaries and the Transferred Assets ("Retained Tax
Documents") for all Pre-Closing Periods; provided, however, that (i) no party
shall be required to retain any Retained Tax Documents for any taxable period
ending on or before December 31, 1995 and (ii) either party shall be entitled
to dispose of any Retained Tax Documents provided they have first offered
such Retained Tax Documents to the other parties hereto in writing and the
other parties hereto fail to accept such offer within 60 days of its being
made.   (d) The Purchasers and the Seller and their respective Affiliates
shall cooperate in the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns relating in
whole or in part to taxable periods ending on or before or including the
Closing Date that are required or requested by the Seller to be filed after
such date. In the case of any federal, state or local or foreign
Consolidated    -83-   EXECUTION COPY  --------------  Group Tax
Returns, such cooperation shall also relate to any other taxable periods in
which one party hereto could reasonably require the assistance of the other
parties hereto in obtaining any necessary information. Such cooperation shall
include furnishing prior years\' Tax Returns or return preparation
packages illustrating previous reporting practices or containing historical
information relevant to the preparation of such Tax Returns, and furnishing
such other information within such party\'s possession requested by the party
filing such Tax Returns as is relevant to their preparation; provided,
however, that neither the Seller and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates nor the
Purchasers and their Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall be required to provide
any Person with any Consolidated Group Tax Return or copy thereof that
includes the Seller or any of its Affiliates or the Purchasers and any of
their Affiliates, as the case may be. To the extent that such Tax Returns
would be required to be delivered but for the proviso in the preceding
sentence, the Person that would be required to deliver such Tax Returns shall
instead deliver pro forma Tax Returns relating solely to the Transferred
Subsidiaries or the Transferred Assets, as the case may be.   5.9.7
Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements. As of the Closing Date, the Seller
shall cause all Tax allocation, Tax sharing, Tax reimbursement and similar
agreements and arrangements between the Seller and its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and the Transferred Subsidiaries, on the other, to be extinguished and
terminated with respect to the Transferred Subsidiaries, and any rights
or obligations existing under any such agreement or arrangement shall
be extinguished and no longer enforceable.   5.9.8 No Section 338
Elections. Neither the Seller, the Purchasers, nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall make or cause to be made any election under Section 338 of
the Code with respect to the purchase of the Transferred Subsidiaries.  
5.9.9 Coordination. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, in the event there is a conflict between Section 2.6 or this
Section 5.9, on the one hand, and any other provision(s) of this Agreement,
on the other hand, Section 2.6 and this Section 5.9 shall control; provided,
however, that if any provision of this Section 5.9 would result in the
payment by the Seller or any of its Affiliates (excluding the Transferred
Subsidiaries) of any amount that is made, pursuant to Section 5.8, the
responsibility of the Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates
(including the Transferred Subsidiaries), or for which the Purchasers or any
of their respective Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries), are
required to reimburse the Seller and its Affiliates (excluding the
Transferred Subsidiaries), the provisions of Section 5.8 shall govern rather
than those of this Section 5.9.   5.9.10 Survival. The representations and
warranties contained in Section 3.7.7(A) and (C), 3.7.8 and 3.7.13 and the
agreements, covenants and indemnities contained in this Section 5.9 shall
survive the Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable statutory
periods of limitation. The remaining representations and warranties contained
in Section 3.7 shall not survive the Closing.   5.9.11 Tax Treatment of
Payments. The Seller, the Purchasers, the Transferred Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates shall treat any and all payments under Sections 5.8.7,
5.8.10.7, this Section 5.9 or Section 8.2 as an adjustment to purchase price
for Tax purposes (which treatment the Purchasers and the Seller acknowledge
is consistent with current Tax Law)    -84-   EXECUTION COPY 
--------------  unless they are required to treat such payments otherwise as
a result of a change in applicable Tax Law or interpretation thereof in a
court case or binding Treasury Regulation, in which case the indemnifying
party\'s indemnification obligation shall be (i) increased such that the
indemnification payment less any Tax actually paid in cash by the indemnified
party with respect to such indemnification payment equals the Damages giving
rise to such indemnification and (ii) decreased by any Tax Benefit actually
realized in cash by the indemnified party that would not have been realized
but for the Damages giving rise to the indemnification payment. If a Tax or
Tax Benefit is actually paid or realized in cash by the indemnified party
subsequent to the time when an indemnification payment is made hereunder, the
amount required to be paid pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) shall be
recalculated and an appropriate adjusting payment shall be paid by the
indemnifying party to the indemnified party or by the indemnified party to
the indemnifying party promptly after such Tax or Tax Benefit is actually
paid or realized in cash.   5.9.12 Where it is necessary to determine the
taxable period (or portion thereof) to which a Tax relates, such
determination shall be made under applicable Tax Law and the rules set forth
in this Section 5.9, not under principles of financial accounting.
Notwithstanding any other provision, it is hereby agreed and understood that
the Seller makes no representation as to the amount, quality or nature of Tax
basis, net operating loss, credits or other Tax assets or benefits that may
exist at any time in or with respect to the Transferred Subsidiaries or the
Transferred Assets ("Tax Attributes"), the Seller may utilize (or cause to be
utilized) any Tax Attributes for Seller\'s benefit at the Seller\'s sole
discretion to the extent permitted by Law, in the Reorganization or otherwise
to minimize Excluded Taxes, without any obligation to compensate the
Purchasers for such utilization, the Purchasers may not withhold consent to
any transaction contemplated by the Seller in connection with the
Reorganization or otherwise by reason of the utilization,
disallowance, limitation on or unavailability of any Tax Attributes and the
accounting made for purposes of Section 5.21 shall not include the
utilization, disallowance, limitation on or unavailability of any Tax
Attributes.   5.9.13 Transfer Taxes. Each of the Seller (or the relevant
Seller Affiliate, as applicable) and the Parent Purchaser (or the relevant
Parent Purchaser Affiliate, as applicable) shall pay one-half of all
documentary, sales, use, registration, foreign notary, value added, transfer,
stamp and similar Taxes, fees and costs (collectively, "Transfer Taxes")
payable as a result of the transfer of the Transferred Assets and the
Transferred Subsidiaries to the Purchasers or their Affiliates and the other
transactions (other than the Reorganization) contemplated by this Agreement
(other than value added Taxes, all of which will be the responsibility of and
be paid by the Purchasers, except value added Taxes imposed on the
Reorganization, all of which shall be the responsibility of the Seller),
other than income Taxes or Taxes on capital gain or loss. The Parent
Purchaser (or the relevant Parent Purchaser Affiliate, as applicable) will
file with the relevant authorities and do all such things as are necessary in
the relevant jurisdictions to ensure the prompt completion and, where
necessary, registration and stamping of the transfer of the Transferred
Assets to the Purchasers. Neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall
be liable to pay any proportion of any additional Taxes, penalties, interest
or similar costs incurred by the delay, failure or default of the Parent
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to comply with its filing, registration
and stamping obligations under this Section 5.9.13.    -85-   EXECUTION
COPY  --------------    5.9.14 Post-Closing Transactions. For any
Transferred Subsidiary that is organized in a jurisdiction other than the
United States (a "Foreign Transferred Subsidiary"), for the taxable period
that includes the Closing Date, neither the Purchasers nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall cause or permit such Foreign Transferred
Subsidiary to enter into any transaction or take any action (a) that would be
considered under the Code to constitute the declaration or payment of a
dividend, including pursuant to Section 304 of the Code or (b) that would
otherwise result in the diminution of the foreign Tax credits that, absent
any such transaction, may be claimed by the Seller or any of its Affiliates,
including any transaction (other than in the Ordinary Course of Business)
that would result in the increase or diminution of any amount of earnings and
profits of such Foreign Transferred Subsidiary under the Code for periods
through the end of any such taxable period or any loss carryback or
loss surrender or other action not in the Ordinary Course of Business that
would reduce the effective rate of creditable Tax paid by such Foreign
Transferred Subsidiary for any such period.   5.9.15 Timing Differences.
The Purchasers agree that if as the result of any Tax Audit adjustment made
with respect to any Excluded Tax, the Purchasers or any of their Affiliates,
including the Transferred Subsidiaries, receive a Tax Benefit, then the
Purchasers shall pay to the Seller the amount of such Tax Benefit within 15
days of filing the Tax Return in which such Tax Benefit is realized or
utilized (or such later date, such as upon resolution of a Tax Audit, as the
Tax Benefit is received). The Seller agrees that if as the result of any Tax
Audit adjustment made with respect to any Taxes of the Transferred
Subsidiaries or with respect to the Transferred Assets, in each case, other
than an Excluded Tax, the Seller or any of its Affiliates receives a Tax
Benefit, then the Seller shall pay to the Purchasers the amount of such
Tax Benefit within 15 days of filing the Tax Return in which such Tax Benefit
is realized or utilized (or such later date, such as upon resolution of a
Tax Audit, as the Tax Benefit is received). For purposes of determining the
amount and timing of any Tax Benefit, the recipient of the Tax Benefit shall
be deemed to pay Tax at the highest marginal rate in effect in the year such
Tax Benefit is realized or utilized and shall be deemed to realize or utilize
any Tax Benefit in the first taxable year that such Tax Benefit may be
realized or utilized under the Law. The Purchasers and the Seller agree that
they will use all reasonable means available to seek any available Tax
Benefit (including seeking it in a Tax Audit), provided, however, that
nothing contained in this Section 5.9.15 shall obligate the Seller, the
Purchasers or any of their Affiliates to file any amended Tax Returns.  
5.9.16 Reorganization Tax True-Up. Within 10 Business Days following the
filing by the Purchasers of the last Section 5.9.3(b) Return (not
including any amended Tax Return) that includes Taxes for which the Seller
has an indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 5.9.1(b) (but in no
event after December 31, 2003), the Purchasers shall remit to the Seller the
amount, if any, by which the Estimated Reorganization Tax Amount exceeds the
total amount of Taxes imposed on the Reorganization that are shown due on all
then filed Section 5.9.3(b) Returns. The Seller shall remit to the Purchasers
the amount, if any, by which the total amount of Taxes imposed on the
Reorganization that are shown due on all Section 5.9.3(b) Returns that
include Taxes for which the Seller has an indemnification obligation pursuant
to Section 5.9.1(b) exceeds the Estimated Reorganization Tax Amount in
accordance with Section 5.9.3(c). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, no payment by the Purchasers or the    -86-   EXECUTION COPY 
--------------  Seller pursuant to this Section 5.9.16 shall excuse the
Seller or the Purchasers from their respective indemnity obligations pursuant
to Section 5.9.1 or 5.9.2.   5.9.17 UK Taxation. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary (i) any Tax losses sustained by Hercules GB
Holdings Limited relating to interest payments for the Pre-Closing Period
shall be surrendered, to the extent determined by the Seller, to Hercules
Limited without payment in accordance with and subject to the UK Tax rules
relating to group relief set out in Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988
Section 402 to 413 and Schedule 18, (ii) any Tax losses sustained by Hercules
GB Holdings Limited relating to interest payments for the Pre-Closing Period
that are not surrendered to Hercules Limited pursuant to clause (i) of this
Section 5.9.17 shall be surrendered to BetzDearborn Limited in accordance
with and subject to the said rules relating to group relief and (iii) the
Purchasers, Hercules GB Holdings Limited and BetzDearborn Limited shall take
all action that is reasonably required to enable such surrender to take place
and for Hercules Limited and/or BetzDearborn Limited to obtain such loss
relief as is permissible under the said rules, including signature of any
necessary group relief consents and any amendments to Tax Returns for
Hercules GB Holdings Limited or BetzDearborn Limited relating to the Pre-
Closing Period.   5.9.18 Deferred Businesses. In the case of a Deferred
Business in the United States as to which the Seller is the Transferee
(within the meaning of Exhibit VII), the Seller shall take such steps as are
necessary for it to file, and the Seller and the Purchasers shall file, their
respective United States federal income Tax Returns (and corresponding United
States state and local income Tax Returns) on the basis that such Deferred
Business is not a Deferred Business. In the case of a Deferred Business that
is not in the United States, the parties, acting reasonably, shall endeavor
to report such Deferred Business (or cause it to be reported) on the relevant
foreign income Tax Returns as not a Deferred Business.   Section 5.10
Ancillary Agreements.   5.10.1 Blanket Assignment of Leases. At the Closing,
the Seller Entities and the Purchaser will enter into the Assignment of
Leases ("Blanket Assignment of Leases") by which (a) the Seller Entities will
transfer and assign all of their respective right, title and interest in each
Leased Real Property listed in Section 2.2.1 of the Seller\'s Disclosure
Schedule to be transferred to the Purchaser, and (b) the Purchaser will
assume all obligations and liabilities under the applicable Real Property
Leases.   5.10.2 Local Assignment of Leases. At the Closing, to the
extent required by the lessor of any Leased Real Property or custom and/or
applicable Law of the jurisdiction in which any Leased Real Property is
located, the Seller Entities and the Purchaser will enter into any other
local assignment of lease relating to the Leased Real Property ("Local
Assignment of Leases"), in substantially the same form as the Blanket
Assignment of Leases or with such other changes as are required by local
custom or applicable Law, provided that no such changes shall increase the
Seller Entities\' rights or obligations as set forth in the Blanket
Assignment of Leases.   5.10.3 Supply Agreements. At the Closing, the Seller
and Betz will enter into the Supply Agreements, the purpose of which is to,
among other things, provide continuity of supply     -87-   EXECUTION

products produced at Water Business facilities transferring to the Purchaser
as part of the Transferred Assets and (b) to Betz, of those Water Business
products produced at Retained Business facilities remaining with the Seller

products for resale to customers in the Pulp and Paper Industry worldwide.  
5.10.5 Intellectual Property Assignments and Intellectual Property License
Agreements. At the Closing, the Seller and the Purchaser will enter into the
Intellectual Property Assignments and Intellectual Property

protect the Seller\'s and its Affiliates\' rights in any and all of the
Intellectual Property Rights owned or otherwise used by the Seller and its
Affiliates as of the Closing Date and remaining with the Seller and its
Affiliates as part of the Retained Business (the "Retained Business

Property transferring to the Purchaser as part of the Transferred Assets, (c)
grant the Seller and its Affiliates the rights necessary to use any Purchased

rights necessary to use the Retained Business Intellectual Property Rights
that have been or are being used in the Water Business as of the date of this
Agreement so that the Purchaser can continue to use such Retained Business
Intellectual Property Rights in the Water Business after the Closing
Date.   5.10.6 Transition Services Agreement. At the Closing, the Seller
and Betz shall enter into the Transition Services Agreement, the purpose of
which is to, among other things, ensure that (i) to the extent requested and
agreed by the Purchasers, the Seller and its Affiliates provide to Betz and
its Affiliates after the Closing the scope and level of services, support and
facilities use which is currently provided by the Seller Entities to the
Water Business and which are reasonably necessary to conduct and operate the
Water Business as presently conducted and operated, and, (ii) to the extent
requested and agreed by the Seller, Betz and its Affiliates provide to the

certain of such services, for such shorter period as provided for in the
Transition Services Agreement. The parties hereto agree to negotiate
reasonable and customary terms of the Transition Services Agreement and
related attachments in good faith.   5.10.7 Other Ancillary Agreements. On
or prior to the Closing, (a) the Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver to the Seller copies of any
other Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party and (b) the Seller shall,
and shall cause their Affiliates to, execute and deliver to the Purchaser

-88-   EXECUTION COPY  --------------   Section 5.11 Assignment of
Insurance Proceeds. Effective upon the Closing, (a) the Seller shall (and
shall cause the other Seller Entities to) assign and transfer to the
Purchasers or their designees all claims, causes of action, rights of
recovery and rights of set-off of any kind arising under any contract of
insurance or by operation of Law to the extent in favor of or pertaining
to the Water Business or any portion thereof (other than rights in favor of
or pertaining to the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities); and (b)
the Purchasers shall (and shall cause their Affiliates to) assign and
transfer to the Seller or its designees all claims, causes of action, rights
of recovery and rights of set-off of any kind arising under any contract of
insurance or by operation of Law to the extent in favor of or pertaining to
the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities (other than rights in favor
of or pertaining to the Water Business or any portion thereof). In the event
that any party shall be unable to make the foregoing assignment, or if such
attempted assignment would give rise to any right of termination of, or would
otherwise adversely affect the rights of either party (or any Seller Entity
or Transferred Subsidiary) under such insurance contracts, then the parties
shall cooperate with each other and use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide each other with the benefits of all such claims, causes of action and
rights as set forth in Section 5.12. Each party shall assert claims against
or seek coverage under insurance policies owned or controlled by the other
party only in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in Section
5.12.   Section 5.12 Other Insurance Matters.   5.12.1 All Insurance
Policies sold to or procured by any of the Transferred Subsidiaries (the
"Water Business Policies") shall remain an asset of the Transferred
Subsidiaries (or otherwise be a Transferred Asset hereunder) and the
Transferred Subsidiaries shall have all rights and retain all obligations
under the Water Business Policies. Such obligations under the Water Business
Policies shall include the payment of all premiums or rating adjustments,
self-insured retentions, deductibles, or other payments owed under, and all
costs associated with (including as a result of unavailability of insurance
due to exhaustion, impairment, carrier insolvency or other event), the Water
Business Policies (collectively, the "Policy Payments"), except to the extent
that any such Policy Payments relate to the Retained Business, the Excluded
Assets or the Excluded Liabilities. The Seller shall, or shall cause one of
its Affiliates to, promptly reimburse the Purchasers or their Affiliates for
any Policy Payments, paid by the Purchasers or their Affiliates from
and after the Closing, which relate to the Retained Business, the Excluded
Assets or the Excluded Liabilities.   5.12.2 All Insurance Policies sold at
any time to the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than Insurance
Policies sold to or procured by the Transferred Subsidiaries), including all
such Insurance Policies providing for director and officer liability
insurance or fiduciary liability insurance (the "Seller Policies"), shall
remain an asset of the Seller (or otherwise be an Excluded Asset hereunder),
and the Seller shall have all rights and retain all obligations under the
Seller Policies. Such obligations under the Seller Policies shall include the
payment of Policy Payments owed under the Seller Policies, except to the
extent that any such Policy Payments relate to the Water Business (or any
portion thereof), the Transferred Assets or the Transferred Liabilities. The
Purchasers shall promptly reimburse the Seller or its Affiliates for any
Policy Payments, paid by the Seller or such Affiliates from and after the
Closing, which relate to the Water Business (or any portion thereof), the
Transferred Assets or the Transferred Liabilities.     -89-   EXECUTION
COPY  --------------   5.12.3 In the event that, after the Closing: (a) the
Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates (or any of their respective
directors, officers or employees) desire to pursue coverage under any of the
Seller Policies for claims involving the Water Business, the Transferred
Assets or the Transferred Liabilities, the Seller will use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist the Purchasers or such Affiliates in securing
coverage under the Seller Policies; and (b) the Seller or any of its
Affiliates desires to pursue coverage under any of the Water Business
Policies for claims involving the Retained Business, the Excluded Assets or
the Excluded Liabilities, the Purchasers will use commercially reasonable
efforts to assist the Seller or such Affiliates in securing coverage under
such Water Business Policies. In all cases, the party seeking insurance
coverage shall be responsible for the satisfaction of any such deductibles or
self-insured retentions as may need to be satisfied prior to obtaining such
insurance coverage, and shall otherwise be responsible for the payment of any
Policy Payments relating thereto.   5.12.4 From and after the Closing: (a)
recoveries or other payments received by the Seller or any of its Affiliates
from insurance companies to the extent related to the Water Business (or any
portion thereof), the Transferred Assets or the Transferred Liabilities shall
be paid to the Purchasers (less any amount actually expended by the Seller
and its Affiliates, other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) for the benefit
of the Water Business, the Transferred Assets or the Transferred Liabilities;
and (b) recoveries or other payments received by the Purchasers or any of
their respective Affiliates from insurance companies to the extent related to
the Retained Business, the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities shall
be paid to the Seller or its designees (less any amount actually expended by
the Transferred Subsidiaries) for the benefit of the Retained Business, the
Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities. Between the date of the signing
of this Agreement and the Closing, recoveries or other payments received by
the Seller or any of its Affiliates (less any amounts actually expended by
the Seller and its Affiliates, other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) from
insurance companies: (a) to the extent related to the loss of or damage to
any of the Transferred Assets, or (b) as reimbursement for monies paid by
Betz, any portion of the Water Business or the Transferred Subsidiaries with
respect to an insured liability, shall be treated as an asset of Betz,
the Water Business or the Transferred Subsidiaries, as appropriate. As used
in this subparagraph, the term "amounts actually expended" shall include
amounts paid (including defense fees and costs, and indemnity payments) but
not reimbursed by insurance companies and amounts spent in order to obtain
such reimbursements from insurance companies.   5.12.5 The Seller, on the
one hand, and the Purchasers, on the other hand, shall each appoint two (2)
representatives (one with responsibility for insurance and risk management
issues) to serve on an "Insurance Issues Team" which shall be charged with
negotiating in good faith any insurance related issues which may arise
between the Seller and the Purchasers, in accordance with the guidelines set
forth in this Section 5.12 and with the goals of: (a) reaching a result which
is fair and equitable to the parties taking into account all claims then
pending against each party, which claims may be insured by the Insurance
Policies at issue; (b) maximizing the recovery of insurance payments in order
to make a party which has incurred costs for a potentially covered
loss (whether for defense or indemnity) as whole as possible (provided that
each party shall remain responsible for any Policy Payments owed by that
party, including the satisfaction of any deductibles or self-insured
retentions); and (c) preserving remaining insurance coverage so that
insurance coverage remains available to cover the claims    -90-  
EXECUTION COPY  --------------  then pending against a party. Should the
Insurance Issues Team not be able to reach resolution of any such issues
within 30 days (or such longer time period as mutually agreed to in writing),
then one corporate officer of each of the Seller and the Purchasers shall
meet with the goal of resolving in good faith the issues in question. Should
the corporate officers so appointed not be able to resolve the issues in
question within 30 days of such appointment (or such longer time period as
may be mutually agreed upon in writing), then such issues shall be resolved
through a binding arbitration proceeding conducted in accordance with the
rules of the American Arbitration Association applicable to commercial
disputes. The arbitration shall take place within the City of Philadelphia
and the Laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall apply. In connection
therewith, each party shall select one arbitrator which arbitrator shall have
experience in resolving insurance disputes; the two selected arbitrators
shall then select a third arbitrator, which arbitrator shall also have
experience in resolving insurance disputes. The costs of the
arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties; provided, however, that
the arbitration panel may consider an award of costs in connection with its
resolution of any dispute.   5.12.6 For a period of not less than three (3)
years after the Closing Date, the Seller shall maintain in effect those
Seller Policies that provide directors and officers liability insurance or
fiduciary liability insurance for the benefit of persons or plans of any
portion of the Water Business or the Transferred Subsidiaries who or which,
prior to the Closing, were insureds under such policies and were covered by
the terms and conditions of those policies. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Section 5.12, the term "Policy Payments" shall not
include any premium payments paid or to be paid by the Seller with respect to
the insurance policies described in this Section 5.12.6 only.   Section
5.13 Access to Records after Closing; Commingled Items.   5.13.1 The
Purchasers recognize that, after the Closing, they may have documents, books,
records, work papers and information, whether in written, magnetic,
electronic or optical form (collectively, "Records") which relate to (a) the
Water Business with respect to the period or matters arising prior to the
Closing, including Records pertaining to the Transferred Assets,
the Transferred Liabilities and the Transferred Subsidiaries\' respective
employees, assets and liabilities (the "Water Business Records") or (b) the
Retained Business, the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities (the
"Seller\'s Records"). The Purchaser will use, and will cause its respective
Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts not to use (or take any
action to use) the Seller\'s Records and Confidential Business Information of
the Retained Business, except as provided for in this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements, and to preserve the confidentiality of any information
contained in the Seller\'s Records and Confidential Business Information of
the Retained Business (for so long as it remains non-public including after
termination or expiration of this Agreement) to keep such information
confidential, subject to any provisions of confidentiality in the Ancillary
Agreements. The Purchasers further recognize that the Seller may need access
to such Water Business Records and the Seller\'s Records after the Closing.
Upon the Seller\'s reasonable request the Purchasers shall provide the Seller
and its employees, representatives and agents access to, and the right to
photocopy (at the Seller\'s expense), during normal business hours on
reasonable advance notice, such reasonably requested Records. Subject to
Section 5.13.3, the Purchasers shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to maintain all such Records at least until the seventh anniversary of the
Closing, or, at the   -91-   EXECUTION COPY 
--------------   Purchasers\' discretion or (at any time) at the Seller\'s
reasonable request (and expense), transfer any Seller\'s Records to the
Seller.   5.13.2 The Seller recognizes that, after the Closing, it may have
Water Business Records or other Records relating to the Water Business. The
Seller will use, and will cause its respective Affiliates to use,
commercially reasonable efforts not to use (or take any action to use) Water
Business Records and Confidential Business Information of the Water Business,
except as provided for in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, and to
preserve the confidentiality of any information contained in the Water
Business Records and Confidential Business Information of the Water Business
and (for so long as it remains non-public including after termination or
expiration of this Agreement) to keep such information confidential, subject
to any provisions of confidentiality in the Ancillary Agreements. The Seller
further recognizes that the Purchasers may need access to such Water Business
Records and other Records after the Closing. Upon the Purchaser\'s reasonable
request the Seller shall provide the Purchasers and their respective
employees, representatives and agents access to, and the right to photocopy
(at the Purchasers\' expense), during normal business hours on reasonable
advance notice, such reasonably requested Records. Subject to Section 5.13.3,
the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain all such
Records at least until the seventh anniversary of the Closing, or, at the
Seller\'s discretion or (at any time) at the Purchasers\' reasonable request
(and expense), transfer any such Records to the Purchasers.   5.13.3 To the
extent that, after the Closing Date, the Purchasers will have in their
possession non-public Seller\'s Records or the Seller will have in its
possession non-public Water Business Records, in each case, that would
be impractical (notwithstanding the use of commercially reasonable efforts)
to remove, destroy or return to the other party in accordance with the
provisions of Sections 5.13.1 or 5.13.2 (collectively, the "Commingled
Items"), the Commingled Items will not be separated or segregated from the
Seller\'s or the Purchasers\' other Records, as the case may be, but, with
respect to the portion of such Commingled Items which the Seller and the
Purchasers, as the case may be, are not entitled to under the terms of this
Agreement, the Seller and the Purchasers, as the case may be, will use, and
will cause their respective Affiliates to use, their commercially reasonable
efforts not to use (or to take any action to use), and to preserve the
confidentiality of, such portion or any information contained therein, and
(for as long as it remains non-public, including after expiration or
termination of this Agreement) to keep such portion and information
confidential.   5.13.4 Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary,
Records pertaining to Taxes shall be governed solely by Section 5.9.  
5.13.5 In addition to access to Records, as set forth in Section 5.13.1 and
5.13.2, above, each of the Purchasers and the Seller recognize that each
may need access to the others\' personnel for various reasons, including for
purposes of: (a) identifying, locating and interpreting Records, and (b)
providing advice, and deposition or trial testimony in connection with
Actions or Claims, concerning (i) Records, (ii) pre-Closing business
practices, or (iii) products manufactured or sold prior to the Closing. Upon
reasonable request, the Purchasers and the Seller shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to assist
the other (including the making available to the other of personnel) with
respect to: (a) identifying, locating and interpreting Records, and (b)
providing advice, and deposition or trial    -92-   EXECUTION COPY 
--------------  testimony in connection with Actions or Claims, concerning
(i) Records, (ii) pre-Closing business practices, or (iii) products
manufactured or sold prior to the Closing; provided, however, that the party
requesting assistance shall be responsible for and shall reimburse the other
party with respect to any out of pocket costs and expenses incurred providing
such assistance, including reimbursement for employee time actually spent
providing such assistance (calculated based on that employee\'s actual time
spent times that employee\'s hourly rate of compensation as determined by
dividing that employee\'s annual salary by 2000 hours). The parties
acknowledge and agree that the rights granted under this Section 5.13.5 shall
not apply to or be available for any purpose involving a Claim or Action
between the parties or their respective Affiliates. The rights and
obligations with respect to Intellectual Property Rights under this Section
5.13.5 shall cease one (1) year from the date hereof.   5.13.6 The parties
acknowledge and agree that the obligations under this Section 5.13 shall be
subject to any Laws or legal obligations which prohibit the sharing of the
information requested by a party.   Section 5.14 Loan Documents;
Intercompany Accounts; Guaranties.   5.14.1 The Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain at or before the Closing (a) the
written release and waiver from all appropriate Persons of (i) any and all
Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances) imposed on any portion of
the Water Business, the Transferred Assets or the assets of the Transferred
Subsidiaries (including upon the Betz Common Stock and the Water Subsidiaries
Stock pursuant to the Loan Documents or otherwise), (ii) any and all
guaranties granted by the Transferred Subsidiaries pursuant to the Loan
Documents and (iii) any and all guaranties granted by any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries in respect of any other Indebtedness or other obligations of the
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries),
and (b) the delivery to the Seller of the certificates representing the
shares of Betz Common Stock and Water Subsidiaries Stock.   5.14.2 Subject
to the procedures and exceptions set forth in Section 5.14.2 of the Seller\'s
Disclosure Schedule, at or prior to the Closing, all intercompany receivables
or payables and loans then existing between the Seller and its Affiliates
(other than the Transferred Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the
Transferred Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be settled in the Ordinary
Course of Business or, in the Seller\'s discretion, by way of
capital contribution, dividend or otherwise.   5.14.3 The Purchasers shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause themselves or one or more
of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to be substituted in all
respects for the Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred
Subsidiaries), effective as of the Closing, in respect of all obligations of
the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred
Subsidiaries) under each of the guaranties, letters of credit and letters of
comfort, set forth in Section 5.14.3 of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule,
obtained by the Seller or such Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred
Subsidiaries) for the benefit of the Transferred Subsidiaries
(the "Guaranties"). If the Purchasers are unable to effect such a
substitution with respect to any Guaranty after using their commercially
reasonable efforts to do so, and the Seller has made a written request to the
Purchasers to pay on its behalf amounts due under a non-transferred Guaranty,
the Purchaser shall pay such amounts when requested. In the event the   
-93-   EXECUTION COPY  --------------  Purchaser fails to pay such
amount, and in any event does not pay such amounts by the later of (x) two
days after written request by the Seller and (y) the date such written notice
indicates that such amount is due to an applicable third party (the "Interest
Accrual Date"), the Purchasers shall pay interest on such amount at a 12%
annual rate from the Interest Accrual Date to the date of payment. As a
result of the substitution contemplated by the first sentence of this Section
5.14.3 and/or the payment obligation contemplated by the second sentence of
this Section 5.14.3, and subject to the provisions of Section 8.2.2(c), the
Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall,
from and after the Closing, cease to have any obligations whatsoever arising
from or in connection with the Guaranties, except for obligations, if any,
for which the Seller or its Affiliates will be fully indemnified pursuant to
the second sentence of this Section 5.14.3 or Section 8.2.2(c).   Section
5.15 Inventory Count.   5.15.1 The Seller shall take a count of the
Inventories of the Seller or any of its Affiliates relating to the Water
Business (other than Inventories of the Seller or any of its Affiliates
relating to the Water Business located at the sites of Customers (as defined
in the Distribution Agreement)) as of the Accounting Closing Date (the
"Accounting Closing Inventory Count"). If the Purchaser so elects, the
Purchasers and the Purchasers\' accountants may participate in the Accounting
Closing Inventory Count. Such Accounting Closing Inventory Count shall be
taken in accordance with the Seller\'s historical inventory taking
procedures, which procedures have previously been disclosed in writing to the
Purchasers. The Seller and the Purchasers hereby agree that the Accounting
Closing Inventory Count shall be used in determining the Closing Date Net

pertains to the Water Business or any portion thereof, to the Acquiring
Person (from and after the date of entering into the agreement to acquire the
Competing Business)), or (c) activities conducted pursuant to and according
to the terms of the Ancillary Agreements, shall not constitute a violation of
this Section 5.20.1.   5.20.2 The parties agree that the prohibitions in
this Section 5.20 are in addition to, and not in lieu of, and shall not
constitute a wavier of, any rights or remedies which the Purchasers or the
Seller, as the case may be, have or may have pursuant to (i) the Ancillary
Agreements, (ii) the Confidentiality Agreement, or (iii) the Seller\'s or the
Purchasers\' rights in any jurisdiction under any applicable Law, whether
statutory or otherwise, whether in law or in equity.   Section 5.21
Reorganization. (a) Prior to the Closing, or to the extent applicable
pursuant to Section 2.4.2, such other date, the Seller shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, at the Seller\'s sole cost and expense (provided, however,
that nothing herein shall require the Seller to take any actions or incur any
costs or expenses which it is not required to take or incur under Section 5.5
and 5.6 in order to effect any step of the Reorganization) effect the
Reorganization in the manner set forth in Section 5.21A of the Seller\'s
Disclosure Schedule (including the alternatives described therein) or as
otherwise permitted pursuant to clauses (b) and (c) of this Section 5.21.  
(b) In the event, prior to or on the Closing, the Seller desires to change
the manner in which a subsidiary, asset, liability, right, obligation or
interest (including equity interest) is to be transferred among the Seller\'s
Affiliates (e.g., the use of an asset transfer rather than a stock sale)
(such change, a "Structural Change") from the corresponding step set forth in
Section 5.21A of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule (other than pursuant to
a decision of the Seller in its sole discretion to use an alternative
step specified in Section 5.21A of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule), then
the Seller must either (1) obtain the consent of the Purchaser following
written notice from the Seller setting forth in reasonable detail the
proposed Structural Change(s), the reason(s) therefore and all information
reasonably necessary for the Purchaser to make the determinations described
in clauses (a) and (b) below, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
(it being understood and agreed, without limitation, that the Purchaser may
withhold its consent if a duly authorized representative of the Purchaser
notifies the Seller within 5 Business Days after receipt of such notice that
the proposed Structural Change (a) would impede or delay in any material way
the ability of the parties to close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or (b) would directly or indirectly
prejudice or increase the costs (including Tax costs) to the Purchaser, and
provides the Seller with an accounting in reasonable detail of its good faith
reasonable estimate of the Damages (net of benefits) the Purchaser would
suffer, if any, if the proposed change were consented to); or (2) in the
event the Purchaser withholds its consent pursuant to clause (b) above,
effect the Structural     -97-   EXECUTION COPY 
--------------  Change and reimburse the Purchaser on an after Tax basis for
the estimated amount of such accounting (it being understood (1) that payment
of such amount shall not bar a recovery by the Seller (and such recovery
shall be permitted) to the extent the actual Damages (net of benefits)
suffered by the Purchaser as a result of such change was lower than the
amount paid by the Seller hereunder; in which case the Seller shall be
permitted to recover such difference plus all reasonable costs and expense of
recovery (including attorney\'s and accountants fees), and (2) that payment
of such amount shall not bar a recovery by the Purchaser (and such recovery
shall be permitted) to the extent the actual Damages (net of benefits)
suffered by the Purchaser as a result of such change was greater than the
amount paid by the Seller hereunder). For the avoidance of doubt, a
"Structural Change" does not include, among other things, a change
with respect to the assignment of a Contract, Purchased Intellectual
Property, Retained Business Contracts or Retained Business Intellectual
Property Rights, which can be accomplished in the manner set forth in Section
5.5.1.   (c) The Seller and the Purchasers agree and acknowledge that
no consent shall be required to make changes other than Structural Changes.
The parties also agree that after the Closing with respect to the parts of
the Reorganization that could not be completed because of Transfer Approvals
and are subject to Section 2.4.2, no Structural Change(s) may be made to
the Reorganization without the consent described in Section 5.21(b), except
if otherwise required by Section 2.4.2(b).   (d) Each of the Seller and the
Purchaser agrees that it will, and will cause its respective Affiliates to,
comply with all reasonable requests from the other for information that is
necessary to calculate and/or verify Damages (as described above in (b)),
whether such request is made before, on or after the Closing.   (e) It is
agreed and understood that Section 5.21B of the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule
("Part B") does not constitute a part of the Reorganization. Part B may be
amended prior to or on the Closing, in the same manner and subject to the
same limitations as set forth in Section 5.21(b) and after the Closing in the
manner described in Section 5.21(c). It is also agreed and understood that
any change in the manner in which the Reorganization or Part B is carried out
which is permitted pursuant to this Section 5.21 shall be deemed to be a part
of the Reorganization or Part B, as the case may be, as if it was described
on the relevant part of Section 5.21 of the Seller\'s
Disclosure Schedule.   Section 5.22 No Solicitation. From the date hereof
until the Closing Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement, other
than in the Ordinary Course of Business, the Seller shall not, nor shall it
authorize or permit any of the Purchased Subsidiaries to solicit the
submission of any offers or proposals for the Water Business or any portion
thereof, the Purchased Subsidiaries and their respective Subsidiaries, the
Transferred Assets or the Transferred Liabilities from any third party or
otherwise directly or knowingly indirectly pursue any offer or proposal so
received; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 5.22 shall apply to
the solicitation or pursuit of any offers or proposals of a third party
regarding the acquisition of the Seller or any of the Seller\'s
other assets.   Section 5.23 Leaseback Leases. The Seller and the Purchaser
agree that at or prior to the Closing, (i) the Seller shall cause the
transfer of title to the Leaseback Properties from Betz to    -98-  
EXECUTION COPY  --------------  the Seller or its Affiliates, and (ii) the
Seller, or its Affiliates, and Betz will enter into the Leaseback Leases, in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit VIII, demising the Leaseback Properties
back to Betz in accordance with the terms of such Leaseback Leases. The
Seller and the Purchaser further agree that if the Seller shall sell or cause
the sale of any Leaseback Property to any third party prior to the Closing,
then such sale shall be subject to the terms of the applicable Leaseback
Lease.   Section 5.24 Escheat. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Seller shall have no liability in connection with, and
the Purchasers shall be responsible for and shall hold the Seller and any
successor entities thereto or Affiliates thereof harmless against, any claims
made on or after the Closing Date for or with respect to abandoned, unclaimed
or escheatable property, whether or not such claims arise from events or
activities taken prior to, on or after the Closing Date, to the extent such
claims relate or are attributable to the Transferred Subsidiaries.  
Section 5.25 [Reserved].   Section 5.26 Other Agreement. The Seller and the
Purchasers agree that as soon as possible after the date hereof, the Seller
and the Purchasers shall negotiate in good faith to and enter into an
agreement for the purposes and with the terms set forth in Section 5.26 of
the Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule.   Section 5.27 Certain Water Business
Properties. The Seller and the Purchaser agree that, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, prior to the Closing, or to the extent applicable
pursuant to Section 2.4.2, the date of the Deferred Transfer, the Seller will
take such steps as are necessary to cause the removal and transfer from the
Transferred Subsidiaries of any Owned Real Properties that are listed as
Excluded Assets on Schedule 3.20, so that after Closing (and the date of the
Deferred Transfer, as applicable) those assets shall be owned by the Seller
(or its Affiliates).   ARTICLE VI   CONDITIONS TO CLOSING   Section 6.1

the Seller and its Representatives, against and in respect of any and all
Damages arising out of, resulting from or incurred in connection with (a) any
breach of representations and warranties which survives the Closing under
Section 8.1 in each case as of the Closing Date (provided that with respect
to representations and warranties made as of a specified date, any breach as

pursuant to the provisions of this Section 8.2 is referred to herein as an

until the aggregate amount of all Claims under Section 8.2.1(a) and the Deeds
totals $20,000,000 (the "Basket Amount"), in which event the Seller\'s
indemnification obligation contained in Section 8.2.1(a) and the Deeds shall
apply to the total amount of Damages in excess of the Basket Amount, subject
to a maximum liability to the Purchasers, in the aggregate, of $100,000,000
(the "Cap Amount") for all Claims under Section 8.2.1(a), and the Deeds, in

Section 8.2.2(a) in the aggregate.   8.2.6 Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(a) no party hereto shall be obligated to provide indemnification with
respect to any individual claim that could be made under Section 8.2.1(a),
8.2.2(a) or 5.9.1(a) (but only to the extent such claim relates to the Water
Business) or 5.9.1(e), or under any Deed, for Damages if the entire amount of
Damages relating to such claim is, or is reasonably expected to be, less than

extent such claim relates to the Water Business) or 5.9.1(e)), and (b) no
party hereto shall be obligated to provide indemnification under Section
8.2.1(a) or 8.2.2(a), or under any Deed, unless it is notified of the claim
for Damages prior to the expiration of the Survival Period applicable to such

Tax matters, the provisions of this Article VIII shall constitute the sole
and exclusive remedy of any Indemnified    -104-   EXECUTION COPY 
--------------   Party for Damages arising out of, resulting from or
incurred in connection with any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty
or the breach of any representation or warranty made by the Purchasers or the
Seller in this Agreement; provided, however, this exclusive remedy for
Damages does not preclude a party from bringing an action for specific
performance or other equitable remedy to require a party to perform its
agreements, covenants or obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement or for fraud or willful misconduct.   8.2.8 The Seller shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Purchasers and any other Indemnified Party of
the Purchasers from and against any and all Damages incurred or suffered by
such Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting from, or relating to the
Seller\'s failure to comply with the terms and conditions of any applicable
bulk sales or bulk transfer or similar Laws of any jurisdiction that may be
applicable to the sale or transfer of any or all of the Transferred Assets to
the Purchasers (or its Designated Affiliates), notwithstanding the waiver
contained in the following sentence. In consideration of the Seller\'s
agreement to indemnify the Purchasers and other Indemnified Parties of the
Purchasers pursuant to this Section 8.2.8, the Purchasers hereby waives
compliance by the Seller and the Selling Entities with the requirements and
provisions of any bulk sales or bulk transfer or similar Laws of
any jurisdiction, including Article 6 of the New York Commercial Code, that
may otherwise be applicable with respect to the sale or transfer of any or
all of the Transferred Assets to the Purchasers.   8.2.9 The Seller shall
pay, and shall indemnify the Purchasers in respect of, any and all investment
banking fees, brokers\' or finders\' fees, or any other commission or similar
fee, payable to any Person acting on behalf of the Seller or any of its
Affiliates or under the authority of any them, in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated herein (including as a result of the occurrence of
the Closing), and the Purchasers shall pay, and shall jointly and severally
indemnify the Seller in respect of, any and all investment banking fees,
brokers\' or finders\' fees, or any other commission or similar fee, payable
to any person acting on behalf of the Purchasers or any of their Affiliates
or under the authority of any of them, in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated herein, in each case regardless of whether
any claim for payment is asserted before or after the Closing of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or before or after any termination of this
Agreement.   Section 8.3 Procedures for Third Party Claims.   8.3.1 In the
case of any claim for indemnification arising from a Claim of a third party
(a "Third Party Claim"), an Indemnified Party shall give prompt written
notice to the Indemnifying Party of any Claim of which such Indemnified Party
has knowledge, and as to which it may request indemnification hereunder,
specifying (to the extent known) the amount of such Claim and any relevant
facts and circumstances relating thereto; provided, however, that any failure
to give such prompt notice or to provide any such facts and circumstances
will not waive any rights of the Indemnified Party, except to the extent that
the rights of the Indemnifying Party are actually prejudiced thereby. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right (and, if it elects to exercise such
right, to do so by written notice within 30 days after receiving notice from
the Indemnified Party) to defend and to direct the defense against any such
Third Party Claim, in its name or in the name of the Indemnified Party, as
the case may be, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, and with
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party, unless (a) the    
-105-     EXECUTION COPY  --------------  Indemnifying Party shall not
have taken any action to defend such Third Party Claim within such 30-day
period, or (b) the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that
there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party in the conduct of the defense of such Third Party Claim.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (other than the
last sentence of this Section 8.3.1), the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with each other and keep the other party
fully informed in the defense of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified
Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any Third Party
Claim with counsel employed at its own expense; provided, however, that, in
the case of any Third Party Claim described in clause (b) above or as to
which the Indemnifying Party shall not in fact have employed counsel
to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within such 30-day period,
the reasonable fees and disbursements of such Indemnified Party\'s counsel
shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall have no indemnification obligations with respect to any Third Party
Claim which shall be settled by the Indemnified Party without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.   8.3.2 The Indemnifying Party, if it has assumed the
defense of any Third Party Claim as provided in this Section 8.3, shall not
consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any
such Third Party Claim without the Indemnified Party\'s prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) unless such settlement or
judgment (a) relates solely to monetary damages for which the Indemnifying
Party shall be responsible and (b) includes as an unconditional term thereof
the release of the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect to such
Third Party Claim.   8.3.3 The foregoing provisions of this Section 8.3
shall not apply to Third Party Claims involving Taxes, which Claims shall
instead be governed by the provisions of Section 5.9.   Section 8.4
Procedures for Inter-Party Claims. In the event that an Indemnified Party
determines that it has a Claim for Damages against an Indemnifying Party
hereunder (other than as a result of a Third Party Claim), the Indemnified
Party shall give prompt written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party,
specifying the amount of such Claim and any relevant facts and circumstances
relating thereto. The Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party
with reasonable access to its Records for the purpose of allowing the
Indemnifying Party a reasonable opportunity to verify any such claim for
Damages. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall negotiate in
good faith for a 30-day period regarding the resolution of any disputed
claims for Damages. If no resolution is reached with regard to such disputed
Claim between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party within such
30-day period, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to seek
appropriate remedies in accordance with the terms hereof. Promptly following
the final determination of the amount of any Damages claimed by the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall pay such Damages to the
Indemnified Party by wire transfer or check made payable to the order of the
Indemnified Party. In the event that the Indemnified Party is required to
institute an Action in order to recover Damages hereunder, the reasonable and
verifiable cost of such Action shall be added to the amount of Damages
payable to the Indemnified Party if the Indemnified Party recovers at least
50% of the Damages sought in such proceedings. In the event that a party
hereto claiming to be an Indemnified Party institutes an    -106-  
EXECUTION COPY  --------------  Action in order to recover Damages
hereunder and the applicable court refuses to award any Damages to such
party, such party shall reimburse the defending party for the cost of such
Action.   Section 8.5 Calculation of Damages. The Damages suffered by any
party hereto shall be calculated after giving effect to the receipt by the
Indemnified Party of any available insurance proceeds or recoveries from
third parties. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, to avoid
double-counting as to any matter, the term "Damages" shall not include any
liability to the extent that such liability (or a reserve therefor (to the
extent of such reserve)) is reflected as a liability in the Consolidated
Statement of Net Assets or the Final Closing Date Statement of Net Assets
even if any such liability would also constitute a breach of any of the
Seller\'s representations or warranties hereunder; provided, that in the case
of liabilities (or reserves therefor) reflected on the Final Closing Date
Statement of Net Assets (but not the Consolidated Statement of Net Assets),
the term "Damages" shall not include such liabilities or reserves only to the
extent such liabilities (or reserves) result in Decreased Consideration.

attempt to make such a designation shall be considered in determining whether
such designation is made in compliance with clauses (2) and (3) of the
definition of "Designated Affiliate." The Purchasers acknowledge and agree
that any representation, warranty or covenant of the Seller which is breached
or is not true and correct, shall be deemed true and correct and not breached
to the extent such breach or inaccuracy resulted solely from the designation
of a Designated Affiliate.   [THIS SPACE INTENTIONALLY LEFT
