 1.2 _Effective Time; Closing_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the "Certificate of Merger") (the time of such filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or such later time as may be agreed in writing by the Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the "Effective Time") as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date.

 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, at the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such Certificate of Incorporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time, Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Storage Technology Corporation" and the Certificate of Incorporation shall be amended so as to comply with Section 5.11(a).

 (a) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of the Common Stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(d), will be canceled and extinguished and automatically converted (subject to Section 1.7) into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to $37.00, without interest (such amount of cash hereinafter referred to as the "Merger Consideration") upon surrender of the certificate representing such share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.8 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner provided in Section 1.10).    

 (b) _Repurchase Rights_. If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company ("Company Unvested Common Stock"), then, the amounts payable with respect to such shares of Company Unvested Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.6(a) shall be withheld and retained by Parent and shall be subject to permanent retention by Parent (i.e., forfeiture by the former holder of such shares of Company Unvested Common Stock) on the same terms that governed such Company Unvested Common Stock prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall hold the cash so withheld until such cash is no longer subject to permanent retention by Parent, at which time such withheld cash will be paid to the former holders of the applicable Company Unvested Common Stock on a monthly basis as reasonably determined by Parent.    

 (c) _Non-Employee Options_. At the Effective Time, each Company Option held by any person other than an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each such Company Option, a "Non-Employee Option") that is unexpired, unsettled, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, terminate in its entirety at the Effective Time. Non-Employee Options granted under the Companys Amended and Restated 1995 Equity Participation Plan shall terminate or be      ##### 

  

     

EXECUTION COPY    

settled, as applicable, in accordance with their terms, after the notice
period required under such plan, provided such notice period shall expire on
the Effective Time, and shall so terminate regardless of whether such Non-
Employee Options have been either exercised or unexercised during such
notice period (giving effect to any acceleration of vesting resulting from
the Merger or non-assumption by Parent). Non-Employee Options granted under
the 2004 Long Term Incentive Plan shall terminate or be settled, as
applicable, in accordance with their terms, and the holder of each such Non-
Employee Option shall be entitled to receive therefor an amount of cash
(rounded down to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock as to which such Company Option was
vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time (giving effect
to any acceleration of vesting resulting from the Merger or non-assumption by
Parent), and (ii) the excess, if any, of the per share Merger Consideration
over the exercise price, if any, of such Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each such payment, a "Cancellation Payment"). Non-
Employee Options granted under the Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan
for Nonemployee Directors, shall be terminated after such holder has been
provided notice by the Company of such termination, and has agreed to such
cancellation in exchange for a Cancellation Payment. Any materials,
notifications or consents which are to be submitted to the holders of Non-
Employee Options pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to review and
approval by Parent.    

 (d) _Cancellation of Treasury and Parent Owned Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company or Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.    

 (e) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, no par value, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no par value, of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.    

 (f) _Employee Stock Options; Employee Stock Purchase Plans_. At the Effective Time, all Company Options, other than Non-Employee Options, outstanding under each Company Stock Option Plan shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 5.9. Rights outstanding under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan and any other employee stock purchase plan of the Company (collectively, the "Company Purchase Plans") shall be treated as set forth in Section 5.9(c).    

 (g) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.     #####

 1.7 _Dissenting Shares_.   

 (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has not effectively withdrawn or lost such holders appraisal rights under Section 262 of Delaware Law (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the applicable consideration for Company Common Stock set forth in Section 1.6, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are provided by Delaware Law.    

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.7(a), if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holders shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the consideration for Company Common Stock, as applicable, set forth in Section 1.6, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares.    

 (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand for appraisal received by the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in any negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any such demands or offer to settle or settle any such demands. Any communication to be made by the Company to any holder of Company Common Stock with respect to such demands shall be submitted to Parent in advance and shall not be presented to any holder of Company Common Stock prior to the Company receiving Parents consent.    

 1.8 _Surrender of Certificates_.   

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Parent shall select an institution reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the Merger.    

 (b) _Parent to Provide Cash_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article I, the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.6(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. Any cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund."    

 (c) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(a): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for cash constituting the Merger      ##### 

  

     

EXECUTION COPY    

Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of record of such
Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the cash
constituting the Merger Consideration, and the Certificates so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates
will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes,
to evidence the ownership of the Merger Consideration into which such shares
of Company Common Stock shall have been so converted.    

 (d) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Exchange Agent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or Company Options such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, the amount of such consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid.    

 (e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.8, neither the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.    

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis; _provided_ that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to Company stockholders pursuant to this Article I. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to Company stockholders pursuant to this Article I shall promptly be paid to Parent.    

 (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates nine months after the Effective Time shall, at the request of the Surviving Corporation, be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or otherwise according to the instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of the Certificates who have not surrendered such Certificates in compliance with this Section 1.8 shall after such delivery to the Surviving Corporation, subject to Section 1.8(e), look only to the Surviving Corporation solely as general creditors for the cash constituting the Merger Consideration (which shall not accrue interest) pursuant to Section 1.6(a) with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.    

 1.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights    #####

pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation
of shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article I.    

 1.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such cash constituting the Merger Consideration; provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Company or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   

 1.11 _Further Action_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

EXECUTION COPY    

Requirement is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use all reasonable efforts
to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such Legal Requirement on the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.    

 (e) _Limitation on Divestiture_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to agree to any Action of Divestiture that would be reasonably likely to materially impact Parent and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, take or agree to take any Action of Divestiture that would be reasonably likely to materially impact Parent and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. For purposes of this Agreement, an "Action of Divestiture" shall mean (i) any license, sale or other disposition or holding separate (through establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or properties of Parent, its subsidiaries or affiliates, or of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) the imposition of any limitation on the ability of Parent, its subsidiaries or affiliates, or the Company or its Subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses or own any capital stock or assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of their respective businesses and, in the case of Parent, the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or (iii) the imposition of any impediment on Parent, its subsidiaries or affiliates, or the Company or its Subsidiaries under any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, order or other legal restraint governing competition, monopolies or restrictive trade practices.    

 5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_.   

 (a) _By the Company_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub of any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) would not be satisfied.    

 (b) _By Parent_. Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company of any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of Parent to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) would not be satisfied.    

 5.8 _Third-Party Consents_. As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company will use all reasonable efforts to seek such material consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or its Subsidiaries respective Contracts required to be obtained in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby as may be reasonably requested by Parent after consultation with the Company, including all consents, waivers and approvals set forth in Section 2.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter. In connection with seeking such consents, waivers and approvals, the Company shall keep Parent informed of all material developments and,    ##### 

  

  

EXECUTION COPY    

shall at Parents request, include Parent in any discussions or
communications with any parties whose consent, waiver or approval is sought
hereunder. Such consents, waivers and approvals shall be in a form acceptable
to Parent. In the event the Merger does not close for any reason, Parent
shall not have any liability to the Company, its stockholders or any other
Person for any costs, claims, liabilities or damages resulting from the
Company seeking to obtain such consents, waivers and approvals. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Companys failure to obtain any consent set forth
in Section 2.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter or which is otherwise
reasonably requested to be obtained by Parent pursuant to this Section 5.8,
in each case, provided that the Company has used all reasonable efforts to
seek such consent, shall not give rise to a failure to satisfy the condition
to closing set forth in Section 6.2(b).    

 5.9 _Equity Awards and Employee Matters_.   

 (a) _Assumption of Employee Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company Option other than Non-Employee Options, whether or not exercisable at the Effective Time and regardless of the respective exercise prices thereof, will be assumed by Parent. Each Company Option other than Non-Employee Options so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Company Option (including any applicable stock option agreement or other document evidencing such Company Option) immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any repurchase rights or vesting provisions), except that (i) each such Company Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the ratio of the value of the per share Merger Consideration to the average of the closing prices for a share of Parent Common Stock on the ten trading days ended one trading day prior to the Closing Date (such ratio, the "Option Ratio"), rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each assumed Company Option shall be vested immediately following the Effective Time as to the same percentage of the total number of shares subject thereto as it was vested as to immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent such Company Option by its terms as of the Effective Time provides for acceleration of vesting upon the Effective Time. As soon as reasonably practicable, Parent will use all reasonable efforts to issue to each Person who holds an assumed Company Option a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Company Option by Parent and, as a condition to such assumption, each former holder of a Company Option so assumed by Parent shall acknowledge the receipt of the same in exchange for such holders Company Option.    

 (b) _Incentive Stock Options_. The conversion of Company Options provided for in Section 5.9(a), with respect to any options which are intended to be "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be effected in a manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.     ##### 

  

     

EXECUTION COPY    

 (c) _Termination of Company Employee Stock Purchase Plans_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company Purchase Plans shall be terminated. The rights of participants in each Company Purchase Plan with respect to any offering period then underway under such Company Purchase Plan shall be determined by treating the last Business Day prior to, or if more administratively advisable, the last payroll date of the Company immediately prior to, the Effective Time, as the last day of such offering period and by making such other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period but otherwise treating such shortened offering period as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under such Company Purchase Plan. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms of such the Company Purchase Plan) that are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 5.9(c).    

 (d) _Termination of 401(k) Plans_. Effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, each of the Company, its Subsidiaries and any ERISA Affiliate shall terminate any and all Company Employee Plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement, including specifically the Company Subsidiary 401(k) plan for its employees in Puerto Rico (unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that any such 401(k) plan shall not be terminated). Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company Employee Plan(s) have been terminated (effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company, its Subsidiaries or such ERISA Affiliate, as the case may be. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be provided by Parent. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company Employee Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably require.    

 5.10 _Form S-8_. Parent agrees to file a registration statement on Form S-8 for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to assumed Company Options to the extent Form S-8 is available within 60 days after the Effective Time.   

 5.11 _Indemnification_.   

 (a) _Indemnity_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to the indemnification provisions of the Surviving Corporations Bylaws as in effect as of the date hereof and any indemnification agreements between the Company and its directors and officers in effect as of the date hereof (including, to the extent indemnifiable thereunder, for acts or omissions occuring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) (the "Indemnified Parties"). The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (or any successor to the Surviving Corporation) will contain provisions with respect to exculpation, indemnification and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not, except as required by law, be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of Indemnified Parties unless the Surviving Corporation (or any successor to the Surviving Corporation) provides other assurance sufficient to ensure the      ##### 

  

     

EXECUTION COPY    

continued exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses of the
Indemnified Parties as provided in such Bylaws prior to any such amendment,
repeal or modification.    

 (b) _Insurance_. For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain directors and officers liability insurance with one or more reputable unaffiliated third-party insurers maintained by the Company covering those persons who are covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy as of the date hereof for events occurring prior to the Effective Time on terms and conditions that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to the insured than those applicable to the current directors and officers of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one year in excess of 250% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage (and to the extent annual premium would exceed 250% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage, the Surviving Corporation shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be maintained the maximum amount of coverage as is available for such 250% of such annual premium) and _provided further_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may satisfy its obligations under this Section 5.11(b) by purchasing a "tail" policy under the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policy which (i) has an effective term of six years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers those persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof for actions and omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) contains terms and conditions that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to the insured than those of the Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof.    

 (c) _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Section 5.11 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent and the Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and assigns. In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or its successor or assign (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successor and assign of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honor the obligations set forth with respect to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, in this Section 5.11.    

 5.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under applicable law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by Article I of this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.   

 5.13 _Insurance Approval_. The Company shall deliver to Parent at least 15 days prior to the Closing a letter in a form acceptable to Parent validly executed by an officer of the Company, which authorizes Parents insurance broker, effective as of the Closing Date, to act as the Companys insurance broker of record with respect to all insurance policies held by the Company.    #####

For purposes of this Agreement, the words "include," "includes" and "including," when used herein, shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 (c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect," when used in connection with an entity, means any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or effect (any such item, an "Effect"), individually or when taken together with all other Effects that have occurred prior to the date of determination of the occurrence of the Material Adverse Effect, that is or is reasonably likely to (i) be materially adverse to the business, assets (including intangible assets), liabilities, capitalization, financial condition or results of operations of such entity taken as a whole with its Subsidiaries, other than any Effect (A) primarily resulting from changes affecting the United States or world economy generally which changes do not disproportionately affect such entity taken as a whole with its Subsidiaries, (B) primarily resulting from changes affecting the industry in which such entity and its Subsidiaries operate generally which changes do not disproportionately affect such entity taken as a whole with its Subsidiaries, (C) primarily resulting      #####

from a change in such entitys stock price or the trading volume in such
stock; _provided_ that this clause (C) shall not exclude any underlying
Effect which may have caused such change in stock price or trading volume,
(D) primarily resulting from acts of terrorism or war which changes do not
disproportionately affect such entity taken as a whole with its Subsidiaries,

clause (F) shall not exclude the revenues or earnings of the Company
themselves or any Effect which may have affected the Companys revenues or
earnings; or (ii) materially impede the authority of such entity, or, in any
case, Parent, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in accordance with the terms hereof and applicable Legal Requirements.

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.   

 8.5 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Voting Agreements and other Exhibits hereto (i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, it being understood that the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except as specifically provided, following the Effective Time, in Section 5.11.   

 8.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.   

 8.7 _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other    ##### 

  

  

EXECUTION COPY    

remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise
by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.    

 8.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and such process.   

 8.9 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.   

 8.10 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other parties, except that Parent may assign its rights and delegate its obligations hereunder to its affiliates as long as Parent remains ultimately liable for all of Parents obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment in violation of this Section 8.10 shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.   

 8.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
