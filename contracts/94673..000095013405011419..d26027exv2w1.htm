the Company or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company, the following shall
occur:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <B><I>Company Common Stock</I></B>. Each share of the Common Stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the
Company (&#147;<B>Company Common Stock</B>&#148;) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to <B>Section&nbsp;1.6(d)</B>, will be
canceled and extinguished and automatically converted (subject to <B>Section&nbsp;1.7</B>) into the right to

referred to as the &#147;<B>Merger Consideration</B>&#148;) upon surrender of the certificate representing such
share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in <B>Section&nbsp;1.8 </B>(or in the case of a lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the
manner provided in <B>Section&nbsp;1.10</B>).



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <B><I>Repurchase Rights</I></B>. If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with the
Company (&#147;<B>Company Unvested Common Stock</B>&#148;), then, the amounts payable with respect to such shares of

retained by Parent and shall be subject to permanent retention by Parent (i.e., forfeiture by the
former holder of such shares of Company Unvested Common Stock) on the same terms that governed such
Company Unvested Common Stock prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall hold the cash so withheld
until such cash is no longer subject to permanent
retention by Parent, at which time such withheld cash will be paid to the former holders of
the applicable Company Unvested Common Stock on a monthly basis as reasonably determined by Parent.

applicable, in accordance with their terms, after the notice period required under such plan,
provided such notice period shall expire on the Effective Time, and shall so terminate regardless
of whether such Non-Employee Options have been either exercised or unexercised during such notice
period (giving effect to any acceleration of vesting resulting from the Merger or non-assumption by
Parent). Non-Employee Options granted under the 2004 Long Term Incentive Plan shall terminate or
be settled, as applicable, in accordance with their terms, and the holder of each such Non-Employee
Option shall be entitled to receive therefor an amount of cash (rounded down to the nearest whole
cent) equal to the product of (i)&nbsp;the number of shares of Company Common Stock as to which such
Company Option was vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time (giving effect to
any acceleration of vesting resulting from the Merger or non-assumption by Parent), and (ii)&nbsp;the
excess, if any, of the per share Merger Consideration over the exercise price, if any, of such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (each such payment, a &#147;<B>Cancellation
Payment</B>&#148;). Non-Employee Options granted under the Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan for
Nonemployee Directors, shall be terminated after such holder has been provided notice by the
Company of such termination, and has agreed to such cancellation in exchange for a Cancellation
Payment. Any materials, notifications or consents which are to be submitted to the holders of
Non-Employee Options pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to review and approval by Parent.

by the Company or Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or of
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) <B><I>Capital Stock of Merger Sub</I></B>. Each share of common stock, no par value, of Merger Sub (the
&#147;<B>Merger Sub Common Stock</B>&#148;) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no par
value, of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub
Common Stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) <B><I>Employee Stock Options; Employee Stock Purchase Plans</I></B>. At the Effective Time, all Company
Options, other than Non-Employee Options, outstanding under each Company Stock Option Plan shall be
assumed by Parent in accordance with <B>Section&nbsp;5.9</B>. Rights outstanding under the Company&#146;s Employee
Stock Purchase Plan and any other employee stock purchase plan of
the Company (collectively, the &#147;<B>Company Purchase Plans</B>&#148;) shall be treated as set forth in
<B>Section&nbsp;5.9(c)</B>.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) <B><I>Adjustments to Merger Consideration</I></B>. The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to
reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to Company
Common Stock having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

opportunity to participate in any negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The

written offer made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, pursuant

Directors of the Company has in good faith concluded (following consultation with its outside legal

event that the provisions of this <B>Section&nbsp;5.3 </B>were not performed in accordance with their specific
terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed by the parties hereto that Parent shall
be entitled to an immediate injunction or injunctions, without the necessity of proving the
inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or other
security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of this <B>Section&nbsp;5.3 </B>and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which Parent may be entitled at law or in equity.

all other information concerning the business, properties and personnel (subject to restrictions

and (iii)&nbsp;all Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as reasonably requested by Parent. The
Company agrees to promptly provide to Parent and its accountants,

efforts to establish a process that, through use of steps such as targeted redactions, provision of
information to counsel to review and summarize for Parent or use of a &#145;clean room&#146; environment for

applicable law and its confidentiality obligations to third parties or preserve the Company&#146;s
attorney-client privilege, as the case may be. In addition, the Company will, in consultation with
Parent, prepare and implement a plan designed to ensure timely compliance by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with the requirements of the Restrictions on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances
in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (2002/95/EC) Directive.

except that (i)&nbsp;each such Company Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in
accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the ratio of the value of the
per share Merger Consideration to the average of the closing prices for a share of Parent Common
Stock on the ten trading days ended one trading day prior to the Closing Date (such ratio, the
&#147;<B>Option Ratio</B>&#148;), rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii)
the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
assumed Company Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per
