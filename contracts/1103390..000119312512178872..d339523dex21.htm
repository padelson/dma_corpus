iii  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (" _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into
as of April 21, 2012 (the " _Agreement Date_ ") by and among Zeneca Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), QAM Corp., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Ardea BioSciences,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain capitalized terms
used in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.

RECITALS

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") in accordance with
this Agreement and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ").
Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the
Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent;

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved this Agreement and the Merger and deem it advisable and
in the best interest of the stockholders of each of the constituent
corporations to consummate the Merger; and

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parents and Merger Subs
willingness to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Merger,
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement certain
stockholders of the Company are executing voting agreements (collectively, the
" _Voting Agreements_ ") in favor of Parent whereby they have agreed to vote
their shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement.

AGREEMENT

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

ARTICLE I.

DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION

 

1.1 Merger of Merger Sub into the Company. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease. The Company will continue as the surviving corporation
in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). 

1.2 Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

1.3 Closing; Effective Time. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_
") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on or prior to the second
(2nd) Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be
satisfied  or waived of the conditions set forth in Article V (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or such other date as
Parent and the Company shall mutually designate. The Closing shall take place
at the offices of Paul Hastings LLP located at 4747 Executive Drive, 12th
Floor, San Diego, California. The date on which the Closing takes place is
referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_." A certificate of merger
satisfying the applicable requirements of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") shall be duly executed by the Company and simultaneously with the
Closing shall be filed with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective upon the date and time of the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Office of the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware or such other date and time as may be mutually agreed
upon by Parent and the Company and set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the
" _Effective Time_ ").

 

1.4 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers.

 

At the Effective Time:

(a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in its entirety to
read as set forth in Exhibit B hereto, and, as so amended, shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with the DGCL and such Certificate of Incorporation;

 

(b) the Bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be amended and restated in their entirety to read as set forth in
Exhibit C hereto, and, as so amended, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and such
Bylaws; and

 

(c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
respective individuals who are directors and officers, respectively, of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time.

1.5 Conversion of Shares.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of
the Company:

(i) all shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any wholly-
owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Companys treasury)
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be paid in exchange therefor;

 

(ii) all shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub or any
other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be paid in exchange therefor;

 



2 (iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and subject to
Section 1.5(b) and Section 1.9, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive $32.00 in cash (the " _Per Share Merger Price_ "), without interest;
and

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Merger
Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one (1) share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) If, during the period commencing on the Agreement Date and ending at the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, then the Per Share Merger Price shall be appropriately adjusted.

1.6 Company Equity Awards; Warrants.

 

(a) Parent shall not assume any Company Options in connection with the Merger.
As of immediately prior to and conditioned upon the occurrence of the
Effective Time and without any action on the part of any optionholder, all
Company Options outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall fully vest and become exercisable. To the extent not exercised prior
to the Effective Time, then upon the Effective Time each Company Option shall
be canceled, with each former holder of any such canceled Company Option
becoming entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such
Company Option, an amount in cash, without interest and subject to deduction
for any required withholding Taxes, equal to the product of: (i) the excess,
if any, of the Per Share Merger Price over the exercise price of each such
Company Option; and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying such Company Option; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the exercise
price per share of any such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Per
Share Merger Price, such Company Option shall be canceled and terminated
without any cash payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof.

(b) Parent shall not assume any Company Restricted Stock Awards in connection
with the Merger. As of immediately prior to and conditioned upon the
occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action on the part of any
holder of any Company Restricted Stock Award, each Company Restricted Stock
Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or
not then vested, shall become fully vested immediately prior to, and then
shall be canceled at, the Effective Time (the " _Canceled Restricted Awards_
"), and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such Canceled
Restricted Awards shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash, without
interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding Taxes, equal
to the product of: (i) the Per Share Merger Price; and (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Canceled Restricted Awards.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as are
necessary to cause all Company Warrants that are outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and for which the holder has consented to the
treatment of such Company Warrants as

 



3  provided in this Section 1.6(c) (each, a " _Canceled Company Warrant_ "),
whether or not then vested and exercisable, to fully vest and to be canceled
as of the Effective Time in exchange for an amount in cash, without interest
and subject to deduction for any required withholding Taxes, in respect
thereof equal to the product of: (i) the excess, if any, of the Per Share
Merger Price over the exercise price of each such Canceled Company Warrant;
and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Canceled
Company Warrant.

(d) As soon as practicable following the Agreement Date and, in any event,
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as are
necessary to approve and effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section
1.6, including making any determinations or resolutions of the Company Board
or a committee thereof or any administrator of an Option Plan, and using
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents of holders of the
Company Warrants, as may be necessary.

(e) In accordance with the Option Plans, as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay, through the Surviving
Corporations payroll processor, to the former holders of Company Options
(with an exercise price that is less than the Per Share Merger Price) and to
the former holders of Canceled Restricted Awards such amounts as such holders
shall be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 1.6. The Surviving
Corporation shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its payroll
processor to effect such payments no later than five (5) Business Days after
the Effective Time.

1.7 Closing of the Companys Transfer Books. At the Effective Time: (a) all
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
all holders of certificates previously representing shares of Company Common
Stock or shares of Company Common Stock that are in non-certificated book-
entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights as
stockholders of the Company; and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such
shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books
after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate
previously representing any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Stock Certificate_ ")
or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Payment Agent or to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.8 below.

1.8 Surrender of Certificates.

 

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or
trust company to act as payment agent in the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_
"). At the Effective Time, Parent shall have deposited with the Payment Agent
cash sufficient to pay the cash consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.5
and Section 1.6(c). The cash amount so deposited with the Payment Agent is
referred to as the " _Payment Fund_." The Payment Agent will invest the funds
included in the Payment Fund in the manner directed by Parent; _provided,
however_ , that such 

 



4  investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of
such bank that are then publicly available). Any interest or other income
resulting from the investment of such funds shall be the property of and
payable to Parent.

(b) Within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, the Payment
Agent will mail to the Persons who were record holders of Company Stock
Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or Canceled Company Warrants immediately prior
to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit D; and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Company Stock Certificates or Canceled Company Warrants, or the procedure to
be followed in the case of Book-Entry Shares, in exchange for the Merger
Consideration or the consideration payable with respect to such Canceled
Company Warrants pursuant to Section 1.6(c), as applicable. Upon surrender of
a Company Stock Certificate, Book-Entry Shares or a Canceled Company Warrant,
as applicable, to the Payment Agent for exchange, together with a duly
executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the Payment Agent or Parent: (A) the holder of such Company Stock
Certificate, Book-Entry Shares or Canceled Company Warrant, as applicable,
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration or
the consideration payable with respect to such Canceled Company Warrants
pursuant to Section 1.6(c), as applicable; and (B) the Company
Stock Certificate, Book-Entry Shares or Canceled Company Warrant so
surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 1.8(b), each Company Stock Certificate, any Book-Entry Shares and each
Canceled Company Warrant shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time,
to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by Section 1.5 or the consideration payable with respect to such
Canceled Company Warrants pursuant to Section 1.6(c), as applicable. The cash
amount paid upon the surrender for exchange of Company Stock Certificates,
Book-Entry Shares or Canceled Company Warrants shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights of such holder pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock or Canceled Company Warrant, as applicable,
theretofore represented thereby. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent or the Payment Agent may, in
its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of any Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Company Stock Certificate, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit and to deliver a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Payment Agent,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock
Certificate.

(c) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including all interest and other income
received by the Payment Agent in respect of all funds made available to it)
that remains undistributed to holders of Company Stock Certificates, Book-
Entry Shares or Canceled Company Warrants as of the date that is nine (9)
months after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and
any holders of Company Stock Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or Canceled
Company Warrants who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock 

 



5  Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or Canceled Company Warrants, as applicable,
in accordance with and subject to this Section 1.8 shall thereafter look only
to Parent as general creditors for satisfaction of their claims for the
Merger Consideration or the consideration payable with respect to such
Canceled Company Warrants pursuant to Section 1.6(c), as applicable,
previously held by them.

 

(d) Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable to any holder
of any Company Stock Certificate, Book-Entry Shares or Canceled Company
Warrant (in his or her capacity as a holder of Company Common Stock or a
Canceled Company Warrant, as applicable) such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld from such consideration under the Code or any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable Legal
Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(e) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder
of any Company Stock Certificate, Book-Entry Shares or Canceled Company
Warrant or to any other Person with respect to any Merger Consideration
delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property
law, escheat law or similar Legal Requirement.

1.9 Dissenting Shares.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has properly made a demand
for appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (any
such shares being referred to as " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as
such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights
under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 1.5, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are
granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares. At the Effective Time,
the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Any cash deposited by Parent with the
Payment Agent in respect of shares of Company Common Stock that become
Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent promptly upon demand therefor; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status
as such within nine (9) months following the Closing Date, Parent shall return
the cash in respect of such shares to the Payment Agent.

 

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into
and shall represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 1.5 (and subject to Section 1.8(d)), without interest
thereon, upon surrender of the Company Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
representing such shares.

 



6 (c) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt written notice of (A)
any demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the DGCL, (B) any withdrawal of any such demand and (C) any other
demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to the DGCL; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or
instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer or
otherwise agree to any settlement prior to the Effective Time with respect to
any such demand, notice or instrument unless Parent shall have given its
written consent to such payment, settlement offer or settlement.

 

1.10 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub
and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of
the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

 

ARTICLE II.

expressly set forth herein, in the disclosure schedule delivered by the
Company to Parent and Merger Sub on the Agreement Date (the " _Disclosure
Schedule_ ") or in the Company SEC Documents filed with the SEC on or prior to
the Agreement Date (excluding any disclosures that constitute general
cautionary, predictive or forward-looking statements set forth in any section
of any Company SEC Document entitled "risk factors" or characterized therein
as "forward-looking statements" or any other statements that are similarly
forward-looking in nature, in each case, other than factual disclosures
contained therein).

(b) Each of the Acquired Corporations is qualified to do business as a foreign

Material Adverse Effect.

 



7 (c) The Company has no Subsidiaries, except for the Entity identified in Part
2.1(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, and neither the Company nor the Entity
identified in Part 2.1(c) of the Disclosure Schedule owns any capital stock

obligated to make or may become obligated to make any future investment in or
capital contribution to any other Entity.

Company has made available to Parent accurate and complete copies of the

Date shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made

36 4.3 Company Stockholder Meeting.

 

(a) As soon as practicable after the Agreement Date (and, in any event,
subject to Parents obligations in the immediately following sentence, within
fifteen (15) Business Days thereafter), the Company shall prepare and file
with the SEC a proxy statement (collectively, as amended or supplemented, the
" _Proxy Statement_ ") that will be provided to the Companys stockholders in
connection with solicitation of proxies for use at the meeting of the
Companys stockholders called to vote upon the Merger and the adoption of this
Agreement (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ "). Parent and Merger Sub, as
the case may be, shall furnish all information concerning Parent and Merger
Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable) as the Company may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC
of the Proxy Statement. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
disseminated to the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable
following the filing thereof with the SEC and confirmation from the SEC that
it will not comment on, or that it has no additional comments on, the Proxy
Statement. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct
any information provided by it or any of its respective Representatives for
use in the Proxy Statement if and to the extent that such information contains
any untrue statement of material fact or omits to state a material fact
required to be stated therein, or to the extent necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the
Proxy Statement, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated
to the Companys stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable Legal Requirements. The Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub
and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy
Statement prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent, Merger
Sub and their counsel (it being understood that Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon as reasonably practicable).
The Company shall provide in writing to Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel
any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, the Company or
its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement promptly after such receipt, and the Company shall provide Parent,
Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
any response to any such comments of the SEC or its staff, and the Company
shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by
Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel (it being understood that Parent, Merger
Sub and their counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon as
reasonably practicable). The Company shall respond as promptly as practicable
to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement.

(b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable after the Agreement Date, in
accordance with applicable Legal Requirements and the Company Charter
Documents, duly call, give notice of, set a single record date for, and
convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall ensure
that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting
are solicited in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements. Unless
a Change in Company Board Recommendation shall have occurred, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from the Companys
stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and shall take
any other reasonable measures to secure the Required

 



37  Stockholders Vote. Once the Company Stockholders Meeting has been noticed
and called, any postponement or adjournment of the Company Stockholders
Meeting shall require the prior written consent of the Parent other than in
the event that (i) such postponement or adjournment is advisable to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or
amended disclosure which the Company and its counsel reasonably determine is
necessary under applicable Legal Requirements and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Companys
stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, (ii) such postponement
or adjournment is required to obtain the Required Stockholder Vote or (iii)
the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable
Legal Requirements; _provided_ , that, if the Company Stockholders Meeting is
postponed or adjourned pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above to a date
that is later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Outside Date, then
the Outside Date shall be extended until the third (3rd) Business Day after
the date to which the Company Stockholders Meeting has been postponed or
adjourned. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may require the Company to
adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting one time (for a period of
not more than fifteen (15) days but not past the date that is two (2) Business
Days prior to the Outside Date), unless prior to such adjournment the Company
shall have received an aggregate number of proxies voting for the adoption of
this Agreement and the Merger, which have not been withdrawn, such that the
condition in Section 5.1(a) will be satisfied at such meeting. Once the
Company has established a record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting,
the Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record
date for the Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent
of Parent, unless required to do so by applicable Legal Requirements or the
Company Charter Documents. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with Section 6.1, the Company shall submit this Agreement to
its stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting even if the Company
Board shall have effected a Change in Company Board Recommendation. During the
last seven (7) Business Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, the Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent and at
reasonable intervals, advise Parent as to the aggregate tally of proxies
received by the Company with respect to the Required Stockholder Vote. Without
the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) shall be the only
matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by applicable
Legal Requirements to be voted on by the Companys stockholders in connection
with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby)
which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the
Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting.

 

4.4 No Solicitation by the Company; Other Offers.

(a) Subject to Section 4.4(b), from the Agreement Date until the Effective
Time or, if earlier, the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 6.1, the Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any
of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives to,
directly or indirectly through another Person: (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage, knowingly induce or knowingly take any other action
which would reasonably be expected to lead to, the making, submission or
announcement of, any proposal or inquiry that constitutes, or is reasonably
likely to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into, 

 



38  continue or participate in any discussions or any negotiations regarding any
proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to the
making, submission or announcement of, any Acquisition Proposal; (iii)
furnish any non-public information regarding the Company to any Person in
connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry that
would reasonably be expected to lead to the making, submission
or announcement of an Acquisition Proposal; (iv) approve or recommend an
Acquisition Proposal or any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or
other Contract contemplating an Acquisition Proposal or requiring the Company
to abandon or terminate its obligations under this Agreement; or (v) resolve
or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated all discussions or negotiations with any
Person previously conducted with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall promptly deny access to any data room (whether virtual or
actual) containing any confidential information previously furnished to any
Third Party relating to the consideration of any Acquisition Proposal by any
such Third Party.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.4 to the contrary, at any time
prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Stockholder Vote, in
response to an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal made after the date of
this Agreement in circumstances not involving a material breach of this
Agreement that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, the Company may,
upon a good faith determination by the Company Board (after receiving the
advice of its outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the Company Boards fiduciary
duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements: (i)
furnish information (including by providing access to a data room, whether
virtual or actual) with respect to the Acquired Corporations to the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal (and such Persons Representatives);
_provided, however,_ that all such information shall have been previously
provided to Parent or is provided to Parent at substantially the same time
that it is provided by the Company to such Person; and (ii) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
(and its Representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal; and _provided
further,_ that, prior to taking any of the actions described in clauses (i) or
(ii) above, the Company and such Person enter into a confidentiality
agreement in customary form that is no less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) after receipt, notify Parent of any Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or
request relating to an Acquisition Proposal or request for non-public
information relating to an Acquisition Proposal and, in any such notice to

notice copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such
Person that describe the material terms and conditions of such proposal,
inquiry or request), and (i) promptly (and, in any event, within three (3)

written request; (iv) adopt, approve or recommend, or otherwise declare
advisable the adoption of, any Acquisition Proposal or publicly propose to
adopt, approve or recommend, or otherwise declare advisable the adoption of,
any Acquisition Proposal; or (v) resolve to take any such actions (each such
foregoing action or failure to act in clauses "(i)" through "(v)" being
referred to as a " _Change in Company Board Recommendation_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board may, at any time prior to the
adoption of this Agreement by the Required Stockholder Vote, take any of the
actions set forth in Sections 4.4(d)(i)-(iii) below; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that prior to taking any such action the Company complies with Section 4.4(e)
of this Agreement:

(i) effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation in response to an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal in circumstances not
involving a material breach of this Agreement that is not withdrawn if the
Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Legal Requirements and the Company Board concludes in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and the Companys
financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal; 

(ii) effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation if the Company Board
concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach of its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Legal Requirements; and

 

(iii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(h) and enter into a
Company Acquisition Agreement, but only if the Company receives an
unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal in circumstances not
involving a material breach of this Agreement that is not withdrawn that the
Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel and the Companys financial advisor, constitutes a Superior
Proposal and the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that the failure to enter into such definitive
agreement would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 4.4(d), the
Company shall not be entitled to: (i) make a Change in Company Board
Recommendation pursuant to Section 4.4(d)(i) or Section 4.4(d)(ii); or (ii)
terminate this Agreement and enter into

 



40  any Company Acquisition Agreement pursuant to Section 4.4(d)(iii), unless:
(A) the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent that
it is prepared to (1) make a Change in Company Board Recommendation (a "
_Recommendation Change Notice_ ") or (2) terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 6.1(h) in response to a Superior Proposal (a " _Superior
Proposal Notice_ "), which notice shall, if the basis for the proposed action
by the Company Board is not related to a Superior Proposal, contain a
description of the events, facts and circumstances giving rise to such
proposed action or, if the basis for the proposed action by the Company Board
is a Superior Proposal, contain a description of the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal, including a copy of the Company
Acquisition Agreement in the form to be entered into (it being understood and
agreed that the delivery of such notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed
to be a Change in Company Board Recommendation); (B) the Company shall have
offered to negotiate with (and, if accepted, negotiated in good faith with)
Parent in making adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement;
and (C) Parent does not make, within three (3) Business Days after the receipt
of such notice, a proposal that would, in the good faith judgment of
the Company Board (after consultation with outside legal counsel and, in the
case of a Superior Proposal, the Companys financial advisor), cause such
events, facts and circumstances to no longer form the basis for the Company
Board to effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation or cause the
Acquisition Proposal previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal, as the case may be. Any material changes with
respect to such events, facts or circumstances mentioned above, or material
changes to the financial terms of such Superior Proposal, as the case may be,
occurring prior to the Companys effecting a Change in Company Board
Recommendation in accordance with the terms hereof or terminating this
Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(h) shall require the Company to provide to
Parent a new Recommendation Change Notice or Superior Proposal Notice and a
new three (3) Business Day period in which to negotiate.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 4.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from: (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; or (ii) making
any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment
of the Company Board, after consultation with outside legal counsel, failure
to so disclose would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ , that this Section 4.4(f) shall not
affect the obligations of the Company and the Company Board and the rights of
Parent and Merger Sub under Sections 4.4(d) and 4.4(e) of this Agreement, to
the extent applicable to such disclosure (it being understood that any "stop,
look and listen" letter or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not be deemed to be a Change in
Company Board Recommendation).

4.5 Reasonable Best Efforts.

 

(a) Each party shall make or cause to be made, in cooperation with the other
parties and to the extent applicable and as promptly as practicable (and in
any event within ten (10) Business Days): (i) an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
Merger; and (ii) all other necessary filings, forms, declarations,
notifications, registrations and notices with other Governmental Bodies under
any other antitrust,

 



41  competition, trade regulation, or other Legal Requirements relating to the
Merger (except as otherwise expressly provided herein). Each party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to: (A) respond at the earliest practicable date
to any requests for additional information made by the U.S. Department of
Justice, U.S. Federal Trade Commission or any other Governmental Body; (B) act
in good faith and reasonably cooperate with the other party in connection
with any investigation by any Governmental Body; (C) furnish to each other all
information required for any filing, form, declaration, notification,
registration and notice, subject to advice of such partys antitrust counsel;
and (D) take all other actions reasonably necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or any foreign
antitrust, competition or similar Legal Requirements. In connection with the
foregoing: (1) whenever possible, each party shall give the other party
reasonable prior notice of any communication with, and any proposed
understanding or agreement with, any Governmental Body regarding any
filings, forms, declarations, notifications, registrations or notices, and
permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith
the views of the other in connection with, any proposed communication,
understanding or agreement with any Governmental Body with respect to the
Merger, subject to advice of such partys antitrust counsel; (2) where
reasonably practical, none of the parties hereto shall independently
participate in any meeting or conversation, or engage in any substantive
conversation with any Governmental Body in respect of any filings or inquiry
without giving the other party prior notice of the meeting or conversation
and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Body, the opportunity to attend
or participate; (3) if one party is prohibited by applicable Legal
Requirements or by the applicable Governmental Body from participating in or
attending any meetings, conferences or conversations, the attending party
shall keep the other reasonably apprised with respect thereto; and (4) the
parties hereto shall consult and cooperate with one another in connection with
any information or proposals submitted in connection with proceedings under or
relating to any antitrust laws. Without limiting the foregoing, but subject
to Section 4.5(b) and Section 4.5(c), the Company and Parent shall each use
its reasonable best efforts to eliminate impediments under any antitrust law
that may be asserted by any Governmental Body so as to enable the Closing to
occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event, not later than the
Outside Date).

 

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or parties hereto in
doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Legal Requirements or otherwise to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary
actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and
authorizations from all Governmental Bodies and make all necessary
registrations, declarations and filings with all Governmental Bodies, that are
necessary to consummate the Merger; _provided, however_ , that in no event
shall Parent or Merger Sub be obligated to, and the Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent, agree to or proffer any consent fee,
concession or other modification to the terms and conditions of any Contract
in order to obtain any consents contemplated by this Section 4.5(b).

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
the Company shall not, without Parents prior written consent, commit to any
divestiture

 



42  transaction or agree to any restriction on its business, and nothing in this
Section 4.5 shall (i) limit any applicable rights a party may have to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1 so long as such party has up
to then complied in all material respects with its obligations under this
Section 4.5, or (ii) require Parent to offer, accept or agree to (A) dispose
of or hold separate, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or hold
separate, any part of the businesses, operations, assets or product lines of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (or a combination
of the respective businesses, operations, assets or product lines of Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries), (B) not compete in any
geographic area or line of business, (C) restrict, prohibit or limit the
ownership or operation by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of all or any
portion of the business or assets of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates in any part of the world,
(D) divest, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to divest, any shares of Company
Common Stock, or (E) impose limitations on the ability of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries effectively to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of
ownership of the shares of Company Common Stock, including the right to vote
any shares of Company Common Stock acquired or owned by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries on all matters properly presented to the Companys stockholders.

4.6 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Except as permitted in
accordance with Section 4.4, Parent and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing, and, to the extent practicable, give each other the
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statements with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and consider in good faith the views of the other party,
and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Legal
Requirements, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of any securities exchange or trading market on which
securities of Parent or the Company are listed, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to allow the other party or parties hereto reasonable time
to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance (it
being understood that the final form and content of any such release or
announcement, as well as the timing of any such release or announcement, shall
be at the final discretion of the disclosing party).

 

4.7 Director and Officer Liability.

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary thereof, Parent shall cause the Company or Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, to: (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless all past and present
directors and officers of the Acquired Corporations as of the Effective Time
(such Persons, " _Indemnified Persons_ "), against any costs or expenses
(including attorneys fees and expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, and provide advancement of expenses to such
Indemnified Persons to the same extent such persons are indemnified or have
the right to advancement of expenses as of the Agreement Date by the Company
pursuant to the Company

 



43  Charter Documents and the indemnification agreements of the Company in
existence on the date hereof with any directors and officers of the Company;
and (ii) include and cause to be maintained in effect in the Company or the
Surviving Corporations (or any successors), as the case may be, charter and
bylaws the current provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors,
indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of
expenses contained in the Company Charter Documents. If the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or any of their respective
successors or assigns: (A) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporations or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (B) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations
set forth in this Section 4.7. 

(b) The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a six (6) year
"tail" prepaid policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Persons than the existing directors and officers liability (and
fiduciary) insurance maintained by the Company, covering, without limitation,
the Merger.

 

4.8 Notification of Certain Events. Each of the Company and Parent shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, notify the other: 

(a) upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by it in this
Agreement was at the time made untrue or inaccurate in any material respect
or has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure
of such Person to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect or
be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of such party set forth
herein or the conditions to the obligations of the other party to consummate
the Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereto;

(b) to the extent the Company or Parent, as the case may be, has Knowledge of
such notice or communication, of any written communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is required in connection with the
Merger;

 

(c) without limitation of the parties respective obligations under Section
4.5, of any written communication from any Governmental Body related to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereunder;

(d) of any Legal Proceedings commenced and served on the Company or, to its
Knowledge, threatened in writing against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that,
(i) if pending on the Agreement Date, would have been required to have been
disclosed pursuant to any Section of this Agreement, or (ii) relates to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder; and

 



44 (e) any event, condition, fact or circumstance (i) that would make the
timely satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in Article V
impossible or unlikely or (ii) that has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

4.9 Shareholder Litigation. Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the
date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1: (a) the
Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing of any shareholder litigation
against the Company or its directors relating to this Agreement or the Merger
and shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such shareholder
litigation; and (b) the Company shall control such defense and this Section
4.9 shall not give Parent the right to direct such defense; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no settlement of such litigation shall be agreed to without
Parents prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

4.10 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities
of the Company (including any derivative securities) or acquisitions of
equity securities of Parent by each individual (including directors by
deputization) who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

4.11 Employee Matters. 

(a) For purposes of this Section 4.11: (i) the term " _Covered Employees_ "
shall mean employees who are actively employed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries at the Effective Time; and (ii) the term " _Continuation Period_
" shall mean the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the
first anniversary of the Effective Time.

(b) Base Compensation. For the Continuation Period, Parent shall provide, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to each Covered Employee, an
annual base salary or hourly rate of pay that is no less than the base salary
or hourly rate of pay that such Covered Employee received from the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) Bonuses During Continuation Period. During the Continuation Period, Parent
shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide each Covered Employee with
an annual cash bonus opportunity that is at least substantially comparable to
those offered by the Company immediately before the Effective Time at target
base salary multiples (or other target amounts) that are no less favorable
than the target base salary multiples or other targets in effect for such
Covered Employee during 2012, but with payment based on achievement of
performance criteria determined by Parent and applicable generally to
similarly situated or comparable employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries in a
consistent and good faith manner during the Continuation Period.

(d) Benefit Plans. During the Continuation Period, Parent shall maintain or
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain employee benefit plans, programs,
policies and arrangements for Covered Employees that are substantially
similar in the aggregate to the Company Employee Plans identified on Part
2.15(a) of the Disclosure Schedule (other than the

 



45  bonus plans described in Sections 4.11(c) above, equity compensation and
other, long-term incentives, change in control, retention, transition, stay or
similar arrangements) that were in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

(e) Crediting of Payments. In the event any Covered Employee first becomes
eligible to participate under any employee benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement of the Parent or Surviving Corporation (" _Parent Employee Benefit
Plan_ ") following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to: (i) waive any pre-existing condition exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to any Covered Employee under any Parent Employee Benefit Plan
providing medical, dental, or vision benefits to the same extent such
limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the employee benefit plan
Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage under the
Parent Employee Benefit Plan; and (ii) provide each Covered Employee with
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Covered
Employees coverage under any Parent Employee Benefit Plan during the calendar
year in which such amount was paid, to the same extent such credit was given
under the employee benefit plan Covered Employee participated in immediately
prior to coverage under the Parent Employee Benefit Plan, in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the Parent Employee
Benefit Plan.

(f) Service Crediting. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall recognize, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to recognize, all service of each
Covered Employee prior to the Effective Time, to the Acquired Corporations (as
well as predecessor entities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) for
vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for benefit of accrual purposes,
except for vacation and severance, as applicable); for the avoidance of doubt,
service of each Covered Employee prior to the Effective Time shall not be
recognized for the purpose of any entitlement to participate in, or receive
benefits with respect to, any: (i) employer contributions under any Parent
401(k) plan; or (ii) Parent retiree medical program or other retiree welfare
benefit program in which any Covered Employee participates after the
Effective Time. In no event shall anything contained in this Section 4.11(f)
result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

(g) ESPP. Prior to the Effective Time, if permitted pursuant to the terms of
the ESPP, the Company shall take all actions that may be necessary to: (i)
cause the exercise (as of the last Business Day prior to the Closing Date) of
each outstanding purchase right under the ESPP, and make any pro-rata
adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period but
otherwise cause such shortened offering period to be treated as a fully
effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the ESPP; and
(ii) provide that no further offering period or purchase period shall commence
under the ESPP after the Effective Time; _provided_ , _ however_ , that such
exercise of outstanding purchase rights, and the cessation of further offering
and purchase periods, shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the
Merger. On the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall apply the funds credited as of such date under the ESPP
within each participants payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP.
Immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time (and subject to
the consummation of the Merger), the Company shall terminate the ESPP. Each
share of Company Common Stock purchased under the ESPP shall be automatically
converted into the right to 

 



46  receive the Per Share Merger Price on the same basis as all other shares of
Company Common Stock, except that each such share shall be automatically
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Price without the
issuance of a certificate representing such share.

(h) Nothing in this Section 4.11 shall be construed to limit the right of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Effective Time,
the Acquired Corporations) to amend or terminate any Company Employee Plan or
other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is
permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, nor shall anything in this
Section 4.11 be construed to require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, following the Effective Time, the Acquired Corporations) to
retain the employment of any particular Covered Employee for any fixed period
of time following the Effective Time. Nothing in this agreement shall
constitute an amendment to any Company Employee Plan, and no Company Employee
Plan shall be amended absent a separate written amendment that complies with
such plans amendment procedures.

4.12 Confidentiality. The parties acknowledge that Parent and the Company are
bound by a mutual non-disclosure agreement, dated as of April 16, 2010 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms, except
as expressly modified herein.

4.13 Deregistration; Stock Exchange Delisting. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Legal Requirements and rules and policies of Nasdaq to cause the
delisting of the Company Common Stock from Nasdaq as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time and deregistration of the Company Common Stock under
the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting. The Company
shall not cause the Company Common Stock to be delisted from Nasdaq prior to
the Effective Time.

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

7.1 Amendment or Supplement. At any time prior to the Effective Time, this
Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether
before or after receipt of the Required Stockholder Vote, by written
agreement signed by all of the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that
following approval of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders, there
shall be no amendment of or change to the provisions of this Agreement which,
pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, would require further approval by
the Companys stockholders without receipt of such approval.

 



51 7.2 Extension of Time, Waiver, etc. At any time prior to the Effective Time,

Requirements: (a) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
of any other party hereto; (b) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or acts of any other party hereto; or (c) waive compliance by
any other party with any of the agreements contained in this Agreement or,
except as otherwise provided in the Agreement, waive any of such partys
conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate
as a waiver of rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such rights
preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or the exercise of any
other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. 

7.3 No Additional Representations; No Survival. Each party hereto agrees that,
except for the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or
in any certificates delivered pursuant to this Agreement, neither Parent and
Merger Sub nor the Company makes any other representations or warranties, and
each hereby disclaims any other representations or warranties, express or
implied, or as to the accuracy or completeness of any other information, made
by, or made available by, itself or any of its Representatives, with respect
to, or in connection with, the negotiation, execution or delivery of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, notwithstanding the
delivery or disclosure to the other or the others Representatives of any
documentation or other information with respect to any one or more of the
foregoing. None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in
any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the
Effective Time. This Section 7.3 shall not limit the survival of any covenant
or agreement of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement which by its
terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.

7.4 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiary. This Agreement, including
the exhibits and schedules hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the documents and
instruments relating to the Merger referred to in this Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement is
not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon
any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, to create any agreement of employment with any Person or to
otherwise create any third party beneficiary hereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the following Persons are intended as third party beneficiaries of
this Agreement, solely after the Effective Time, solely with respect to

and, solely with respect to Section 4.7, the directors and officers of the
Company covered by Section 4.7.

7.5 Applicable Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the

 



52  State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under
applicable principles of conflicts of laws. All actions and proceedings
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the negotiation, validity or
performance of this Agreement, or the Merger shall be heard and determined
exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and the parties
irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of such court (and, in the case of
appeals, the appropriate appellate court therefrom), in any such action or
proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any such action or proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction set
forth in this paragraph shall not constitute general consents to service of
process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose
except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights
on any Person other than the parties hereto. The parties agree that service
of any court paper may be made in any manner as may be provided in Section 7.9
(other than by facsimile) and otherwise under the applicable Legal
Requirements or court rules governing service of process in such court. The
parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Legal Requirements.

7.6 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS ANY AND ALL RIGHTS
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter
into this Agreement and the Merger, as applicable, by, among other things, the
mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 7.6.

7.7 Specific Enforcement. Notwithstanding Section 6.3 of this Agreement, the
parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur for which monetary
damages would not be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with the terms
hereof or are otherwise breached, and that, in addition to any other remedy to
which it may be entitled at law or in equity, the party seeking to enforce
this Agreement against such nonperforming party under this Agreement shall be
entitled to specific performance and the issuance of injunctive and other
equitable relief to prevent any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.
The parties hereto further agree to waive any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or
other equitable relief.

 

7.8 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in
whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that Merger
Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests
and obligations under this Agreement to any one or more direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent without the consent of the Company, but no
such assignment shall relieve Merger Sub of any of its obligations under this
Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns.

provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that

unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and
enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace

of stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and to adjourn
the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all
such acts as, in the judgment of such presiding person, are appropriate for
the proper conduct of the meeting. The presiding

 



3  person at any meeting of stockholders, in addition to making any other
determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall,
if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter or
business was not properly brought before the meeting and if such presiding
person should so determine, such presiding person shall so declare to the
meeting and any such matter or business not properly brought before

bylaws to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the

of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and
without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken,
shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the
minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less
than unanimous written consent shall, to the extent required by law, be given
to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the
action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the
meeting if the record date for such meeting had been the date that written
consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action
were delivered to the Corporation.

An electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted
by a stockholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a
stockholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated for purposes of
this Section 13, _provided_ that any such electronic transmission sets forth
or is delivered with information from which the Corporation can determine (a)
that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the stockholder, or by a
person or persons authorized to act for the stockholder, and (b) the date on
which such stockholder or authorized person or persons transmitted such
electronic transmission. The date on which such electronic transmission is
transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which such consent was signed.

number of directors, shall be filled by a majority vote of the directors then
in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and
the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election and
until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner
displaced. If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors
may be held in the manner provided by statute.

Section 4.  _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the board of directors
may be held at such places within or without the State of Delaware and at such
times as the board of directors may from time to time determine.

 

Section 5\. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the board of directors
may be held at any time or place within or without the State of Delaware
whenever called by the President, any Vice President, the Secretary, or by any
member of the board of directors.

Section 6\. _Notice of Meetings_. The Secretary or other person or persons
calling a meeting shall give notice by mail or confirmed facsimile or
electronic transmission at least three days before the meeting, or by
telephone at least twenty-four hours before the meeting. Except as otherwise
herein provided, neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of,
any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in
this notice of such meeting. A written waiver of notice signed by the director
entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be
equivalent to notice. Attendance of a director at the meeting shall constitute
a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the director attends a
meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting,
to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called
or convened.

 



5 Section 7\. _Quorum; Required Vote; Adjourned Meetings_. At all meetings of
the board or any committee thereof, a majority of directors or committee
members shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The act of
a majority of the directors or committee members present at any meeting at
which there is a quorum shall be the act of the board of directors or
committee, as the case may be, except as may be otherwise specifically
provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If a quorum shall
not be present at any meeting of the board of directors or committee thereof,
the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time,
without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be
present. In the event that such board or committee is composed of an even
number of persons, a majority means one-half of the number of such persons
plus one.

Section 8.  _Action Without Meetings; Telephone Meeting_. Unless otherwise
restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, any action
required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the board of directors or
of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of
the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by
electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic
transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of
the board or committee.

Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these
bylaws, members of the board of directors or any committee designated by such
board, may participate in a meeting of such board or committee by means of
conference telephone or other communications equipment by which all persons
participating in the meeting can hear each other and participation in a
meeting pursuant to this Section 8 shall constitute presence in person at such
meeting.

Section 9\. _Committees_. The board of directors may designate one or more
committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the
Corporation. The board may designate one or more directors as alternate
members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at
any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member
of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not
disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may
unanimously appoint another member of the board of directors to act at the
meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Such committee
or committees shall have such member or members as may be determined from
time to time by resolution adopted by the board of directors. Any such
committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the board of directors
and to the extent permitted under applicable statutory provisions, shall have
and may exercise all the power and authority of the board of directors in the
management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize
the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it.

 



6 Section 10\. _Committee Minutes_. Each committee shall keep regular minutes of
its meetings and report the same to the board of directors when required.

Section 11\. _Compensation_. The directors may be paid their expenses, if
any, of attendance at each meeting of the board of directors and may be paid a
fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the board of directors or a stated
salary as director. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving
the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.
Members of special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation for
attending committee meetings.

 

Section 12\. _Resignation_. Any director of the Corporation may resign at any
time by giving notice in writing or by electronic transmission to the
President or to the Secretary of the Corporation. The resignation of any
director shall take effect at the time specified therein; and, unless
otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be
necessary to make it effective.

Section 13\. _Removal_. Any director or the entire board of directors may be
removed, at any time, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of
the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors, except as may be
provided by statute or the certificate of incorporation.

 

ARTICLE IV

 

NOTICES

 

Section 1\. _General; Electronic Transmission_. Whenever, under the
provisions of statute or of the certificate of incorporation or of these
bylaws, notice is required to be given to any director or stockholder, it
shall be construed to mean written notice by (a) personal delivery or by mail,
addressed to such director or stockholder, at his address as it appears on
the records of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid, and such notice
shall be deemed to be given at the time when the same shall be deposited in
the United States mail, or (b) by electronic transmission as set forth
below. Notice to directors may also be given by telephone or electronic
transmission.

Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given
effectively to the stockholders, any notice given by the Corporation to the
stockholders shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission
consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent
shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Corporation.
Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (a) the Corporation is unable to
deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the
Corporation in accordance with such consent and (b) such inability becomes

 



7  known to the Corporations Secretary, an Assistant Secretary, transfer agent
or other person responsible for giving such notice; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall
not invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given by electronic
transmission shall be deemed given: (i) if by facsimile, when directed to a
number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice, (ii) if by
electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the
stockholder has consented to receive notice, (iii) if by posting on an
electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such
specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of
such separate notice, and (iv) if by any other form of electronic
transmission, when directed to the stockholder.

 

Section 2\. _Waiver of Notice_. Whenever any notice is required to be given
under the provisions of the statutes or of the certificate of incorporation
or of these bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or
persons entitled to said notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the
person entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated
therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a
meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the
person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the
beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be
transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the
stockholders, directors or members of a committee of directors need be
specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic
transmission unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these
bylaws.

ARTICLE V

OFFICERS

 

Section 1\. _Officers; Election; Resignation; Removal; Vacancies; Salaries_.
The board of directors shall elect a President and Secretary, and it may, if
it so determines, choose a Chairperson of the Board and a Vice Chairperson of
the Board from among its members. The board of directors may also choose one
or more Vice Presidents, one or more Assistant Secretaries, a Treasurer and
one or more Assistant Treasurers and such other officers as it shall from time
to time deem necessary or desirable. Each such officer shall hold office until
the first meeting of the board of directors after the annual meeting
of stockholders next succeeding his or her election, and until his or her
successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or
removal. Any officer may resign at any time upon written notice to the
Corporation. The board of directors may remove any officer with or without
cause at any time, but such removal shall be without prejudice to the
contractual rights of such officer, if any, with the Corporation. Any number
of offices may be held by the same person. Any vacancy occurring in any
office of the Corporation by death, resignation, removal or otherwise may be
filled for the unexpired portion of the term by the board of directors. The
salaries of all officers and agents of the Corporation shall be fixed by or
in the manner prescribed by the board of directors.

 



8 Section 2\. _Execution of Documents_. All deeds, mortgages, bonds, contracts,
and other instruments may be executed on behalf of the Corporation by the
President or by any other person or persons designated from time to time by
the board of directors or the President, unless such power is restricted by
board resolution. 

Section 3\. _Powers and Duties of Officers_. The officers of the Corporation
shall have such powers and duties in the management of the Corporation as may
be prescribed by the board of directors and, to the extent not so provided, as
generally pertain to their respective offices, subject to the control of the
board of directors. The board of directors may require any officer, agent or
employee to give security for the faithful performance of his or her duties.

ARTICLE VI 

INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES

 

Section 1\. _Directors and Executive Officers_. The Corporation shall
indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent not prohibited by
the DGCL or any other applicable law; provided, however, that the Corporation
may modify the extent of such indemnification by individual contracts with its
directors and officers; and, provided, further, that the Corporation
shall not be required to indemnify any director or officer in connection with
any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless (i) such
indemnification is expressly required to be made by law, (ii) the proceeding
was authorized by the board of directors of the Corporation, (iii) such
indemnification is provided by the Corporation, in its sole discretion,
pursuant to the powers vested in the Corporation under the DGCL or any other
applicable law or (iv) such indemnification is required to be made under
Section 4 below.

Section 2\. _Other Employees and Other Agents_. The Corporation shall have
power to indemnify its other employees and other agents as set forth in the
DGCL or any other applicable law. The board of directors of the Corporation
shall have the power to delegate the determination of whether indemnification
shall be given to any such person to such officers or other persons as the
board of directors shall determine.

 

Section 3\. _Expenses_. The Corporation shall advance to any person who was or
is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or
executive officer, of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director or executive officer of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final
disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all
expenses incurred by any director or executive officer in connection with
such proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person
to repay said amounts if it should be determined ultimately that such person
is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VI or otherwise.

 



9 Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to Section
5 of this Article VI, no advance shall be made by the Corporation to an
officer of the Corporation (except by reason of the fact that such officer is
or was a director of the Corporation in which event this paragraph shall not
apply) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, if a determination is reasonably and promptly
made (i) by the board of directors of the Corporation by a majority vote of a
quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the proceeding, or
(ii) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of
disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written
opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such
determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person
acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or
not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation.

 

Section 4\. _Enforcement_. Without the necessity of entering into an express
contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and
executive officers under this bylaw shall be deemed to be contractual rights
and be effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract
between the Corporation and the director or executive officer. Any right to
indemnification or advances granted by this Article VI to a director or
executive officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding
such right in any court of competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for
indemnification or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no
disposition of such claim is made within ninety (90) days of request therefor.
The claimant in such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part,
shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting the claim. In
connection with any claim for indemnification, the corporation shall be
entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the claimant has not
met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the DGCL or any
other applicable law for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the
amount claimed. In connection with any claim by an executive officer of the
Corporation (except in any action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that
such executive officer is or was a director of the Corporation) for advances,
the Corporation shall be entitled to raise a defense as to any such action
clear and convincing evidence that such person acted in bad faith or in a
manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation, or with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding that such person acted without reasonable cause to believe that
his conduct was lawful. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its
board of directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have
made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has
met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL or any other
applicable law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its
board of directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the
claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense
to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable
standard of conduct. In any suit brought by a director or executive officer
to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses
hereunder, the burden of proving that the director or executive officer is not
entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this
Article VI or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

 



10 Section 5\. _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person by
this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person
may have or hereafter acquire under any applicable statute, provision of the
certificate of incorporation, the bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The
Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with
any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting
indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the
DGCL, or by any other applicable law.

Section 6\. _Survival of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person by this
Article VI shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director,
officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
executors and administrators of such a person.

Section 7\. _Insurance_. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or any
other applicable law, the Corporation, upon approval by the board of directors
of the Corporation, may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or
permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Article VI.

Section 8\. _Amendments_. Any repeal or modification of this Article VI shall
only be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Article in
effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act
that is the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the Corporation.

 

Section 9\. If this Article VI or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on
any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall
nevertheless indemnify each director and executive officer to the full extent
not prohibited by any applicable portion of this Article VI that shall not
have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law. If this Article
VI shall be invalid due to the application of the indemnification provisions
of another jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall indemnify each director
and executive officer to the full extent under any other applicable law.

 

Section 10\. _Certain Definitions_. For the purposes of this Article, the
following definitions shall apply:

 

(1) The term "proceeding" shall be broadly construed and shall include,
without limitation, the investigation, preparation, prosecution, defense,
settlement, arbitration and appeal of, and the giving of testimony in, any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative.

 

(2) The term "expenses" shall be broadly construed and shall include, without
limitation, court costs, attorneys fees, witness fees, fines, amounts paid
in settlement or judgment and any other costs and expenses of any nature or
kind incurred in connection with any proceeding.

(3) The term the "Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) 

 



11  absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had
continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors,
officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or
was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position
under the provisions of this Article VI with respect to the resulting or
surviving corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent
corporation if its separate existence had continued.

(4) References to a "director," "executive officer," "officer," "employee,"
or "agent" of the Corporation shall include, without limitation, situations
where such person is serving at the request of the Corporation as,
respectively, a director, executive officer, officer, employee, trustee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise.

(5) References to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans;
references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with
respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request
of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves
services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with respect to an
employee, benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who
acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the
interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan
shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests
of the Corporation" as referred to in this Article VI.

ARTICLE VII

 

CERTIFICATES OF STOCK

Section 1\. _General_. The shares of the Corporation may, but need not be,
represented by certificates. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares
represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the
Corporation. Every holder of stock represented by certificates shall be
entitled to have a certificate signed by or in the name of the Corporation by
the Chairperson or Vice Chairperson of the board of directors, if any, or the
President or a Vice President, and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer,
or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, of the Corporation certifying the
number of shares owned by such holder in the Corporation. Any of the
signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer,
transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has
been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer
agent, or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by
the Corporation with the same effect as if such person were such officer,
transfer agent, or registrar at the date of issue.

Section 2\. _Transfers of Stock_. Upon surrender to the Corporation or the
transfer agent of the Corporation of a certificate for shares in compliance
with the requirements of Section 8-401 of Title 6 of

 



12  the Delaware Code Annotated, as amended, it shall be the duty of the
Corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel
the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.

Section 3\. _Lost or Destroyed Stock Certificates; Issuance of New
Certificates_. The Corporation may issue a new certificate of stock in the
place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may require the owner of the lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, or such owners legal representative, to
give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that
may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of
any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or
uncertificated shares.

Section 4\. _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record_.
In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment
thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution
or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of
any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record
date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record
date is adopted by the board of directors, and which record date: (i) in the
case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of
stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law,
not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting;
(ii) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to express consent
to corporate action in writing without a meeting, shall not precede nor be
more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record
date is adopted by the board of directors; and (iii) in the case of any
other action, shall not be more than sixty days prior to such other action.
If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given,
or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding
the day on which the meeting is held; (2) the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting, when no prior action of the board of directors is required
by law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting
forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the
Corporation in accordance with applicable law, or, if prior action by the
board of directors is required by law, shall be at the close of business on
the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such
prior action; and (3) the record date for determining stockholders for any
other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board
of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of
stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however,
that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned
meeting.

 



13 Section 5\. _Registered Stockholders_. The Corporation shall be entitled
to treat the record holder of any shares of the Corporation as the owner
thereof for all purposes, including all rights deriving from such shares, and
shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to, or interest
in, such shares or rights deriving from such shares, on the part of any other
person, including, but without limiting the generality thereof, a purchaser,
assignee or transferee of such shares or rights deriving from such shares,
unless and until such purchaser, assignee, transferee or other person becomes
the record holder of such shares, whether or not the Corporation shall have
either actual or constructive notice of the interest of such purchaser,
assignee, transferee or other person. Any such purchaser, assignee,
transferee or other person shall not be entitled to receive notice of the
meetings of stockholders, to vote at such meetings, to examine a complete list
of the stockholders entitled to vote at meetings, or to own, enjoy,
and exercise any other property or rights deriving from such shares against
the Corporation, until such purchaser, assignee, transferee or other person
has become the record holder of such shares.

 

ARTICLE VIII

INTERESTED OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS

No contract or transaction between this Corporation and one or more of its
directors or officers, or between this Corporation and any other corporation,
partnership, association, or other organization in which one or more of its
directors or officers are directors or officers, or have a financial
interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because
the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the
board or committee thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction, or
solely because any such directors or officers votes are counted for such
purpose, if:

(a) The material facts as to the directors or officers relationship or
interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to
the board of directors or the committee, and the board or committee in good
faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a
majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested
directors be less than a quorum; or

(b) The material facts as to the directors or officers relationship or
interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to
the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is
specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or

(c) The contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time
it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the board of directors, a committee
thereof, or the stockholders.

Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the presence of a
quorum at a meeting of the board of directors or of a committee which
authorized the contract or transaction.

-4-  INSTRUCTIONS

1\. GUARANTEE OF SIGNATURES. All signatures on this Letter of Transmittal must
be guaranteed by a firm which is a member of the Security Transfer Agent
Medallion Signature Program, or by any other "eligible guarantor
institution," as such term is defined in Rule 17Ad-15 promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (each of the foregoing being an
"Eligible Institution") unless (i) this Letter of Transmittal is signed by
the registered holder(s) of Shares and/or Warrants surrendered hereby and such
holder(s) has (have) not completed the box entitled "Special Payment
Instructions" or "Special Delivery Instructions" set forth above or (ii) such
Shares and/or Warrants are surrendered for the account of an Eligible
Institution. See Instruction 4.

2\. DELIVERY OF LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND SHARE CERTIFICATES AND/OR WARRANTS
_._ The Share Certificates surrendered hereby, or timely confirmation of a
book-entry transfer of Shares into the account of the Payment Agent (a "Book-
Entry Confirmation") and/or Warrants, as applicable, together with a properly
completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal (or a manually signed
facsimile thereof) and any other documents required by this Letter of
Transmittal, must be received by the Payment Agent at one of its addresses set
forth on the cover page hereof in order to make an effective surrender. A
mailing envelope addressed to the Payment Agent is enclosed for
your convenience.

THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, SHARE CERTIFICATES
AND/OR WARRANTS AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS IS AT THE OPTION AND RISK OF
THE SHAREHOLDER OR WARRANT HOLDER, AS APPLICABLE, AND DELIVERY WILL BE DEEMED
MADE ONLY WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE PAYMENT AGENT. IF DELIVERY IS BY MAIL,
REGISTERED MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, PROPERLY INSURED, IS
RECOMMENDED.

3\. INADEQUATE SPACE. If the space provided on the cover page hereof under
"Description of Securities Surrendered" is inadequate, the Share Certificate
and/or Warrant, as applicable, numbers and the number of Shares evidenced by
such Share Certificates and/or covered by such Warrants should be listed on
a separately signed schedule and attached hereto.

4\. SIGNATURES ON LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL; STOCK POWERS AND ENDORSEMENTS. If
this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of Shares
and/or Warrants surrendered hereby, the signature(s) must correspond with the
name(s) as written on the face of the Share Certificates evidencing such
Shares and/or on the face of the Warrants, as applicable, without alteration,
enlargement or any other change whatsoever.

If any Shares or Warrants surrendered hereby are held of record by two or
more persons, all such persons must sign this Letter of Transmittal.

 

If any Shares or Warrants surrendered hereby are registered in different
names, it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as many separate
Letters of Transmittal as there are different registrations of such Shares or
Warrants.

If the surrendered Share Certificate(s) or Warrant(s) have been transferred
or assigned, this Letter of Transmittal should be signed by the transferee or
assignee and not by the transferor or assignor. If a Share Certificate or
Warrant is registered in the name of joint holders with right of survivorship
and one or more of the owners is deceased, the surviving holder(s) should sign
the Letter of Transmittal and furnish a letter providing information
concerning the death of the registered holder(s).

 

If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of Shares
surrendered hereby, no endorsements of Share Certificates or separate stock
powers are required, unless payment is to be made to a person other than the
registered holder(s). If the Letter of Transmittal is signed by a person other
than the registered holder(s) of the Share Certificate(s) evidencing
Shares surrendered, the Share Certificate(s) surrendered hereby must be
endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case signed
exactly as the name(s) of the registered holder(s) appear(s) on such Share
Certificate(s). Signatures on such Share Certificate(s) and stock powers must
be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution.

 



-5-  If this Letter of Transmittal or any Share Certificate or stock power is
signed by a trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, attorney-in-fact,
officer of a corporation or other person acting in a fiduciary or
representative capacity, such person should so indicate when signing, and
proper evidence satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation of such persons
authority so to act must be submitted.

For a correction of name, or for a change in name which does not involve a
change of ownership, proceed as follows: (i) for a change in name by marriage,
the surrendered Share Certificate(s) and this Letter of Transmittal should be
endorsed or signed, e.g., "Mary Doe, now by marriage Mary Jones", with the
signatures guaranteed as described in Instruction 1; and (ii) for a correction
in name, the surrendered Share Certificate(s) and this Letter of Transmittal
should be endorsed or signed, e.g., "James E. Brown, incorrectly inscribed as
J.E. Brown", with the signatures guaranteed as described in Instruction 1. In
addition, the "Special Payment Instructions" box set forth above must provide
all appropriate registration information. Please contact the Payment Agent
with any questions.

5\. TRANSFER TAXES. __ Except as otherwise provided in this Instruction 5,
the Surviving Corporation will pay or cause to be paid all transfer taxes
applicable to the Merger. If, however, payment of the Merger Consideration for
any of the Shares or the payment of the Warrant Consideration for the
Warrants surrendered is to be made to any person other than the registered
holder(s) or if surrendered Share Certificates or Warrants are registered in
the name of any person other than the person(s) signing the Letter of
Transmittal, the amount of any transfer taxes (whether imposed on the
registered holder(s), or such other person, or otherwise) payable on account
of the transfer to such other person will be deducted from the purchase price
for such Shares and/or Warrants surrendered, unless evidence satisfactory to
the Surviving Corporation of the payment of such taxes, or exemption
therefrom, is submitted.

 

EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS INSTRUCTION 5, IT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY FOR
TRANSFER TAX STAMPS TO BE AFFIXED TO THE SHARE CERTIFICATES EVIDENCING SHARES
OR WARRANTS SURRENDERED HEREBY.

6\. SPECIAL PAYMENT AND DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS. If a check for payment for any
of the Shares or Warrants surrendered hereby is to be issued in the name of a
person other than the person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal or if such
check is to be sent to a person other than the signor of this Letter
of Transmittal or to the person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal but at
an address other than that shown in the box entitled "Description of
Securities Surrendered," the appropriate boxes herein must be completed.

 

7\. QUESTIONS AND REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE OR ADDITIONAL COPIES _._ Questions
and requests for assistance may be directed to, and additional copies of this
Letter of Transmittal, and the Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer
Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9 may be obtained from the Payment
Agent at one of its addresses or telephone numbers set forth on the cover
page hereof.

8\. VALIDITY OF SURRENDER; IRREGULARITIES _._ All questions as to validity,
form and eligibility of any surrender of Shares and/or Warrants hereunder
will be determined by the Surviving Corporation, and such determination shall
be final and binding. The Surviving Corporation reserves the right to waive
any irregularities or defects in the surrender of any Shares or Warrants, and
its interpretation of the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and of
this Letter of Transmittal (including these Instructions) with respect to such
irregularities or defects shall be final and binding. A surrender of Shares
and/or Warrants will not be deemed to have been made until all irregularities
have been cured or waived. Neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Payment
Agent shall be under any duty to give notification of defects in the
surrender of Shares or Warrants, and they shall not incur any liability for
failure to give such notification.

9. LOST, MUTILATED OR DESTROYED SHARE CERTIFICATES. __ Any surrendering
shareholders whose Certificates have been lost, mutilated or destroyed should
contact the Payment Agent at its address set forth on the cover page hereof
for further instructions.

 



-6-  10\. CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE TO RETURN LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL OR FAILURE TO
SURRENDER STOCK CERTIFICATES OR WARRANTS. __ A check for the payment of the
Shares and/or Warrants will be sent only to persons who deliver this Letter of
Transmittal, properly completed and executed, to the Payment Agent, together
with the Share Certificate(s) and/or Book-Entry Confirmation or Warrant, as
applicable, being submitted therewith and other documents required by this
Letter of Transmittal. The Shares and Warrants are no longer transferable on
the books of the Company. 

11\. SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9. __ To avoid backup withholding, a surrendering
shareholder or Warrant holder who is a U.S. person (as defined for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) is required to provide the Payment Agent with a
correct Taxpayer Identification Number ("TIN") on Substitute Form W-9, which
is provided under "Important Tax Information" below, and to certify, under
penalties of perjury, that such number is correct, such shareholder or Warrant
holder is not subject to backup withholding of U.S. federal income tax, and
such shareholder or Warrant holder is a U.S. person (as defined for U.S.
federal income tax purposes). If a surrendering shareholder or Warrant holder
has been notified by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") that such
shareholder or Warrant holder is subject to backup withholding, such
shareholder or Warrant holder must cross out Item (2) of the Certification box
of the Substitute Form W-9, unless such shareholder or Warrant holder has
since been notified by the IRS that such shareholder or Warrant holder is no
longer subject to backup withholding. Failure to provide the information on
the Substitute Form W-9 may subject the surrendering shareholder to U.S.
federal income tax withholding on the payment of the purchase price with
respect to all Shares and/or Warrants purchased from such shareholder. If the
surrendering shareholder or Warrant holder has not been issued a TIN and has
applied for one or intends to apply for one in the near future, such
shareholder or Warrant holder should check the box in Part 3 of the
Substitute Form W-9, and sign and date the Substitute Form W-9. If the box in
Part 3 is checked and the Payment Agent is not provided with a TIN by the time
of payment, the Payment Agent will withhold a portion of all payments of the
purchase price to such shareholder or Warrant holder until a TIN is provided
to the Payment Agent.

Certain shareholders and Warrant holders (including all corporations and
certain foreign individuals and entities) may not be subject to backup
withholding. Shareholders and Warrant holders that are not U.S. persons (as
defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) should submit an appropriate
and properly completed IRS Form W-8, a copy of which may be obtained from the
IRS website at www.irs.gov, in order to avoid backup withholding. Such
shareholders and Warrant holders should consult a tax advisor to determine
which IRS Form W-8 is appropriate. See the enclosed "Guidelines for
Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9" for
more instructions.

 



-7-  IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION

 

Under U.S. federal income tax law, a shareholder or Warrant holder who is a
U.S. person (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) surrendering
Shares or Warrants, as applicable, must, unless an exemption applies, provide
the Payment Agent (as payer) with the shareholders or Warrant holders, as
applicable, correct TIN on the Substitute Form W-9 included in this Letter of
Transmittal or on IRS Form W-9. If the shareholder or Warrant holder is an
individual, such persons TIN is his or her Social Security number. If the
correct TIN is not provided, the shareholder or Warrant holder may be subject
to a penalty imposed by the IRS, and payments of cash to the shareholder or
Warrant holder (or other payee) may be subject to backup withholding with
respect to a portion of all payments of the purchase price made to such
shareholder or Warrant holder (or other payee).

Certain shareholders and Warrant holders (including corporations and certain
foreign individuals and entities) may not be subject to backup withholding
and reporting requirements. In order for an exempt foreign shareholder or
Warrant holder to avoid backup withholding, such person should complete and
submit an appropriate IRS Form W-8 signed under penalties of perjury,
attesting to such persons exempt status. An IRS Form W-8 can be obtained from
the IRS website at www.irs.gov. Foreign shareholders and Warrant holders
should consult their own tax advisors to determine which IRS Form W-8 is
appropriate in their case. Exempt shareholders and Warrant holders, other than
foreign shareholders and Warrant holders, should furnish their TIN, check the
box in Part 4 of the Substitute Form W-9 and sign, date and return the
Substitute Form W-9 to the Payment Agent in order to avoid backup
withholding. See the enclosed "Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer
Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9" for additional instructions.

 

If backup withholding applies, the Payment Agent is required to withhold and
pay over to the IRS a portion of any payment made to a shareholder or Warrant
holder (or other payee). Backup withholding is not an additional tax, and any
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment of cash to
a shareholder or Warrant holder (or other payee) generally will be allowed as
a refund or credit against the applicable persons U.S. federal income tax
liability, provided that such person timely and properly furnishes the
required information to the IRS.

 

Purpose of Substitute Form W-9

To prevent backup withholding on payments that are made to a shareholder with
respect to Shares surrendered or to a Warrant holder with respect to Warrants
surrendered, the shareholder or Warrant holder, as applicable, is required to
notify the Payment Agent of such shareholders or Warrant holders correct TIN
by completing the Substitute Form W-9 included in this Letter of Transmittal,
certifying (1) that the TIN provided on the Substitute Form W-9 is correct
(or that such shareholder or Warrant holder is awaiting a TIN), (2) that such
shareholder or Warrant holder is not subject to backup withholding because (i)
such shareholder or Warrant holder is exempt from backup withholding, (ii)
such shareholder or Warrant holder has not been notified by the IRS that such
shareholder or Warrant holder is subject to backup withholding as a result of
a failure to report all interest and dividends or (iii) the IRS has notified
such shareholder or Warrant holder that such shareholder or Warrant holder is
no longer subject to backup withholding and (3) such shareholder or Warrant
holder is a U.S. person (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes).

What Number to Give the Payment Agent if You are a U.S. Person

 

The surrendering shareholder or Warrant holder is required to give the Payment
Agent such shareholders or Warrant holders TIN, generally the Social
Security number or Employer Identification Number, of the record holder of the
Shares or Warrants surrendered hereby. If the Shares or Warrants are in more
than one name or are not in the name of the actual owner, consult the
enclosed "Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on
Substitute W-9" for additional guidance on which number to report. If the
surrendering shareholder or Warrant holder has not been issued a TIN and has
applied for a number or intends to apply for a number in the near future,
such shareholder or Warrant holder should check the box in Part 3 of the
Substitute Form W-9, sign and date the Substitute Form W-9 and sign and date
the Certificate of Awaiting Taxpayer Identification Number, which appears in
a separate box below the Substitute Form W-9. If the box in Part 3 of the
Substitute Form W-9 is checked and the Payment Agent is not provided with a
TIN by the time of payment, the Payment Agent will withhold a portion of all
payments of the purchase price until a TIN is provided to the Payment Agent.
If the Payment Agent is provided with an incorrect TIN in connection with such
payments, the shareholder or Warrant holder may be subject to a $50.00
penalty imposed by the IRS.

Exempt payees described above should file a Substitute Form W-9 (or an IRS
Form W-9) to avoid possible erroneous backup withholding. FILE THIS FORM WITH
THE PAYER, FURNISH YOUR TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER, WRITE "EXEMPT" ON THE
FACE OF THE FORM, AND RETURN IT TO THE PAYER. IF THE PAYMENTS ARE INTEREST,
DIVIDENDS, OR PATRONAGE DIVIDENDS, ALSO SIGN AND DATE THE FORM.

Certain payments, other than interest, dividends, and patronage dividends,
that are not subject to information reporting, are also not subject to backup
withholding. For details, see the regulations under sections 6041, 6041A(a),
6045, and 6050A.

PRIVACY ACT NOTICESection 6109 requires most recipients of dividend,
interest, or other payments to give taxpayer identification numbers to payers
who must report the payments to IRS. IRS uses the numbers for identification
purposes. Payers must be given the numbers whether or not recipients are
required to file tax returns. Payers must generally withhold a portion of
taxable interest, dividend, and certain other payments to a payee who does not
furnish a taxpayer identification number to a payer. Certain penalties may
also apply.

PENALTIES

 

(1) PENALTY FOR FAILURE TO FURNISH TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBERIf you fail
to furnish your taxpayer identification number to a payer, you are subject to
a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless your failure is due to
reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.

(2) CIVIL PENALTY FOR FALSE INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO WITHHOLDINGIf you
make a false statement with no reasonable basis which results in no imposition
of backup withholding, you are subject to a penalty of $500.

(3) CRIMINAL PENALTY FOR FALSIFYING INFORMATIONFalsifying certifications
or affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including fines and/or
imprisonment.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONTACT YOUR TAX CONSULTANT OR THE INTERNAL
REVENUE SERVICE.
