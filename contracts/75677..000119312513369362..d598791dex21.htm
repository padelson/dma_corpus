information contained therein or in this Agreement. The inclusion of any information in any section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment by the Company or otherwise imply that such information

the Company Disclosure Schedule to the enforceability of agreements with third parties, the existence or non-existence of third-party rights, the absence of breaches or defaults by third parties or similar matters or statements are intended only to
allocate rights and risks between the Company, Purchaser and Parent and are not intended to be admissions against interests, give rise to any inference or proof of accuracy, be admissible against any Party by any Person who is not a Party or give
rise to any claim or benefit to any Person who is not a Party. In addition, the disclosure of any matter in the Company Disclosure Schedule is not to be deemed an admission that such matter actually constitutes noncompliance with or a violation of
applicable Law, any Order or Governmental Authorization or Contract or other topic to which such disclosure is applicable. In no event shall the disclosure of matters disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule be deemed or interpreted to
constitute or broaden a representation, warranty, obligation, covenant, condition or agreement of the Company except to the extent provided in this Agreement. No reference in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall by itself be construed as an
