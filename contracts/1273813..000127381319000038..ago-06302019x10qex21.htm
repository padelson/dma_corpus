this Agreement) in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Code and
Treasury Regulations thereunder (as finally determined, and subject to any
further amendment, in each case pursuant to this Section 1.3(e), the "Purchase
Price Allocation"). Purchaser shall have the right to review and provide to
the Seller Representative any objections to the Purchase Price Allocation
within thirty (30) days following the receipt of such schedule, in which case
Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall negotiate in good faith and use
reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute. If Purchaser and Seller
Representative fail to resolve such dispute within fifteen (15) days after the
Purchaser timely raised its objections, or such later date as may be agreed,
then Purchaser and Sellers (and their respective Affiliates) may each report
the allocation of the Total Consideration its sole discretion. Any adjustment
to the Total Consideration made pursuant to this Agreement shall be allocated
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.3(e). The parties shall
notify and provide each other with reasonable assistance in the event of an

by it through the date hereof, other than Taxes being disputed in good faith
through appropriate proceedings. The unpaid Taxes of each BlueMountain

Taxes. No claim has ever been made in writing by a Taxing Authority in a
jurisdiction where a BlueMountain Operating Company, a BlueMountain Subsidiary
or a BlueMountain Fund does not file reports or returns that a BlueMountain Operating Company, a BlueMountain Subsidiary or a BlueMountain Fund, as

such audit is contemplated or pending. No extension of time with respect to
any date on which a Tax Return was or is to be filed by the BlueMountain

waiver or agreement by the BlueMountain Operating Companies or the
BlueMountain Subsidiaries is in force for the extension of time for the
assessment or payment of any Taxes.

(d) None of the BlueMountain Operating Companies or the BlueMountain
Subsidiaries has ever been a member of an "affiliated group" (as defined in

Companies or the BlueMountain Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
obligation under, any Tax sharing agreement other than pursuant to a contract
entered into in the ordinary course of business the principal subject matter
of which is not Taxes (a "Commercial Contract"). None of the BlueMountain
Operating Companies or the BlueMountain Subsidiaries has any liability for the
Taxes of any Person under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law) as a transferee or successor or
pursuant to any contractual obligation, other than a Commercial Contract.

(e) No private letter rulings, technical advice memoranda or similar agreement
or rulings have been requested, entered into, or issued by any Taxing
Authority with respect to a BlueMountain Operating Company or a BlueMountain
Subsidiary.

Subsidiaries has been a party to a "reportable transaction" as such term is
defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b) or any other transaction
requiring disclosure under analogous provisions of state, local or foreign Tax
law.

accounting or methods of reporting income or deductions for Tax or accounting

Tax Return or (vi) settled any claim relating to Taxes.

(h) None of the BlueMountain Operating Companies or the BlueMountain
Subsidiaries (or the Purchaser on account of its tax ownership of the
BlueMountain Operating Companies or the BlueMountain Subsidiaries) will be
required to include any item of income in, or exclude any item or deduction
from, taxable income for any taxable period or portion thereof ending after
the Closing Date as a result of: (i) any change in a method of accounting
under Section 481 of the Code (or any comparable provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Laws) for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date;
(ii) an installment sale or open transaction occurring on or prior to the
Closing Date; (iii) any prepaid amount outside the ordinary course of business
received on or prior to the Closing Date; or (v) an election described in
Section 108(i) of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of

applicable U.S. Securities Laws only in certain limited circumstances and the
Parent Common Stock received by such Seller hereunder will bear a customary
legend noting that such securities constitute restricted securities under the
Securities Act.

(d) Such Seller is acquiring the shares of Parent Common Stock solely for his
own account for investment purposes and not with a view to, or for offer or
sale in connection with, any distribution thereof. Such Seller acknowledges
that the shares of Parent Common Stock are not registered under the Securities
Act, or any state Securities Laws, and that the shares of Parent Common Stock
may not be transferred or sold except pursuant to the registration provisions
of the Securities Act or pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom and
subject to state Securities Laws and regulations, as applicable. Such Seller
is an "accredited investor" as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) promulgated
under the Securities Act. Such Seller is able to bear the economic risk of
holding the shares of Parent Common Stock for an indefinite period (including
total loss of its investment), and has sufficient knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits
and risk of its investment.

good faith, in advance of dissemination of such materials to the applicable
recipients thereof (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, ordinary course
communications with the foregoing which do not refer to Purchaser or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement). The foregoing review process
shall not apply to materials that are substantively similar to prior materials
already disseminated to any Client or BlueMountain Fuji CLO (including, where applicable, its Governing Body) or the
partners, shareholders or other investors thereof (as applicable) in
accordance with the foregoing.

to Purchaser and its representatives to the properties, employees, books and
records and Contracts of the BlueMountain Operating Companies and BlueMountain

a bona fide business purpose reasonably related to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Such access shall occur only during normal business hours
upon reasonable advance notice by Purchaser to the BlueMountain Operating
Companies, under the supervision of the BlueMountain Operating Companies'
personnel and shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the operations of the BlueMountain Operating Companies or
BlueMountain Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the obligations contained in this
Section 5.4, the BlueMountain Operating Companies shall not be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would (i) jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of it or its Affiliates (provided that the
BlueMountain Operating Companies shall use their reasonable best efforts to
provide such access or disclosure in a manner and to such extent as would not,
in the reasonable determination of the BlueMountain Operating Companies, give
rise to a colorable claim that such privilege has been waived or is lost as a
result of such access or disclosure) or contravene any applicable Laws and
Regulations, fiduciary duty or Contract (provided that the BlueMountain
Operating Companies shall consider any reasonable alternatives to provide such
information in a manner so as to not result in such contravention) or (ii)

owner, partner, member, director, officer or employee. (b) Subject to Section 5.9(c), for a period of six (6) years from and after
the Closing, Purchaser shall either (i) cause to be maintained in effect the
current policies of directors' and officers' liability, errors and omissions
liability, professional liability, employment practices liability and employee
benefit plan fiduciary liability of the BlueMountain Operating Companies and
BlueMountain Subsidiaries in effect as of the Closing or (ii) provide
substitute polices providing for not less than the existing coverage in effect
as of the Closing and have other terms not less favorable to the insured
persons with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at
or before the Closing (including consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement) in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the
BlueMountain Operating Companies and BlueMountain Subsidiaries' and their
respective current and former owners, partners, members, directors, officers
and employees existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Closing Date.

(c) At the request of Purchaser (and subject to the Purchaser's written

with respect to the current policies of directors' and officers' liability,
errors and omissions liability, professional liability, employment practices
liability and employee benefit plan fiduciary liability insurance of the

premium for such "tail" policy, if applicable, shall be paid by the
BlueMountain Operating Companies in a single lump sum on or prior to the
Closing Date. The Purchaser shall cause the BlueMountain Operating Companies
and BlueMountain Subsidiaries to not amend, cancel or otherwise terminate such
"tail" policy if so obtained by the BlueMountain Operating Companies or
BlueMountain Subsidiaries. In the event that the BlueMountain Operating
Companies purchase the "tail" policy in accordance with this Section 5.9(c),
the obligations of Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.9(b) shall be terminated
and of no further force or effect.

(d) The covenants contained in this Section 5.9 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the parties hereto and each

rights to which such Person is entitled, whether pursuant to law, Contract or
otherwise.

immediately cease any existing activities, discussions and negotiations with
any Persons with respect to any Alternative Proposal and to notify Purchaser
of any Alternative Proposals that such Seller or BlueMountain Operating
Company receives following the date hereof. "Alternative Proposal" for
purposes of this Agreement means any offer or proposal by any Person other
than the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates concerning any (i) merger,
consolidation, other business combination or similar transaction involving the
BlueMountain Operating Companies or the BlueMountain Subsidiaries, (ii) sale,

materially different from the documentation attached as exhibits to Schedule
5.11) and updates on the amount of Restructuring Costs incurred or expected to
be incurred. In connection with the implementation of the Restructuring during
the Interim Period, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, the
BlueMountain Operating Companies shall not take any action that is reasonably
likely to result in the incurrence of Restructuring Costs greater than those
set forth on Schedule 5.11. 5.12 Confidentiality.

(a) Each Seller acknowledges that during the course of its ownership of
interests in the BlueMountain Operating Companies, such Seller has had access
to Confidential Information, as defined herein, of the BlueMountain Operating
Companies and the BlueMountain Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and in
particular, Trade Secrets of the BlueMountain Operating Companies and the
BlueMountain Subsidiaries, as the case may be. For a period of three (3) years
after the Closing, each Seller shall hold in confidence, and not use or
disclose to any Person (other than such Seller's clients, officers and
employees who need to know such information in connection with his or her
normal job function) without written authorization of Purchaser, any
Confidential Information of the BlueMountain Operating Companies or the
BlueMountain Subsidiaries; provided, that such obligations shall be in effect
for a period of five (5) years after the Closing to the extent that the
Confidential Information relates to (i) financial and/or performance
information of the BlueMountain Operating Companies and the BlueMountain
Subsidiaries and (ii) compensation information concerning members or employees
of the BlueMountain Operating Companies and the BlueMountain Subsidiaries.
"Confidential Information" means, with respect to any Seller, any proprietary
and non-public information, technical data, Trade Secrets or know-how of any
BlueMountain Operating Company and any BlueMountain Subsidiary, including, but
not limited to, proprietary research, technical services, products, services,
pricing, techniques, operating systems, client lists, leads, customer lists
and confidential information regarding clients, customers and suppliers, non-
public terms of agreements with clients, customers or suppliers, proprietary
processes, markets, software, developments, inventions, processes, formulas,
technology, designs, drawings, engineering, hardware configuration
information, marketing, finances or other business information, in each case,
disclosed to such Seller by any BlueMountain Operating Company or BlueMountain
Subsidiary either directly or indirectly in writing. Confidential Information
with respect to the applicable Seller does not include any of the foregoing
items which (A) are or become generally known in the industry and not specific
to the BlueMountain Operating Companies and the BlueMountain Subsidiaries or
are or become generally known by or available to the public through no breach
of this Agreement by such Seller, (B) are or become available to such Seller
on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the BlueMountain

knowledge, is not bound by a confidentiality obligation to the BlueMountain
Operating Companies and the BlueMountain Subsidiaries with respect to such
items or (C) have been or are independently developed by such Seller without
use of, or reference to, Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the restrictions in this Section 5.12(a) shall not apply to the
disclosure of any Confidential Information (x) as required by any Laws and
Regulations or rules of any stock exchange or any Order from any Governmental
Authority or legal process or as required or requested to be made available to
any Governmental Authority or any of its Affiliates or (y) in connection with any actual or threatened dispute, proceeding or
action related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided that in the case of clause (x), to the extent legally permissible,
such Seller gives Purchaser prior written notice of any such disclosure and
cooperates with Purchaser, at the sole cost of Purchaser, in a reasonable
manner to protect the confidentiality of such information to the fullest
extent possible.

(b) Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that (i) Purchaser and its Affiliates
would suffer irreparable harm in the event that any provision of Section
5.12(a) were not performed in accordance with its terms or otherwise were
breached; and (ii) monetary damages, even if available, alone may not be an
adequate remedy for any such non-performance or breach. Accordingly, each
Seller agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of any
provision of Section 5.12(a), Purchaser shall be entitled, in addition to all
other rights and remedies that it may have existing in its favor at law, in
equity or otherwise, to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, including
a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction and a final
injunction, to prevent any such breach or threatened breach and to enforce
such provisions specifically, without the necessity of posting a bond or other
security or of proving actual damages.

Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect
until the Closing Date (and shall pay all premiums due thereon), the insurance
policies and fidelity bonds listed on Schedule 2.16, or use their reasonable
best efforts to procure comparable replacement policies and bonds (or such
replacement coverage as is obtainable) and maintain such policies and bonds in
effect until the Closing.

to terminate the BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC 401(k) Plan (the
"Savings Plan"), Purchaser shall provide written notice to such effect to the

prior to the Closing Date, and the BlueMountain Operating Companies shall
adopt, prior to the Closing, resolutions to terminate the Savings Plan
effective as of immediately prior to the Closing.

Insurance Policy provides that the insurer providing the same shall have no
right of subrogation against the Seller Representative, any Seller, or their
respective Affiliates, except in the case of Fraud. Purchaser shall not: (a)
permit the RandW Insurance Policy to be amended, supplemented, or otherwise
modified, and shall not grant any waiver or consent thereunder, in each case
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to be adverse to the Seller
Representative, any Seller or their respective Affiliates; (b) cancel the RandW
Insurance Policy or permit it to lapse; or (c) take action that would reasonably be expected to
cause the RandW Insurance Policy to lapse or to be rescinded or canceled.

Management Company LLC not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the BlueMountain Operating Companies and the BlueMountain

SECTION 6.

|

CERTAIN TAX MATTERS 

6.1 Tax Treatment. The parties hereto agree that the purchase and sale of the
BlueMountain Interests pursuant to this Agreement shall each be treated, for
all U.S. federal and corresponding state and local income Tax purposes, as a
taxable sale governed by IRS Revenue Ruling 99-6, Situation 2 and that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will result in a termination of
each BlueMountain Operating Company as a partnership under Section 708(b)(1)
of the Code, which termination shall close the taxable year of each such
entity as of the Closing Date. None of the Parties shall take any position
(whether in audits, on any Tax Returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent with
the treatment described in this Section 6.1 except as required by a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

6.2 Tax Indemnification. Following the Closing, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Section 6, the Principal agrees to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against Indemnified
Taxes; provided, however, that the Principal shall not be required to
indemnify Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.2 for any amounts to the extent
attributable to any Taxes arising out of or resulting from any transaction or
action taken or caused by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates outside the
ordinary course of business on the Closing Date after the Closing or any
Transfer Taxes for which Purchaser is responsible pursuant to Section 1.6.

6.3 Tax Returns.

(a) The Seller Representative shall timely prepare and file (or cause to be
timely prepared and filed) (i) IRS Form 1065 and all comparable state and
local partnership information Tax Returns for each of the BlueMountain Operating Companies for
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and (ii) all other Tax
Returns of the BlueMountain Operating Companies and BlueMountain Subsidiaries
for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date (collectively,
"BlueMountain Tax Returns"). All BlueMountain Tax Returns shall be prepared
and filed in a manner consistent with past practice, provided that any tax
deductions attributable to expenses borne directly or indirectly by Sellers or
any BlueMountain Operating Company or any BlueMountain Subsidiary in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
attributed to the taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on the Closing
Date and shall be allocated to the Sellers to the maximum extent permitted by
law.

(b) Without the prior written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the BlueMountain Sellers shall
not make, change or rescind any Tax election of a BlueMountain Operating
Company or a BlueMountain Subsidiary, amend any Tax Return of a BlueMountain
Operating Company or a BlueMountain Subsidiary or take any position on any Tax
Return of a BlueMountain Operating Company or a BlueMountain Subsidiary, in
each case to the extent such action would have the effect of increasing the
Tax liability or reducing any Tax asset of Purchaser, a BlueMountain Operating
Company or a BlueMountain Subsidiary in respect of any Post-Closing Tax
Period.

(c) Purchaser shall timely prepare and file (or cause to be timely prepared
and filed) all Tax Returns of the BlueMountain Operating Companies and
BlueMountain Subsidiaries not described in Section 6.3(a) (each, a "Purchaser
Tax Return"); provided that, not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due
date (including extensions) of any such Purchaser Tax Return for a Straddle
Period, Purchaser shall submit a draft of such Purchaser Tax Return, together
with all material supporting documentation and work papers to the Seller
Representative and the AMG Seller for their comment and approval. The Seller
Representative or the AMG Seller shall, no later than fifteen (15) days
following receipt of each such Purchaser Tax Return, provide written notice
(the "Tax Dispute Notice") to Purchaser of any items in such Purchaser Tax
Returns that the Seller Representative or the AMG Seller (as applicable)
disputes in good faith including the reasons for such dispute. During the
thirty (30) day period following delivery of a Tax Dispute Notice, Purchaser
and the Seller Representative and the AMG Seller shall negotiate in good faith
with a view to resolving their disagreements over the disputed items. If the
parties fail to resolve their differences over the disputed items within such
thirty (30) day period, then Purchaser, the Seller Representative and the AMG
Seller shall forthwith jointly request that the Accounting Firm make a binding
determination as to the disputed items in accordance with this Agreement. If
any dispute with respect to a Purchaser Tax Return is not resolved prior to
the applicable filing due date (including extensions), such Purchaser Tax
Return shall be filed in the manner requested by Seller Representative and the
AMG Seller; provided that such Purchaser Tax Return shall subsequently be
amended to reflect the determination of the Accounting Firm. The costs of the
Accounting Firm with respect to such determination shall be borne equally by the Sellers (pro rata based on
each Seller's Sale Percentage), on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other
hand.

(d) Without the prior written consent of the Seller Representative and the AMG
Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to
take any of the following actions with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
a Straddle Period of any BlueMountain Operating Company or BlueMountain
Subsidiary (i) file, re-file or amend any Tax Return; (ii) enter into
discussions regarding any voluntary disclosure involving Taxes; (iii) change
any method or period of accounting; (iv) enter into any closing agreement or
settle any Tax claim or assessment; (v) extend or waive the limitation period
applicable to any Tax claim or assessment; (vi) surrender any right to claim a
refund of Taxes; (vii) make or change any Tax election (including under Code
Section 6226 or any comparable applicable provisions of state, local, or
foreign Tax law); or (viii) take any other similar action, or omit to take any
action, relating to the filing of any Tax Return or the payment of any Tax.

6.4 Apportionment. For all purposes under this Agreement, in the case of any
real property, personal property, ad valorem or other Taxes that are imposed
on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such
Tax which relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire Straddle Period. Any such Taxes that are not
allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be allocated to the Post-Closing
Tax Period. In the case of any other Taxes for a Straddle Period, the
allocation of such Taxes between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-
Closing Tax Period shall be made on the basis of an interim closing of the
books as of close of business on the Closing Date. If any such Taxes shall
thereafter be reduced by abatement, the amount of such abatement, less the
reasonable cost of obtaining the same, shall be apportioned as described
above.

6.5 Tax Contests.

(a) Purchaser shall notify the Seller Representative and the AMG Seller within
five (5) days after receipt by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates of written
notice of any pending federal, state, local or foreign Tax audit or
examination or notice of deficiency or other adjustment, assessment or
redetermination (each a "Tax Proceeding") relating to any BlueMountain Tax
Return (each, a "Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding").

(b) The Seller Representative and the AMG Seller shall have the sole right, at
Sellers' expense and with counsel of their choosing, to control, contest,
resolve, and defend against any Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding. In the event of any such Pre-
Closing Tax Proceeding, Purchaser and Sellers shall cause Seller
Representative and the AMG Seller to be designated as (i) the "partnership
representative" of each BlueMountain Operating Company for each taxable period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, in accordance with Section 6223 of the
Code and any similar provision under any state or local or non-U.S. tax laws,
and (ii) the "tax matters partner" of each BlueMountain Operating Company, in
accordance with Section 6231 of the Code as in effect before the enactment of
the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, and any similar provision under any state
or local or non-U.S. tax laws, for any such period, as applicable.

(c) Purchaser shall have the sole right at its own expense and with counsel of
its choosing to control all Tax Proceedings of any BlueMountain Operating
Company or BlueMountain Subsidiary other than any Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding
with respect to which Seller Representative or the AMG Seller has exercised
its control rights pursuant to Section 6.5(a); provided that, with respect to
any such Tax Proceeding in respect of which any Seller could be liable or the
Principal could be obligated to indemnify Purchaser under Section 6.2, (i)
Purchaser shall offer Seller Representative and the AMG Seller a reasonable
opportunity to comment before submitting to any Taxing Authority any written
materials prepared or furnished in connection with such Tax Proceeding, and
allow Seller Representative and the AMG Seller to participate at their own
expense in any related meeting or telephonic conference with the applicable
Taxing Authority and (ii) Purchaser shall keep Seller Representative and the
AMG Seller reasonably apprised of such Tax Proceeding.

(d) Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates to, concede,
settle, or compromise any Tax Proceeding (or portion thereof) controlled by
Purchaser under Section 6.5(c) without the prior written consent of Seller
Representative and the AMG Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; it being understood and agreed that Seller
Representative's or the AMG Seller's withholding of consent shall not be
deemed to be unreasonable to the extent such concession, settlement, or
compromise would reasonably be expected to adversely affect Sellers or their
respective Affiliates.

6.6 Refunds. Any refunds (or credits in lieu thereof) of Taxes (net of any (i)
Taxes imposed on Purchaser or any BlueMountain Operating Company or any
BlueMountain Subsidiary as a result of the receipt of such refund and (ii) any
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Purchaser or any BlueMountain

and against any damages, liabilities, losses, Taxes, judgments, awards, fines,
penalties, claims, costs, and expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and experts) (whether or not arising
out of third-party claims) (collectively, "Losses") incurred by any of them
resulting from, arising out of or based upon any of the following matters:

(a) any breach of any Seller Fundamental Representations set forth in Section
2 of this Agreement and any breach of the representations of the BlueMountain
Operating Companies set forth in Section 2.8, in each case solely to the
extent that such Losses cannot be recovered by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties under the RandW Insurance Policy either (i) as a result of the
application of the then-applicable Deductible under the RandW Insurance Policy
to all or a portion of such Losses or (ii) because the Cap under the RandW
Insurance Policy has been exhausted;

(b) any breach of covenant or agreement of the BlueMountain Operating
Companies in this Agreement;

(c) any claim that the payees, or the amount or calculation, of the payments

applicable Deductible under the RandW Insurance Policy to all or a portion of
such Losses or (ii) because the Cap under the RandW Insurance Policy has been
exhausted;

(b) any breach of covenant or agreement of such Seller in this Agreement; and

(c) any Leakage Amount of any member(s) of such Seller's Locked Box Group;
provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that no Seller shall have any liability

respect to any claim asserted pursuant to Section 9.2 or Section 9.3, as
applicable, after the expiration of the related representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 (the "Indemnification Cut-Off

case of the AMG Seller, any breach of any covenant or agreement of any

or (C) any Fraud of any other Seller (and, in the case of the AMG Seller, any
Fraud of any BlueMountain Operating Company or BlueMountain Subsidiary, in

Fraud of any other Seller or any BlueMountain Operating Company or
BlueMountain Subsidiary and (y) no Seller shall have any obligation to
contribute to or otherwise fund any portion of the indemnification obligation
of any other Seller under this Agreement (whether under the Organizational
Documents of the BlueMountain Operating Companies or the BlueMountain
Subsidiaries or otherwise).

9.5 Indemnification by Purchaser. From and after the Closing, subject to the
terms of this Section 9, Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold the Sellers
and their respective Affiliates and their officers, directors, members,

Party" and, collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") harmless from and
against any Losses by any of them resulting from, arising out of or based upon

Parent set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement; or

(b) any breach of covenant or agreement of Purchaser or Purchaser Parent under
this Agreement.

provision of this Agreement to the contrary, other than in the case of Fraud,
the right of Seller Indemnified Parties to indemnification under Section 9.5
shall be subject to the following provisions:

(a) No indemnification pursuant to Section 9.5(a) shall be payable to the
Seller Indemnified Parties, and Purchaser shall not be liable for any Losses
thereunder, unless the total of all Losses for which indemnification would
otherwise be payable pursuant to Section 9.5(a) shall exceed the then-
applicable Deductible, in which case Purchaser shall only be liable for such
Losses in excess of such amount; provided that in no event shall the
limitation provided in this Section 9.6(a) apply to any claim based upon or
related to a breach of any Purchaser Fundamental Representation; (b) No indemnification shall be payable to any Seller Indemnified Party with
respect to claims asserted pursuant to Section 9.5 above after the applicable

Section 9.7 prior to the applicable Indemnification Cut-Off Date; and

(c) No indemnification shall be payable to the Seller Indemnified Parties for
Losses arising under or related to any claims asserted under Section 9.5(a) in
amounts in the aggregate in excess of the Cap; provided that in no event shall
the limitation provided in this Section 9.6(c) apply to any claim based upon a
breach of any Purchaser Fundamental Representation.

9.7 Notice; Defense of Claims.

(a) An indemnified party may make a claim for indemnification under this
Section 9 by giving written notice thereof to Purchaser (if it is the
indemnifying party), the Principal (if he is the indemnifying party) or the
Seller Representative and the AMG Seller (if any Seller other than the
Principal is an indemnifying party) prior to the applicable Indemnification
Cut-Off Date. Promptly after the Person seeking indemnification pursuant to
this Section 9 (the "Indemnified Party") has knowledge of any claim of a third
party that would reasonably be expected to give rise to indemnification under
this Section 9 (a "Third-Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall deliver to
the Person from which indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party")
(and, where the Indemnifying Party is a Seller other than the Principal, to
the Seller Representative and the AMG Seller), written notice thereof pursuant
to the preceding sentence promptly after it obtains such knowledge, provided
that the failure to give such written notice shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any liability except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced as a result of such failure to
give notice. Each notice under this Section 9.7 shall reasonably summarize (i)
the bases for the claim for indemnification and any claim or liability being
asserted by a third party, (ii) the representation and warranty or covenant or
other agreement that is alleged to have been inaccurate or to have been
breached, and (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable or estimable, an
estimate of, the aggregate amount of the Losses for which a claim is being
made under this Section 9.

(b) After receipt by Purchaser (where it is the Indemnifying Party), the
Principal (where he is the Indemnifying Party) or the Seller Representative
and the AMG Seller (where any Seller other than the Principal is the
Indemnifying Party) of a claim notice under Section 9.7(a) with respect to a
Third-Party Claim, Purchaser (where it is the Indemnifying Party), the
Principal (where he is the Indemnifying Party), the AMG Seller (where it is an
Indemnifying Party) or the Seller Representative (where a Seller other than
the Principal and the AMG Seller is an Indemnifying Party), as applicable, may, at its option, upon
written notice given to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of the
receipt of the notice of such Third-Party Claim, assume the defense of the
Indemnified Party against such claim (including the employment of counsel of
its choosing), provided, however, if (A) any portion of such Third-Party Claim
seeks injunctive, equitable or other non-monetary relief against any
Indemnified Party or (B) any portion of such Third-Party Claim involves
criminal or quasi-criminal allegations against any Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to control such portion of such Third-
Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate in the
compromise of, or defense against, such Third-Party Claim. Except with the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, no Indemnifying Party (or the Seller
Representative on behalf of any BlueMountain Seller) shall settle or
compromise any Third-Party Claim or permit a default judgment or consent to an
entry of judgment unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) provides
solely for the payment of money damages, (ii) provides for a full release of
the Indemnified Party to the extent that there is an Indemnified Party
defendant with respect to the claim(s) being settled, (iii) does not contain
any admission or finding of wrongdoing on behalf of the Indemnified Party, and
(iv) does not require such Indemnified Party to pay any portion of the
settlement. Until the Indemnifying Party or the Seller Representative, as
applicable, shall have so assumed the defense of any Third-Party Claim in
accordance with the terms of this Section 9.7(b), the Indemnified Party may,
but shall not be obligated to, undertake the defense of such claim on behalf
of and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Party, and if such
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this Section 9, all
reasonable legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by the Indemnified
Party shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party. In the event that an
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim in
accordance with the terms of this Section 9.7(b), any Indemnified Party shall
have the right to employ one separate counsel (other than local counsel) in
any such action or claim and to participate in (but not control) the defense
thereof (A) at its own expense or (B) at the Indemnifying Party's sole cost
and expense if (x) the employment of such counsel has been specifically
authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party, (y) in the reasonable opinion
of counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict or potential conflict exists
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such
separate representation advisable or (z) one or more defenses are available to
the Indemnified Party that are not available to the Indemnifying Party. No
Indemnifying Party shall be liable to indemnify any Indemnified Party for any
consent to an entry of any judgment or any compromise or settlement of any
such action or claim effected without the consent of the Indemnifying Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). After any
Third-Party Claim has been filed or initiated, subject to applicable Laws and
Regulations and all privileges, including the attorney-client privilege, each
party shall make available to the other parties and their attorneys and
accountants all pertinent information under its control relating to such claim, and the parties agree to render to each other such assistance as
they may reasonably require of each other in order to facilitate the proper
and adequate defense of any such claim.

(c) For all purposes of this Section 9, in the case when the Indemnifying
Party with respect to any particular claim includes both the AMG Seller and
one or more other Sellers, (i) all notices required to be given to or made by,
and all consents and other actions to be taken by, the Indemnifying Party
shall be given to or made by or taken by the AMG Seller and the Seller
Representative and all references to the "Indemnifying Party" shall be deemed
to be references to the AMG Seller and the Seller Representative, (ii) the AMG
Seller shall be entitled to control the defense and conduct of any Third-Party
Claim and related proceeding or portion thereof to the extent related to the
AMG Seller or one of its Affiliates (including by employing counsel of its
choosing) and (iii) in no event shall the AMG Seller be liable for any action
(including any settlement) taken without its prior written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

9.8 Other Indemnification Matters.

(a) In calculating any amount indemnifiable hereunder in respect of Losses,
Losses shall be reduced by any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified
Party under available insurance policies, pursuant to indemnification
obligations, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses
(including, in the case of any claims made by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties, any recovery pursuant to the terms of the RandW Insurance Policy), net
of (i) any increase in related premiums based on retrospective or
reinstatement premium adjustments or other similar adjustments, (ii) any
deductible and (iii) any other reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expense
incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining such recovery. If an
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates receive any such recovery described in the
immediately preceding sentence after an indemnification payment by the
Indemnifying Party has been made, then such Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment
made, but not in excess of such amount received by the Indemnified Party or

use commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery under any available
third-party insurance policies or third-party indemnification obligations or
other rights of recovery with respect to such Losses.

(b) The parties agree to treat any indemnity payment made under this Agreement

(within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar state or
local tax provision)). (c) Any liability for any Loss shall be determined without duplication of
recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such Loss constituting
a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of
this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for purposes
of (i) determining whether there has been a breach or inaccuracy giving rise

amount of Losses resulting from any breach or inaccuracy of a representation
or warranty in this Agreement, all "material," "materially," "in all material
respects," "Material Adverse Effect" and other like qualifications shall be
disregarded.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, the right of
any party hereto to seek indemnification and to payment of Losses pursuant to
this Section 9 shall not be affected in any way by any investigation conducted
(or omitted), or any knowledge (whether actual, constructive or imputed)
acquired (or capable of being acquired), by such party hereto at any time with
respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with or performance of
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation. The waiver,
other than a written waiver, of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or obligation, shall not affect the right to indemnification based on
such representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and obligations.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, Section 9.3(c)
shall be the sole and exclusive provision in this Agreement under which the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to make any claim or recover
any Losses resulting from, arising out of or based upon any matter
constituting Leakage, and no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
any recovery under this Agreement in respect of Leakage under Section 9.2(a)

representation or warranty in this Agreement) or any other provision of this
Section 9.

accordance with Section 1.3(c)) on its own behalf, to insure Purchaser after
the Closing against Losses arising out of or in connection with breaches of
any of the representations and warranties in Section 2 and Section 3 and such
other Losses covered under the terms of the RandW Insurance Policy and (ii) for
purposes of clarity, as between any Purchaser Indemnified Party, on the one
hand, and the insurer under the RandW Insurance Policy, on the other hand, none
of the terms, limitations, conditions and restrictions on indemnification set forth in this Section 9
shall affect the rights of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under the RandW
Insurance Policy, which rights shall be governed solely thereby.

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, other than as provided in
Section 9.2(a) and Section 9.3(a), the sole and exclusive recourse of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any breach or inaccuracy of any
representations and warranties in this Agreement shall be the RandW Insurance
Policy and any recovery for any Losses related thereto shall be satisfied only
under the RandW Insurance Policy. Other than any indemnification for Losses for
which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification
directly from the applicable Seller(s) pursuant to Section 9.2(a) or Section
9.3(a), no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall have any right to seek or recover
any amounts from any Seller resulting from, arising out of or relating to any
breach or inaccuracy of any representations and warranties in this Agreement.

9.10 Exclusive Remedy. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that, from
and after the Closing, except for the right to seek and obtain equitable
relief pursuant to Section 5.12(b) or Section 12.11 or to seek any remedy in
respect of Fraud, such party's sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
and all claims for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement shall be pursuant to the provisions set forth in this
Section 9. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby waives,
from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable

forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
that such party may have against the other parties hereto, such other parties'
Affiliates and each of their respective representatives arising under or based
upon any applicable Law or Regulation, in each case except pursuant to the
provisions set forth in this Section 9. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 9.10, nothing in this Section 9.10 shall limit the
right of any party hereto to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any
such party hereto shall be entitled pursuant to Section 5.12(b) or Section
12.11 or to seek any remedy on account of Fraud by any party hereto.

9.11 Assignment of Claims. With respect to any matter giving rise to a claim
for indemnification hereunder, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to,
and the Indemnified Party shall assign to the Indemnifying Party, any right of
action (whether pursuant to contract, arising under applicable law or
otherwise) which the Indemnified Party may have against any other Person other
than any such right of action against a BlueMountain Operating Company or a
BlueMountain Subsidiary; provided, that no such subrogation or assignment
shall contravene the terms of the RandW Insurance Policy. |

following delivery of written notice from the Seller Representative and the

or fails to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or

Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and

12.7 Captions; Gender; Interpretation. The captions in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of
any term or provision hereof. The use in this Agreement of the masculine
pronoun in reference to a party hereto shall be deemed to include the feminine
or neuter, as the context may require. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." Any document, list or other
item shall be deemed to have been "made available" to Purchaser for all
purposes of this Agreement only if such document, list or other item was
posted at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date hereof in the
electronic dataroom established by the Sellers in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All terms defined in this
Agreement in the singular have a comparable meaning when used in the plural,
and vice versa. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event any ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by all parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement. References to any Person
include the successors and permitted assigns of that Person.

12.8 Execution in Counterparts. For the convenience of the parties and to
facilitate execution, this Agreement may be (i) executed in counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one
and the same document, and (ii) executed by facsimile.

12.9 Amendments. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except by a
writing duly and validly executed by (i) Purchaser, (ii) the AMG Seller and
(iii) the Seller Representative (on his own behalf and on behalf of each of
the BlueMountain Sellers and the BlueMountain Operating Companies, and the
Seller Representative shall be authorized to so amend this Agreement on behalf
of each of them), and compliance with any provisions set forth in this
Agreement may not be waived except by a writing duly and validly executed by
the party waiving compliance.

12.10 Publicity and Disclosures. Purchaser, the AMG Seller and the Seller
Representative shall coordinate with each other in advance as to the form and
content of any press release or other external written communication to be
disseminated to members of the public regarding the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. No press releases or public disclosure, either written or oral, of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be made by a party to this Agreement without the prior written
consent of Purchaser, the AMG Seller and the Seller Representative (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as is otherwise required
by applicable Laws and Regulations or pursuant to any listing agreement with
or rules of any national securities exchange or by the request of any
Governmental Authority (in which case, to the extent possible under the
circumstances and permitted by applicable Laws or Regulations, the party
making such disclosure shall provide prior notice to the other parties
described in this Section 12.10).

12.11 Specific Performance.

(a) The parties agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed by the parties hereto in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached thereby at or prior to the Closing, irreparable damage
would occur, no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would not be
able to be determined, and that each of Purchaser, the AMG Seller and the
Seller Representative (acting on behalf of the BlueMountain Sellers), but no
other party hereto, will be entitled to specific performance at or prior to
the Closing to prevent such breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any
other remedy to which it may be entitled at law or in equity.

(b) Each of the parties agrees that (i) it is their intention that each of
Purchaser, the AMG Seller and the Seller Representative (on behalf of the
BlueMountain Sellers) be able to obtain specific performance to specifically
enforce the provisions of this Agreement, and no party will take any different
or conflicting position in any legal, administrative, arbitral or other
proceedings, suits or actions and (ii) it will not oppose the granting of, or
raise any objections to the availability or granting of, the equitable remedy
of specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that (x) the
other party has an adequate remedy at law (including monetary damages) or (y)
an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or equity. No party hereto shall be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any order or injunction to prevent breaches
of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement.

12.12 Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

Agreement or any Transaction Document and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby shall be brought in a state court located in the borough of
Manhattan in New York, New York or a federal court located in the borough of
Manhattan in New York, New York. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably consents
to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws and
Regulations, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of
the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any
such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party hereto anywhere in the world, whether within or without
the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
hereto agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section
12.4 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTION
DOCUMENTS, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY
HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY HERETO UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY HERETO MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HERETO HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 12.12(B).

12.13 No Recourse. Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or
related to this Agreement may only be brought against Persons that are
expressly named as parties hereto and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to such party. Subject to the
immediately preceding sentence, no former, current or future direct or
indirect equity holders, controlling Persons, stockholders, directors,

have any liability or obligation for any of the representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements, obligations or liabilities of the BlueMountain

strict liability or otherwise, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any applicable Laws and Regulations or otherwise and whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate or partnership veil, by or through

limited, impaired, discharged, deferred, suspended or terminated by any
proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the bankruptcy, insolvency,

decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such
proceeding. The Guaranteed Parties shall not be obligated to file any claim

proceeding, and the failure of any Guaranteed Party to so file shall not
affect the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder. AMG Parent shall not institute
any proceeding asserting or assert as a defense in any proceeding, and shall
cause its respective Affiliates not to institute any proceeding asserting or
assert a defense in any proceeding, that this guarantee is illegal, invalid or

guarantee, presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance,
default, dishonor and protest, notice of any Guaranteed Obligations incurred,

Obligations, notice of or proof of reliance by Purchaser upon guarantee, any
right to require the marshalling of assets of the AMG Seller and all
suretyship defenses generally.

power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform the
obligations under this Section 12.17, and the execution, delivery and
performance under this Section 12.17 of this Agreement by AMG Parent has been
duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of AMG Parent; (ii) this
Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of AMG Parent
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be
restricted, limited or delayed by applicable bankruptcy or similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally; and (iii) the execution, delivery and
performance under this Section 12.17 by AMG Parent does not contravene any
provision of AMG Parent's Organizational Documents or any Laws and Regulations
or contractual restriction binding on AMG Parent or any of its assets.
