thereto, at the Effective Time all of the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



17 2.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

 

(a) _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, subject to the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.13_, the certificate of incorporation of the
Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as set forth on

become the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware
Law and such certificate of incorporation.

 

(b) _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of _Section_ __
_ 6.13_, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the

Law, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such
bylaws.

2.6 _Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) _Directors_. At the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

 

(b) _Officers_. At the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective

2.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_ _._

 

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders of
any of the following securities, the following shall occur:

 

(i) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (A) Cancelled
Shares, (B) Dissenting Shares and (C) Unvested Restricted Stock) shall be
canceled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration, without interest
thereon, upon the surrender of (A) certificates representing shares of Company
Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") and (B) uncertificated shares of Company
Common Stock (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ ") in the manner provided in
_Section_ __ _ 2.8_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the
manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.10_).

 

(ii) _Owned Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock owned by
Parent, the Company, or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent or the Company (the " _Cancelled Shares_ "), in each case immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.

 



18 (iii) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one (1) validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation, and shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate
evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub shall
thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. If, during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of Company Capital Stock shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend with a record date during such period (but, for clarity, excluding
any change that results from any exercise of options, the payment of
restricted share units, performance share units or similar awards, or as a
result of the grant of new options, restricted share units, performance share
units or similar awards by the Company), the Merger Consideration and any
other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately
adjusted.

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and held by a holder who has
not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in
writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares being referred to
collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights
under Delaware Law with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a
right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to
payment of the appraised value of such shares in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL; _provided_ that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails
to perfect, withdraws or loses such holders right to appraisal, pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section
262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated as if
they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.7(a)(i)_, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing
such share or transfer of such Uncertificated Share, as the case may be.

 

(ii) The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, any
withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument
delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Delaware Law
that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right
to participate in and direct all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with
respect to such demands; _provided, that,_ all costs incurred by Parent in
connection with such participation in and direction of such Legal Proceedings
shall be borne exclusively by Parent. Except with the prior written consent
of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to
settle or settle, any such demands.

 



19 (d) _Company Compensatory Awards_.

 

(i) _Unvested Company Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each
award of Company Restricted Stock Units (or portion thereof) that is
outstanding and unsettled immediately prior to the Effective Time, to the
extent then unvested (after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting
pursuant to the terms of the award in connection with the Merger), shall, by
virtue of the Merger, be assumed by Parent (each, an " _Assumed RSU_ "). The
number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Assumed RSU shall be
equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying such unvested Company Restricted Stock Unit award as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio (with the resulting number, rounded down to the nearest whole
share). Such Assumed RSUs will otherwise be subject to the same terms and
conditions as applied to the related award of Company Restricted Stock Units
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the same vesting schedule
and any accelerated vesting provisions applicable thereto. 

(ii) _Vested Company Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each
award of Company Restricted Stock Units (or portion thereof) that is
outstanding and unsettled immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is
then vested or will vest pursuant to its terms in connection with the Merger
shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the
vested portion of the Company Restricted Stock Unit award immediately prior to
the Effective Time (after giving effect to any accelerated vesting that may be
required in connection with the Merger under the terms of the award)
multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration (the " _RSU Consideration_ ").

 

(iii) _Company Performance Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each award of
Company Performance Stock Units (or portion thereof) that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest as to a percentage of the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such award to be
determined prior to the Closing by the Compensation Committee of the Company
Board (which percentage, for purposes of clarity, may be greater than 100%
but in no event will be less than 100% or greater than the maximum possible
vesting percentage under the terms of the award) and shall be canceled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (x) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the vested portion of the Company
Performance Stock Unit award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(after giving effect to the foregoing determination of the Compensation
Committee and any other accelerated vesting that may be required in connection
with the Merger under the terms of the award) multiplied by (y) the Merger
Consideration (the " _PSU Consideration_ ").

 



20 (iv) _Company Options and Company Stock Appreciation Rights_. At the Effective
Time, each Company Option and Company Stock Appreciation Right (or portion
thereof) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by Parent (each, individually an
" _Assumed Option_ " or " _Assumed SAR_ "). Each such Assumed Option or
Assumed SAR shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to
the related Company Option or Company Stock Appreciation Right immediately
prior to the Effective Time, including the vesting schedule and any
accelerated vesting provisions applicable thereto, except that (A) the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Assumed Option or Assumed SAR
shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock underlying such Assumed Option or Assumed SAR as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio (with the
resulting number rounded down to the nearest whole share), and (B) the per
share exercise price of each Assumed Option or Assumed SAR shall be equal to
the quotient determined by dividing (x) the exercise price per share at which
such Assumed Option or Assumed SAR was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio (with the resulting
price per share rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Each Assumed Option so
assumed by Parent shall qualify following the Effective Time as an incentive
stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent permitted
under Section 422 of the Code and to the extent such Assumed Option qualified
as an incentive stock option prior to the Effective Time, and, further, that
the assumption of Assumed Options or Assumed SARs pursuant to this Section
shall be effected in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Sections 409A
and 424(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder,
and this _Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)(iv)_ will be construed consistent with this
intent.

(v) _Restricted Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is
outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time and is
subject to a restricted stock award agreement, (" _Unvested Restricted Stock_
"), shall be canceled and extinguished at the Effective Time and
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.7(a)(i)_; _provided,
however_ , that the right of the holder of such Unvested Restricted Stock to
receive such cash payment shall be subject to the same vesting conditions
(including any applicable acceleration provisions provided under the terms of
the award) as applied to the share of Company Common Stock to which such
payment of the Merger Consideration relates (and, if and to the extent such
vesting conditions are not satisfied, the holder will not be entitled to such
payment of the Merger Consideration). Any Merger Consideration payable
with respect to the Unvested Restricted Stock pursuant to the terms hereof
shall be paid on or reasonably promptly after (and in all events within
fifteen (15) Business Days (or, as to Unvested Restricted Stock held by a
Person employed by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries outside of the
United States, thirty (30) Business Days) after) the applicable vesting date.

(vi)  _Non-US Company Compensatory Awards._ Notwithstanding the provisions
above, Parent and the Company may, prior to the Effective Time, agree that
any Company Compensatory Award that is subject to the Applicable Laws of a
non-U.S. jurisdiction may be treated in a manner other than as prescribed by
this _Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)_, as applicable, to the extent that (i) Parent
and the Company reasonably and in good faith determine that (A) the manner in
which such Company Compensatory Award would otherwise be treated pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)_ would result in a violation of Applicable Laws
or a materially adverse tax consequence to the individual holding such Company
Compensatory Award in the applicable

 



21  non-U.S. jurisdiction and (B) such different treatment is necessary to
comply with such Applicable Laws and (ii) such different treatment is, to the
maximum extent practicable, consistent with the applicable provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)_. Parent and the Company shall agree at least ten (10)
days prior to the Effective Time to the treatment of any Company Compensatory
Award that will be treated in a manner other than as prescribed by this
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)_.

(vii)  _Resolutions; Form S-8_. The Company shall adopt resolutions of the
Company Board or a committee thereof to provide for the treatment of the
Company Compensatory Awards as contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)_.
Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than fifteen (15)
Business Days following the Effective Time), if available for use by Parent,
Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form
S-8 (or other appropriate form) relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable with respect to assumed or converted Company Compensatory Awards
under this  _Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)_. Parent shall take all actions necessary
to effect the transactions contemplated by, and in accordance with, this
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)_, including issuing, effective as of the
Effective Time, the Assumed RSUs, Assumed Options and Assumed SARs.

(e) Special Shares. The Series A-1 special shares and the Series B-1 Special
Shares of Microsemi Storage Solutions Ltd., (the " _Special Shares_ ") a
Canadian subsidiary of the Company, shall remain outstanding, and subject to
and from and after the Effective Time, the holders of each Special Share
shall, pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, be entitled to
receive, upon the exchange or retraction (i.e., redemption at the option of
the holder) thereof, in lieu of the consideration that would have been
payable in respect of such MSS Special Shares, an amount in cash, without
interest as determined by the terms of the Exchange Agreement, equal to (as
applicable):

 

(i) for each Series 1-A Special Share, the result of (i) $68.78 multiplied by
8 multiplied by 0.0771 plus (ii) $9.22 multiplied by 8; and

(ii) for each Series 1-B Special Share, the result of (i) $68.78 multiplied
by 2.18448 multiplied by 0.0771 plus (ii) $9.22 multiplied by 2.18448.

2.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a
nationally recognized bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ ").

(b) _Exchange Fund_. Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Unvested Restricted
Stock) and the Company Compensatory Awards pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article_ __ _ II_, an amount of cash equal to the sum of (I) the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the Merger Consideration by (y) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (excluding Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares)
plus (II) all such

 



22  cash amounts and to be paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)_ at the
Closing (other than Escrowed Compensatory Payments) (such aggregate cash
amount being referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than for the purpose provided for
in this Agreement and shall be held in trust for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (excluding Cancelled Shares, Dissenting Shares and Unvested
Restricted Stock) and the holders of Company Compensatory Awards. In the event
that the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments
contemplated by this _Article_ __ _ II_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or
cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Payment Agent in an amount
sufficient to make such payments.

 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. As promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time, but in any event within five days following the Closing Date, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail (i) to
each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of
shares of Company Common Stock represented by Certificates (A) a letter
of transmittal in customary form and containing customary provisions (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Payment
Agent) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article_ __ _ II_ and (ii) to
each holder of Uncertificated Shares, a notice that the Merger has become
effective. Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock represented by a
Certificate that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in
respect of such shares of Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate,
upon surrender to the Payment Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly
completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents
as may reasonably be requested by the Payment Agent. Until so surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate shall represent after
the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article_ __ _ II_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash
payable upon the surrender or transfer of such Certificate. Payment of the
Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefore, to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement with respect to
Uncertificated Shares shall be made promptly following the Effective Time
without any action on the part of the person in whose name such Company Book-
Entry Shares are registered. Payment of the cash amounts to be made to holders
of Company Compensatory Awards, as contemplated to be paid pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)_, shall be made by the Paying Agent to UBS Financial
Services, LLC as custodian for the Company Compensatory Awards promptly
following the Effective Time without any action on the part of such holders of
Company Compensatory Awards or in such other manner as the Company and Parent
shall reasonably agree prior to Closing. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company may, at its option, fund the cash
amounts to be paid at the Closing to the holders of Company Compensatory
Awards (such amounts, " _Escrowed Compensatory Payments_ "), to UBS or a
third party escrow agent, no more than three (3) Business Days prior to
Closing, to be held in trust for and automatically released to, the holders of
the Company Compensatory Awards promptly following the Effective Time.

 



23 (d) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to
be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be
a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such
Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Payment Agent any transfer or other
similar Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to
the satisfaction of the Payment Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to
be deducted or withheld therefrom under Applicable Law. To the extent that
such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts (i) shall be remitted
by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent, as the
case may be, to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) shall, to the
extent so remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity, be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to
any abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Law.

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Shares on the date that
is one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon
demand, and any holders of Shares that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore
exchanged their Shares for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ shall thereafter look only to Parent, as general
creditors thereof, for any payment of and claim to the applicable Merger
Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions
of this _Article_ __ _ II_. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of
Shares one (1) year after the Effective Time (or such earlier date,
immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity) shall become, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

2.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist,
and each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Share
theretofore representing any shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Dissenting Shares and Cancelled Shares) shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable
therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 2.8_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the
terms of this _Article_ __ _ II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights 

 



24 pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the
Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other
than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement
procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration as provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this _Article_ __ _ II_.

2.10  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_;
_provided, however_ , as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger
Consideration, the Payment Agent shall require the owners of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to furnish a bond in form satisfactory to the
Payment Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed. The value of the bond of indemnity shall be calculated by
the Payment Agent, based on the value of lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates.

2.11 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the directors and
officers of the Surviving Corporation shall take all such lawful and necessary
action on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub.

Except, with respect to any Section of this _Article_ __ _ III_, as set forth
in the section of the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent on
the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") that
specifically relates to such Section or in another section of the Company
Disclosure Letter to the extent it is reasonably apparent from the text of

Material Adverse Effect. The Company is not in violation of its certificate
of incorporation or bylaws in any material respect.

(b) The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or the
nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent the
"good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside
the United States), except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete and correct copies
of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended to date.

 

3.2 _Subsidiaries_.

(a)  _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a

equity or voting interest in, any Person.

(b) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect: each of
the Companys Subsidiaries (i) is duly organized, validly existing and in good

organization (to the extent the "good standing" concept is applicable in the

being conducted and to own, lease or operate its respective properties and

of incorporation, bylaws or other applicable constituent documents. The
Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete and correct copies
of the certificates of incorporation and bylaws or other constituent

(c) All of the outstanding capital stock of, or other equity or
voting interest in, each Subsidiary of the Company (i) have been duly
authorized, validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable and (ii) are
owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company, free and clear of all Liens
(other than Permitted Liens and restrictions on transfer imposed by Applicable
Law) and free of any other restriction (including any restriction on the right
to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity or
voting interest) that would prevent the operation by the Surviving Corporation
of such Subsidiarys business as presently conducted.

 



26 (d) There are no outstanding (i) securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of,
or other equity or voting interest in, any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii)
options, stock appreciation rights, warrants, restricted stock units, rights
or other commitments or agreements to acquire from the Company or any of its

or other equity or voting interest in, any Subsidiary of the Company, (iii)
obligations of the Company to grant, extend or enter into any subscription,
warrant, right, convertible or exchangeable security or other similar
agreement or commitment (whether payable in equity, cash or otherwise)
relating to any capital stock of, or other equity or voting interest
(including any voting debt) in, any Subsidiary of the Company (the items in
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), together with the capital stock of the
Subsidiaries of the Company, being referred to collectively as " _Subsidiary
Securities_ ") or (iv) other obligations by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to make any payments based on the price or value of any
Subsidiary Securities. There are no Contracts of any kind which obligate the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any outstanding Subsidiary Securities.

 

3.3 _Authorization_.

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and, subject in the case of the Merger to obtaining
the Requisite Stockholder Approval, to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution

the representation in _Section_ __ _ 4.7_, the consummation by the Company of

additional corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to

its terms, except that such enforceability (i) may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar
Applicable Law affecting or relating to creditors rights generally and (ii)

_Enforceability Limitations_ ").

(b) At a meeting duly called and held prior to the execution of this
Agreement, the Company Board unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are advisable
and fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,
(ii) declared advisable and approved this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (iii) assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub in _Section_ __ _
4.7_, took all actions necessary so that the restrictions on business

respective properties and assets. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where
the character of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its

Effect.

4.2  _Authorization_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to perform its obligations

necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, and no
additional corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, other
than the approval of this Agreement in its capacity as the sole stockholder of
Merger Sub, are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger). This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and

and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

(b) No Consent of any Governmental Entity is required on the part of Parent,

have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

4.4 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there are no Legal Proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or Merger
Sub or any of their Affiliates that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the

to stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

4.6 _Operations of Merger Sub_. Merger Sub has engaged in no other business
activities other than those related to the transactions contemplated by this

51 4.7 _Section_ __ _ 203 of the DGCL_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub, nor
any "affiliate" or "associate" (as such terms are defined in Section 203 of
the DGCL) of Parent or Merger Sub is, nor at any time for the past three years
has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section
203 of the DGCL. As of the date hereof, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Subsidiaries owns any Company Common Stock.

 

4.8 _F_ _inancing_.

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and accurate copy of
an executed commitment letter of even date herewith, and the executed fee
letter related thereto of even date herewith (which such fee letter may be
redacted in a customary manner), in each case from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
(collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letters_ "), pursuant to which the
lender party(ies) thereto (the " _Debt Financing Sources_ ") has/have
committed to provide, subject only to the terms and conditions set forth
therein, debt financing for the Merger in the aggregate amount set forth
therein (the " _Debt Financing_ "). Any reference in this Agreement to (i)
"Debt Commitment Letters" will include such documents as amended or modified
in compliance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.15_, and (ii) the "Debt
Financing" will include the financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters as amended or modified in compliance with the provisions
of _Section_ __ _ 6.15_. Parent has, or has caused one of its Subsidiaries to
have, fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees that have been
incurred and are due and payable in connection with the Debt Commitment
Letters prior to or in connection with the execution of this Agreement and
Parent has otherwise satisfied all of the other terms and conditions required
to be satisfied by it prior to the execution of this Agreement pursuant to
the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters. Each of the Debt Commitment Letters,
in the form so delivered to the Company, is in full force and effect and is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of
Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable against the parties thereto in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Limitations. Subject
to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in _Article VII_
and assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement and performance by the Company of its obligations
hereunder, to the knowledge of Parent, there are no facts or circumstances
in existence as of the date hereof that would cause any of the Debt Financing
Conditions to not be satisfied.

(b) As of the date hereof, (i) none of the Debt Commitment Letters has been
amended or modified, and no such amendment or modification is contemplated by
Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto (other than as
set forth in the fee letters with regard to flex rights and/or to add
additional lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents and
similar entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the
date of this Agreement), and (ii) none of the respective commitments set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letters have been withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect. Except as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters, as of the date
hereof, there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or
arrangements relating to the Debt Financing. No event has occurred which,
with or without notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default
or breach on the part of Parent under any term or condition of the Debt
Commitment Letters, or otherwise result in any portion of the Debt Financing
contemplated thereby to be unavailable. There are no conditions precedent or
other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt
Financing or that would permit the Debt Financing Sources to reduce the total
amount of the Debt Financing, other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters in the form so delivered to the Company (the " _Debt Financing
Conditions_ ").

 



52 4.9 _Funds_. Parent will have (and will cause Merger Sub to have), immediately
prior to the Effective Time, sufficient funds to satisfy and perform all of
Parents and Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement, including to pay
the aggregate Merger Consideration and all amounts payable pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Parent acknowledges that its obligations under this
Agreement are not conditioned upon or subject to its receipt of the proceeds
made available under the Debt Commitment Letters or any other Debt Financing.

4.10 _No Reliance_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Article_ __ _
IV_ or any other provision hereof, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges
and agrees that neither the Company nor any other Person on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is making (or has made) any representation
or warranty whatsoever, express or implied, written or oral, and neither
Parent nor Merger Sub has relied on, and each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby
disclaims reliance on, any representation, warranty, or other statement or
omission of the Company, any other Person acting on behalf of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, beyond those expressly given in _Article_ __ _ III_;
_provided that_ , the foregoing shall not be deemed to limit or waive any
rights or remedies of Parent or Merger Sub with respect to fraud in
connection with the making of the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in _Article III_.

later than twenty-four (24) hours thereafter) upon receipt of any written
material amendment or written proposed amendment of any such
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall give Parent a copy thereof.

6.2 _Company Board Recommendation; Intervening Events_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, the Company Board shall
(i) recommend that the Companys stockholders adopt this Agreement in
accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law (the " _Company
Board Recommendation_ ") and (ii) include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement.

 

(b) Subject to the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, at all times during the
period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article_ __ _ VIII_ and the Effective Time, neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, amend or modify in a

publicly endorse, adopt or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or Superior
Proposal, (iii) in the case of any publicly announced Acquisition Proposal
that is a tender offer or exchange offer, fail to recommend against acceptance
of any tender offer or exchange offer for the Company Common Stock that
constitutes an Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) Business Days after the
commencement of such offer, or (iv) pass a resolution to approve or publicly
propose to take any of the foregoing actions (any of the foregoing, a "Company
Board Recommendation Change"; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, none
of (1) a determination by the Company Board that an Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or would be reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal in
compliance with the provisions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_, (2) a
statement to the effect that the Company Board is considering an Acquisition
Proposal in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement, (3) the
determination by the Company Board that an 

 



58  Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal in connection with a
Company Board Recommendation change in compliance with the provisions set
forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(c)(i)_, or (4) the Companys delivery to Parent
of any notice contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ or this _Section_ __ _
6.2_ shall be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change and terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)(ii)_ to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal at any time prior to
obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, if and only if:

(i) (A) the Company Board has received a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a breach (or deemed breach) of _Section_ __
_ 6.1_ that constitutes a Superior Proposal, (B) the Company Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure
to effect such Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be likely
to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to stockholders of the Company
under Delaware Law, (C) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation
Change, the Company shall have (1) given Parent at least four (4) Business
Days notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") of its intention to take such action
(which notice shall include the most current version of the proposed
definitive agreement and, to the extent not included therein, all material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person
making such Superior Proposal) and (2) caused its financial and legal advisors
to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith any
modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by
Parent, in its discretion, and (D) Parent shall not have made, within the
Notice Period, a written counter-offer or proposal capable of acceptance as a
binding contract that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel, is at
least as favorable, from a financial point of view, to stockholders of the
Company, in their capacity as such, as such Superior Proposal (it being
understood that (x) any material revision to the material terms of a Superior
Proposal, including any revision in price, shall require a new notice pursuant
to clause (C) above (except that the "Notice Period" shall be three (3)
Business Days) and (y) there may be more than one Notice Period; or

(ii) (A) a fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances occurs or
exists after the date of this Agreement that materially effects the business,
operations, financial condition or results of operations of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (and not relating in any way to (x) an Acquisition
Proposal or (y) any fluctuation in the market price or trading volume of the
Company Common Stock, in and of itself) that was neither known to the Company
Board nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of or prior to the
date of this Agreement (such material fact, event, change, development or set
of circumstances, an " _Intervening Event_ ") shall have occurred and be
continuing, (B) the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect such
Company Board Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to constitute a
breach of its fiduciary duties to stockholders of the Company under Delaware
Law, (C) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the
Company shall have (1) given Parent at least four (4) Business Days prior
written notice of its intention to take such action (which

 



59  notice shall include a written explanation of the Company Boards basis and
rationale for proposing to effect such Company Board Recommendation Change)
and (2) if requested by Parent, negotiated with Parent in good faith during
such four (4) Business Day notice period any modifications to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent, in its discretion, and (D) Parent shall not
have made, within the four (4) Business Day notice period, a written offer or
proposal capable of acceptance that the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and its outside legal
counsel, would obviate the need for the Company Board to effect such Company
Board Recommendation Change.

(d) The Company shall ensure that any Company Board Recommendation Change (A)
does not change or otherwise affect the approval of this Agreement by the
Company Board and (B) does not have the effect of causing Section 203 of the
DGCL to be applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking and
disclosing to stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
under the Exchange Act (including by issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement); provided that any statement(s) made by the Company Board pursuant
to Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act
other than a "stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by
Section 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act or any similar communication to
stockholders of the Company shall be deemed to be a Company Board
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms
the Company Board Recommendation in such communication.

 

(f) The Company shall not take any action to (i) approve any transaction
under, or any Third Party becoming an "interested stockholder" under, Section
203 of the DGCL, (ii) exempt any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Affiliates) from the provisions on "business combinations"
contained in any antitakeover law or (iii) otherwise cause such restrictions
not to apply, in each case unless such actions are taken substantially
simultaneously with a termination of this Agreement by the Company in
accordance with the terms hereof.

 

6.3 _Company Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_. Subject to Applicable Law, the rules
and regulations of the Nasdaq and the Companys certificate of incorporation
and bylaws, the Company shall establish a record date for, call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of the stockholders of the Company (the "
_Company Stockholders_ __ _ Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable following
the date of this Agreement (and in no event later than forty (40) days after
the commencement of the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Companys
stockholders) for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement
in accordance with Delaware Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if there
are insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock necessary to conduct
business at the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company may postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting to the extent (and only to the
extent) the Company reasonably determines that such postponement or
adjournment is necessary in order to conduct business at the
Company Stockholders Meeting, (b) the Company may postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholders Meeting to the extent (and only to the extent)

 



60  the Company reasonably determines that such postponement or adjournment is
required by Applicable Law, including to comply with comments made by the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement, and (c) the Company may postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting to the extent (and only to the
extent) the Company reasonably determines that such postponement or
adjournment is necessary to solicit sufficient proxies to secure the
Requisite Stockholder Approval. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ and _Section_
__ _ 6.2_, the Company shall solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure the Requisite Stockholder
Approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting. Unless this Agreement is
earlier terminated pursuant to  _Article_ __ _ VIII_, the Company shall
establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholders Meeting in compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_,
whether or not (i) the Company Board at any time subsequent to the date
hereof shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change or otherwise
shall determine that this Agreement is no longer advisable or recommends that
stockholders of the Company reject it or (ii) there occurs the commencement,
disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of any Acquisition
Proposal. Notwithstanding herein to the contrary, the Company may adjourn or
postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to a date no later than the second
Business Day after the expiration of any notice periods contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 6.2(c)_. The Company agrees that it shall not submit to the
vote of the stockholders of the Company any Acquisition Proposal (whether or
not a Superior Proposal) prior to the vote of the Companys stockholders with
respect to the Merger at the Company Stockholders Meeting. The notice of such
Company Stockholders Meeting shall state that a resolution to adopt this
Agreement, a non-binding, advisory resolution to approve the compensation that
may become payable to the Companys named executive officers in connection
with the Merger, and a resolution to adjourn the Company Stockholders
Meeting will be considered at the Company Stockholders Meeting, and no other
matters shall be considered or voted upon at the Company Stockholders Meeting
without Parents prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).

6.4 _Proxy Statement_. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, the preliminary
Proxy Statement. Parent shall furnish to the Company all information
concerning Parent as the Company may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement. Subject to
Applicable Law, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be disseminated to stockholders of the Company as promptly
as practicable following the filing thereof with the SEC. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to file with the SEC the definitive Proxy
Statement, and to cause the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the
stockholders of the Company to be commenced, by the later of (a) (i) if the
Company receives comments from the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy
Statement, on or prior to the third (3rd) Business Day immediately following
clearance by the SEC with respect to such comments, or (ii) if the Company
does not receive comments from the SEC with respect to the preliminary
Proxy Statement, on or prior to the third (3rd) Business Day immediately
following the expiration of the 10-day waiting period provided in Rule
14a-6(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (b) the third (3rd) Business
Day immediately following the record date set for the Company Stockholders
Meeting; _provided, however_ , that the Company will use reasonable best
efforts to set the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting on or
prior to the latest date referred

 



61  to in clause (a) above . No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or
correspondence with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement
shall be made by the Company without providing Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon; _provided, however_ , that
following or in connection with a Change of Company Board Recommendation,
Parents right to review and comment shall be limited to only those
disclosures relating to Parent. The Company shall advise Parent, promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC or its staff for
an amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement, or comments thereon and
responses thereto, or requests by the SEC or its staff for additional
information in connection therewith, and shall provide Parent with copies of
all correspondence between the Company or any of its advisors or
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other
government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement
or other filing with the SEC related to this Agreement or the Merger. If at
any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any information relating
to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective directors, officers or
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy
Statement does not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omits
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party or
parties hereto, as the case may be, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement describing such information shall be promptly prepared
and filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Applicable Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. The Company shall cause the
Proxy Statement to comply as to form and substance in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, Delaware Law and the
rules of the Nasdaq. Each of Parent and the Company shall share equally all
filing and printing fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
_Section_ __ _ 6.4_ (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, all fees and
expenses payable to any attorneys, accountants or other advisors incurred in
connection with this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_, which shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses).

 

6.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts to Complete_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or parties hereto in
doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), including
using reasonable best efforts to: (i) cause the conditions to the Merger set
forth in  _Article_ __ _ VII_ hereof to be satisfied or fulfilled; (ii)
obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals under any Material
Contracts or Leases to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) so as to maintain and preserve the
benefits under such Contracts following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger); (iii) obtain all necessary
actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals, Orders and
authorizations from Governmental Entities, the expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting periods, making all necessary registrations,
declarations and filings (including registrations, declarations and filings
with Governmental Entities, if any), and (iv) execute or deliver any
additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement.

 



62 (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of  _Section_
__ _ 6.5(a)_, as soon as reasonably practicable following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall file with the
FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Merger) as required by the HSR Act (and each of Parent and the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to file such HSR Form within ten (10)
Business Days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement), as well
as comparable pre-merger notification filings, forms and submissions with any
foreign Governmental Entity that may be required by the Antitrust Laws of any
applicable foreign jurisdiction as soon as reasonably practicable. Each of
Parent and the Company shall promptly (i) cooperate and coordinate with the
other in the making of such filings, (ii) supply the other with any
information that may be required in order to effectuate such filings and (iii)
supply any additional information that reasonably may be required or requested
by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger control authorities of any
other applicable jurisdiction. Each party hereto shall promptly inform the
other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any communication from
any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Merger). If any party hereto or Affiliate
thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary material
from any such Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), then such party shall
use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request. Subject to Applicable
Law, no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or written correspondence
with any Governmental Entity or its staff with respect to such Antitrust Laws
shall be made by the Company or Parent without providing the other party
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of  _Section_
__ _ 6.5(a)_, in the event that any antitakeover law is or becomes applicable
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Merger), the Parent and Company, at the direction of the
Parent Board or the Company Board (as applicable), shall use reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Merger) may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger).

 

(d) Parent and Merger Sub shall take reasonable best efforts to obtain any
clearance or approval from any Governmental Entity or to prevent
the initiation of any lawsuit by any Governmental Entity under any antitrust
or competition law or to prevent the entry of any decree, judgment,
injunction, preliminary or permanent, or any order that would otherwise make
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unlawful. Notwithstanding the
forgoing anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is expressly
understood and agreed that: neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be under any
obligation to make proposals, execute or carry out 

 



63  agreements, enter into consent decrees or submit to orders providing for (A)
the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition or holding separate
(through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets or
categories of assets of Parent or any of its Affiliates or the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, (B) the imposition of any limitation or regulation on the
ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to freely conduct their business
or own such assets, or (C) the holding separate of the shares of Company
Common Stock or any limitation or regulation on the ability of Parent or any
of its Affiliates to exercise full rights of ownership of the shares
of Company Common Stock, if in the case of clauses (A), (B) or (C) above such
sale, divestiture, license, disposition, holding separate, limitation or
regulation applicable to the Company would have or would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse
effect on the business, operations, financial condition or results of
operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall
not knowingly take any action (including the acquisition by it or its
Affiliates of any interest in any Person that derives revenues from products,
services or lines of business that compete with the Companys products,
services or lines of business) if such action would make it materially more
likely that there would arise any impediments under any Antitrust Law with
respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

6.6 _Access_.

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII and the Effective Time, the Company
shall (x) afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours and in a manner that does not unreasonably disrupt or
interfere with business operations, upon reasonable notice, to the properties,
books and records and personnel of the Company, as Parent may reasonably
request and (y) furnish to Parent such existing financial and operating data
and other existing information as such Persons may reasonably request, and
afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access to officers and
employees of the Company in order to discuss such data and information;
_provided, however_ , that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement (as amended pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.9_) shall apply to any
information provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_; and
_provided further_ , that the Company shall not be required to, nor shall the
Company be required to cause its Subsidiaries to, afford access or disclose
any information that in the good faith judgment of the Company would (a)
violate any obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Third
Party, (b) jeopardize protections afforded the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries under the attorney-client privilege or attorney work product
doctrine, or (c) violate any Applicable Law or Order. In the event that the
Company does not provide access to or disclose information to Parent in
reliance on the final proviso of the preceding sentence, it shall use
reasonable best efforts to communicate such information in a manner that does
not result in the violation of any such obligation, Law or Order or the
jeopardy of such protections. Any investigation by Parent pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.6 _shall be conducted under supervision of appropriate
personnel of the Company and in such manner as not to unreasonably interfere
with the conduct of the business of the Company, and shall not include the
collection or analysis of any environmental samples.

 



64 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided under this _Section_ __ _ 6.6 _and
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_ or otherwise as either "Outside Counsel Only Material"
or "Antitrust Restricted Material." Outside Counsel Only Material and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers, directors or other Representatives of the recipient
unless express permission is obtained in advance from the Company or its legal
counsel. Antitrust Restricted Material and the information contained therein
shall be given only to outside antitrust counsel and other outside
Representatives of the recipient and employees, officers or directors of the
recipient approved by the Company, and will not be disclosed by such Persons
to other employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express
permission is obtained in advance from the Company or its legal counsel.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
materials provided pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ or _Section_ __ _
6.5_ or otherwise may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the
valuation of Parent, the Company and the Merger and other confidential
information, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and
(iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns.

6.7 _Notification_. The Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing, and
Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing, of: (a) any written
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or
another Person) is or may be required in connection the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby; (b) any written communication from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (other than such communications contemplated by 
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_, which shall be governed by such Section) or (c) any
actions, claims, investigations, suits or proceedings commenced or, to the
Knowledge of the Company or Parent, as applicable, threatened against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in the case of the Company) or Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries (in the case of Parent) that (1) are related to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (including any
transaction litigation brought by a stockholder of the Company or Parent, as
applicable) or (2) would be reasonably likely to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect, or (d) written notice from any third party of any Effect that
would be reasonably expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

6.8 _Merger Sub Stockholder Vote_. Promptly following the date of this
Agreement, Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, shall approve and
adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger.

 

6.9 _Certain Litigation_. Each Party shall promptly advise the other Parties
orally and in writing after becoming aware of any Legal Proceeding commenced
after the date hereof against it or any of its directors by any its
stockholder (on their own behalf or on behalf of it) relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and
shall keep the other Parties reasonably informed regarding any such Legal
Proceeding. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the
Company regarding the defense or settlement of any such stockholder litigation
and shall consider Parents views with respect to such stockholder litigation
and shall not settle any such stockholder litigation without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



65 6.10 _Confidentiality_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge
that Parent and the Company have previously executed a Confidentiality
Agreement, dated November 20, 2017 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
which shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms;
_provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, effective as of the
execution and delivery hereof, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed
to be amended so as to permit Parent to make any counter-offer or proposal
contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)(ii)_
(which deemed amendment shall survive any termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms or otherwise).

 

6.11 _Public Disclosure_. Each of the Company and Parent shall not, without
the prior written consent of the other (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), issue any press release or
otherwise make any public statement or any written communication to employees
that would reasonably be expected to be required to be filed with the SEC or
any oral communication to more than fifty (50) employees, in each case, with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Merger), except (a) as may be required by Applicable Law or any listing
agreement with a national securities exchange, in which case the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, shall make commercially reasonable efforts to
consult with the other prior to any such release or public statement and (b)
in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or with regard to or following a
Company Board Recommendation Change, in which cases the Company shall not be
required to consult with, or obtain any consent from, Parent.

 

6.12 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) The Company shall terminate, effective as of the day immediately preceding
the date the Company becomes a member of the same Controlled Group of
Corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent (the "
_401(k) Termination Date_ "), any and all 401(k) plans maintained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, unless Parent provides written notice
to the Company no later than five (5) business days prior to the Effective
that such 401(k) plan(s) shall not be terminated. The Company shall provide
Parent evidence that the 401(k) plan(s) of the Company and its Subsidiaries
have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board or the
board of directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable. The Company Board shall
in any case adopt resolutions effective no later than the Effective Time
eliminating Company stock as the funding vehicle for matching contributions
and as an available investment under any such 401(k) plan, as applicable. The
form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable
review and approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. As soon as practicable following the 401(k) Termination Date, Parent
shall permit all Continuing Employees who were eligible to participate in any
401(k) plan maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the 401(k) Termination Date to participate in Parents
401(k) plan, and shall permit each such Continuing Employee to elect to
transfer his or her account balance when distributed from any terminated
401(k) plan maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including
any outstanding participant loans from such 401(k) plans, to Parents 401(k)
plan, except to the extent accepting such transfers would adversely affect
the tax-qualified status of the Parent 401(k) plan.

 



66 (b) From the Effective Time through the first anniversary of the Closing Date
(the " _Transition Period_ "), Parent will provide or cause to be provided to
each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time
working in the United States who continues employment with Parent or any of
its direct or indirect Subsidiaries (each, an "Affected Employee"), while
employed by Parent or any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, compensation
and benefits the value of which is not less favorable to the Affected Employee
in the aggregate to the aggregate value of the compensation and benefits
provided to such Affected Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) During the Transition Period, (i) each Affected Employee, while employed
by the Parent or any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, will be provided
base wages or salary, as applicable, that are not less than the base wages or
salary, as applicable, provided to such Affected Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) each Affected Employee will be provided
severance benefits not less favorable in amount or with regard to terms and
conditions to receive such severance benefits than those provided to the
Affected Employee by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause any employee benefit plans in which the Affected Employees
are entitled to participate to take into account for all purposes, including
eligibility, vesting, level of benefits and benefit accrual (but not for
benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan, unless
required by Applicable Law), thereunder, service for the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and their respective predecessors) as if such service were with
Parent, to the same extent such service was credited under a comparable plan
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and their respective predecessor
entities) prior to the Effective Time (except to the extent it would result in
a duplication of benefits or compensation with respect to the same period of
service), and Affected Employees will be immediately eligible to participate
in any such plans, without any waiting period, to the extent such Affected
Employee was eligible to participate in the comparable Employee Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time. To the extent any health or welfare
benefit plan replaces an Employee Plan that is a health or welfare benefit
plan, Parent will, and will cause its direct and indirect Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Company) to use its or their reasonable best efforts
to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting condition exclusions,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements, and all waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each
Affected Employee to the extent waived or satisfied under the replaced
Employee Plan and (ii) credit each Affected Employee for any applicable
amounts (whether in the nature of co-payments or coinsurance amounts, amounts
applied toward deductibles or other out-of-pocket expenses) under the terms of
the replaced Employee Plan toward satisfying any applicable deductible, co-
payment or out-of-pocket requirements under the health benefit plan that
replaces such an Employee Plan for the plan year in which the transition
between plans occurs.

 



67 (e) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ or any other provision
of this Agreement (i) will be construed to amend or modify, as of the date of
this Agreement, any Employee Plan, or any benefit, compensation or severance
plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement sponsored by the
Company, Parent or their Affiliates, (ii) will limit the ability of Parent or
any of its Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit, compensation
or severance plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement that is
assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by Parent or its Affiliates,
provided any such amendment, modification or termination must comply with the
terms thereof and Applicable Law, (iii) will create any third-party
beneficiary rights or obligations in any Person (including any Affected
Employee) other than the parties to this Agreement, or (iv) will limit the
right of Parent (or its Subsidiaries) to terminate, in accordance with
Applicable Law, the employment or service of any employee or other service
provider during the Transition Period.

6.13 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor and fulfill in all
respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under their
respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar
organizational documents) and all agreements for indemnification, exculpation
of liability or advancement of expenses, in effect as of the date hereof
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
current or former directors, officers, employees and agents or any person who
becomes a director, officer, employee or agent prior to the Effective Time
(the " _Indemnified Parties_ "). For six (6) years after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of present and former directors, officers, employees and agents of
the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect
of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering
each person covered by the DandO Insurance immediately prior to the Effective
Time, on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts no less favorable than
those of the DandO Insurance in effect on the date of this Agreement;
_provided, however_ , that the Surviving Corporation may, at its option,
substitute therefor policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries containing terms (including with respect
to limits, coverage, amount) no less favorable to such persons than the DandO
Insurance, _provided further, however_ , that in satisfying its obligations
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.13(b)_, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three
hundred percent (300%) of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its
last full fiscal year (such three hundred percent (300%) amount, the "
_Maximum Annual Premium_ ") (which premiums the Company represents and
warrants to be as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter), _provided further_ that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy (the " _Tail Policy_ ")
on the DandO

 



68  Insurance on terms and conditions no less favorable, in the aggregate, than
the DandO Insurance and for a per annum amount not to exceed three hundred
percent (300%) of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last
full fiscal year. In the event that the Company does not purchase the Tail
Policy, Parent may purchase a Tail Policy on the DandO Insurance containing
terms and conditions (including with respect to limits, coverage, amount) no
less favorable to each person covered by the DandO insurance immediately prior
to the Effective Time, in the aggregate, than the DandO Insurance. In the event
that either the Company or Parent shall purchase such a Tail Policy prior to
the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such
Tail Policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective
obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _
6.13(b)_ for so long as such Tail Policy shall be maintained in full force and
effect.

 

(c) The obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under a Tail
Policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.13(b)_ (and their heirs and
representatives)) without the prior written consent of such person. Each of
the Indemnified Parties or other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO
Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.13(b)_ (and
their heirs and representatives) are intended to be Third Party beneficiaries
of this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_, with full rights of enforcement as if a party
thereto.

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.13_. The rights of the
Indemnified Parties (and other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO
Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.13(b)_ (and
their heirs and representatives)) under this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ shall be
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such
persons may have under the certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or
other equivalent organizational documents and any and all indemnification
agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
Applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

 

6.14 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and payment of any
amounts payable hereunder, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

6.15 _F_ _inancing_.

 

(a) _Debt Financing_. Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and obtain the
financing contemplated thereby on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letters, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect each of the Debt Commitment Letters in 

 



69  accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions (including the flex
provisions) thereof, (ii) comply with its obligations under each of the Debt
Commitment Letters, (iii) negotiate, execute and deliver definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters, (iv) satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain the waiver of)
all conditions to funding that are within the control of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in the Debt Commitment Letters and the definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters,
and (v) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing and at or
prior to the Closing, draw such amount of the Debt Financing required on the
Closing Date, taking into account cash on hand and other sources of funds
available to the Parent, necessary to pay the Merger Consideration. Parent
will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, fully pay, or cause to be fully
paid, all commitment or other fees arising pursuant to the Debt Commitment
Letters as and when they become due.

(b) _N_ _o Amendments to Debt Commitment Letters_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Parent will, and will cause its Subsidiaries
to, not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of
any provision or remedy pursuant to, the Debt Commitment Letters without the
prior written consent of the Company if such amendment, modification or
waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing below the
amount required to consummate the Merger (taking into account other sources of
funding), or (ii) impose new or additional conditions or other terms to the
Debt Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to
the receipt of the Debt Financing, in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to: (A) materially delay, prevent or impede the consummation of
the Merger, or (B) make the timely funding of the Debt Financing, or the
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing, materially
less likely to occur; _provided_ , that Parent and any of its Subsidiaries may
consent to, replace or amend the Debt Financing to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not
executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date hereof. In addition to the
foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, not release or
consent to the termination of the Debt Commitment Letters or of any individual
lender under the Debt Commitment Letters, except for (x) assignments and
replacements of an individual lender under the terms of, and only in
connection with, the syndication of the Debt Financing under the Debt
Commitment Letters, or (y) replacements of the Debt Commitment Letters with
alternative financing commitments pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.15(c)_.
Parent shall promptly, and in any event within three (3) Business Days,
provide copies of any executed amendment to the Debt Commitment Letters to the
Company.

 

(c) _Alternate Debt Financing_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing _Section_ __ _ 6.15(b)_, in the event that any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letters (after giving effect to all applicable flex
provisions), Parent shall promptly notify the Company, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, (i) obtain alternative
financing from alternative sources on terms and conditions not materially less
favorable in the aggregate to Parent than those set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters and in an amount at least equal to the amount (taking into
account cash on hand and other sources of funds available to the Parent)
required to consummate the 

 



70  Merger (the " _Alternate Debt Financing_ "), and (ii) obtain one or more new
financing commitment letters with respect to such Alternate Debt Financing
(the " _New Debt Commitment Letters_ "), which New Debt Commitment Letters
will replace the existing Debt Commitment Letters in whole or in part. Parent
shall promptly provide the Company with a copy of any New Debt Commitment
Letters (and any fee letter in connection therewith, which such fee letter
may be redacted in a customary manner). In the event that any New Debt
Commitment Letters are obtained, (A) any reference in this Agreement to the
"Debt Commitment Letters" will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment
Letters to the extent not superseded by the New Debt Commitment Letters at the
time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in
effect, and (B) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" means
the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified
pursuant to the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.15_ shall
require, and in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries be deemed or construed to require, either Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries to (A) pay any fees or any interest rates applicable to the
Debt Financing in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters
(including the flex provisions), or (B) agree to any "market flex" term less
favorable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries than such corresponding market
flex term contained in or contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (in
either case, whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or
otherwise).

 

(d) _I_ _nformation_. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing, and Parent shall, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the Debt Financing Sources to, provide the Company with such access to the
Debt Financing Sources as the Company may reasonably request for the purpose
of allowing the Company to understand the status of Parents efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice upon
having actual knowledge of any material breach by any party of any of the Debt
Commitment Letters or any termination of any of the Debt Commitment Letters.

(e) _Company Support_.

 

(i) Prior to the Closing Date, subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.15(e)(ii)_, the
Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and, will use reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to, at Parents sole
expense, use reasonable best efforts to provide Parent and its Subsidiaries
with all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to assist it in causing the conditions in the Debt Commitment
Letters to be satisfied or as is otherwise reasonably requested by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Debt Financing, the Alternative
Financing and any other debt or capital markets (including private placement)

6.17 _Payoff Letters_. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain
and deliver to Parent no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the

termination) under the Company Credit Agreement and the documents related
thereto (collectively, the " _Loan Documents_ "), (ii) the termination of the
Loan Documents and (iii) the release of all Liens held pursuant to or
otherwise related to the Loan Documents, and the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to deliver to Parent no later than two (2) Business Days prior to

6.18 _Actions with Respect to Existing Debt_.

 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been validly terminated in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, the Company shall, upon receiving any
written request by Parent to do so, use its reasonable best efforts to
promptly commence a tender offer (the " _Notes Tender Offer_ ") for all of the
outstanding principal amount of its 9.125% Senior Notes due in fiscal year
2023 (the " _Senior Notes_ "); _provided, however_ , that if Parent so elects
in its sole discretion, in lieu of or in addition to the Notes Tender Offer,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to facilitate a covenant
defeasance pursuant to Section 8.03 of the Senior Notes Indenture or a
discharge pursuant to Section 11.01 of the Senior Notes Indenture upon the
prior or simultaneous occurrence of the Closing and the consummation of the
Financing on the Closing Date, in either case as reasonably requested by
Parent in writing; provided that Parent or the Surviving Corporation funds any
such defeasance or discharge. As part of any Notes Tender Offer, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the consent of the holders
of the Senior Notes to amend, eliminate or waive certain sections (as mutually
agreed by Parent and the Company) of the Senior Notes Indenture (the "
_Notes Consents_ ""). The aggregate consideration payable to each holder of
Senior Notes pursuant to the Notes Tender Offer shall be an amount in cash
established and funded by Parent. The Notes Tender Offer shall be made
pursuant to an Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement prepared
by the Company in connection with the Notes Tender Offer in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company; provided that any such
Notes Tender Offer shall be subject to the conditions set forth in _Section_
__ _ 6.18(b)_ (as amended from time to time, the " _Notes Offer to Purchase_
").

 

(b) The Companys and the Surviving Corporations obligation to accept for
payment and pay for the Senior Notes tendered pursuant to the Notes Tender
Offer or make any payment for the Notes Consents shall be subject to
conditions (as mutually agreed by Parent and the Company), including that (i)
the Merger shall have occurred (or Parent and the Company shall be
satisfied that it will occur substantially concurrently with such acceptance
and payment), (ii) the Financing has been obtained and (iii) such other
conditions as are customary for transactions similar to the Notes Tender
Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Notes Tender Offer,
substantially concurrently with the Closing, Parent agrees to cause the
Surviving Corporation to accept for payment and thereafter to promptly pay for
all Senior Notes (and related Notes Consents) validly tendered and not
withdrawn. The Company shall waive any of the conditions to the Notes Tender
Offer as may be reasonably requested by Parent (other than the conditions that
the Notes Tender Offer is conditioned on the Closing having occurred and
the Financing as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above), so long as such
waivers would not cause the Notes Tender Offer to violate the Exchange Act,
the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended

 



76  (the " _TIA_ "), or any other Applicable Law, and shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Notes Tender Offer
or make any change, amendment or modification to the terms and conditions of
the Notes Tender Offer (including any extension thereof) other than as agreed
between Parent and the Company or as required in the reasonable judgment of
the Company to comply with Applicable Law.

 

(c) Upon the request of Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.18(a)_, the
Company shall prepare, as promptly as practicable, the Notes Offer to
Purchase, together with any required related letters of transmittal and
similar ancillary agreements (such documents, together with all supplements
and amendments thereto, being referred to herein collectively as the " _Notes
Tender Offer Documents_ "), relating to the Notes Tender Offer and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause to be disseminated to the record holders
of the Senior Notes, and to the extent known by the Company, the beneficial
owners of the Senior Notes (collectively, the " _Noteholders_ ") the Notes
Tender Offer Documents; _provided, however_ , that prior to the dissemination
thereof, the Company shall provide copies thereof to Parent not less than ten
(10) Business Days in advance of any such dissemination (or such shorter
period of time as is reasonably practicable in light of when Parent requests
that the Company commence the Notes Tender Offer) and shall consult with
Parent with respect to the Notes Tender Offer Documents and shall include in
such Notes Tender Offer Documents all comments reasonably proposed by Parent
and reasonably acceptable to the Company. Upon request, Parent shall provide
the Company with any information for inclusion in the Notes Tender Offer
Documents which may be required under Applicable Law or reasonably requested
by the Company. If at any time prior to the acceptance of Senior Notes
pursuant to the Notes Tender Offer any event should occur that is required by
Applicable Law to be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the
Notes Tender Offer Documents, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
prepare and disseminate such amendment or supplement; provided that prior to
such dissemination, the Company shall provide copies thereof to Parent not
less than two (2) Business Days (or such shorter period of time as is
reasonably necessary in light of the circumstances) in advance of any
such dissemination and shall consult with Parent with respect to such
amendment or supplement and shall include in such amendment or supplement all

proxies from the Noteholders) have been received, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause an appropriate supplemental indenture (the "
_Supplemental Indenture_ ") to become effective providing for the
amendments of the Senior Notes Indenture contemplated in the Notes Tender
Offer Documents; _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the fact that the
Supplemental Indenture may become effective earlier, the proposed amendments

to such delivery, the Company shall provide copies thereof to Parent not less
than ten (10) Business Days in advance of any such delivery (or such shorter
period of time as is reasonably practicable in light of when Parent requests
that the Company commence the Optional Redemption) and shall consult with
Parent with respect to the Optional Redemption Notice and shall include in
such Optional Redemption Notice all comments reasonably proposed by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company.

approval of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

9.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to
herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto, constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties and their Affiliates with respect to
the subject matter hereof; _provided, however_ , the Confidentiality Agreement
(as amended pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.10_) shall not be superseded, shall
survive any termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and
effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the date
on which the Confidentiality Agreement is terminated in accordance with its
terms.

9.5 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by
the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ and (b) from and after the Effective
Time, the rights of the holders of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger
Consideration and the rights of the holders of Company Compensatory Awards to
receive the consideration contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)_ hereof, in
each case in accordance with _Article_ __ _ II_, this Agreement is not
intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
hereunder; provided that the Financing Parties shall be express third party
beneficiaries of _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, this _Section_ __ _ 8.4_, _Section_ __
_ 9.5_, _Section_ __ _ 9.7(b)_,  _Section_ __ _ 9.10(b)_ and _Section_ __
_ 9.11_, and each of such Sections shall express inure to the benefit of the
Financing Parties.

 



87 9.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

9.7 _Other Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and
the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

 

(b) No Financing Party (i) shall have any liability or obligation to the
parties hereto with respect to this Agreement or with respect to any claim or
cause of action (whether in contract or in tort, in Applicable Law or in
equity or otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited
liability company veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego
or otherwise) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by
reason of, be connected with, or relate to: (A) this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereunder, (B) the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made
in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement), (C) any
breach or violation of this Agreement, and (D) any failure of the
transactions contemplated hereunder to be consummated, it being expressly
agreed and acknowledged by the parties hereto that no personal liability or
losses whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by
any Financing Party, as such, arising under, out of, in connection with or
related to the items in the immediately preceding clauses (A) through (D) or
(ii) shall have any rights or claims against the Company and of
its Subsidiaries, Representatives or shareholders, arising out of this
Agreement, the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or in
connection with the Financing; provided that following the Closing and the
consummation of the Financing, the foregoing will not limit any rights the
Financing Sources have against the Company and its Subsidiaries under the
definitive documentation governing the Financing. For the avoidance of doubt,
this _Section_ __ _ 9.7(b)_ does not limit or affect any rights or remedies
that Parent may have against the parties to the Debt Commitment Letters.

9.8 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage,
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
(including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions

 



88  contemplated by this Agreement) were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to equitable relief without the requirement of
posting a bond or other security, including to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and specific performance and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in
_Section_ __ _ 9.10_, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. The Parties acknowledge that the right
of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would
have entered into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties hereto have an
adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any
party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.8_ shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

 

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the
summons and complaint and any other process in any action or proceeding
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, for and on behalf
of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 9.2_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by Applicable Law, and
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 9.10_ shall affect the right of any party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law; (ii)
irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its
properties and assets in any action or proceeding to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware) in
the event any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger), or for recognition
and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof; (iii) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court; (iv) agrees that any actions or
proceedings arising in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) shall be brought, tried and
determined only in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of
Delaware); (v) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such 

 



89  action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to
plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any action
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Merger) in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any action or
proceeding in such courts as provided above shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Applicable Law.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no party hereto, nor any
of its affiliates, will bring, or support the bringing of, any claim, legal
action or proceeding, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against any Financing Party in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, anywhere
other than in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York
(and the appellate courts thereof), or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and the appellate courts thereof). The
parties hereto further agree to waive and hereby irrevocably waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now have or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any such court and makes the
agreements, waivers and consents set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.10(a)_ above
but with respect to the courts specified in this _Section_ __ _ 9.10(b)_.

 

9.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, COMPANY AND MERGER SUB HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, COMPANY OR MERGER SUB IN
THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF,
INCLUDING ANY CLAIMS OR COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST A FINANCING PARTY.

9.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

2 ARTICLE VI

 

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law,
the Board of Directors of the Corporation is expressly authorized to adopt,
amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation.

ARTICLE VII

 

Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws of the Corporation so require,
the election of directors of the Corporation need not be by written ballot.

ARTICLE VIII

 

A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the directors
duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or
a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or (iv) for any transaction from
which the director derived an improper personal benefit. The limitation of
liability provided herein shall continue after a director has ceased to
occupy such position as to acts or omissions occurring during such directors
term or terms of office.

 



3 ARTICLE XI

 

Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to
or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the
fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal
representative, is or was a director or officer, of the Corporation or is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit
plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official
capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity
while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified
and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may
hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the
extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide
prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including
attorneys fees, judgments, fines, Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended, excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection
therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the
benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators: provided, however,
that, except as provided in paragraph (b) hereof, the Corporation shall
indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding
(or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
The right to indemnification conferred in this Section shall be a contract
right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses
incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition:
provided, however, that, if the General Corporation Law of the State of 

 



4  Delaware requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or
officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other
capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director
or officer, including without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan)
in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon
delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such
director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately
be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified
under this Section or otherwise. The Corporation may, by action of its
Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the
Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of
directors and officers.

 

If a claim under paragraph (a) of this Section is not paid in full by the
Corporation within thirty days after a written claim has been received by the
Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the
Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in
whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense
of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other
than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending
any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required
undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that
the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which makes it permissible
under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the Corporation
to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving
such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the
Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or
its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of
such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the
circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in the General Corporation Law of the State 

 



5  of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its
Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the
claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense
to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the
applicable standard of conduct.

 

The right to the indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in
defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this
Section shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or
hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise.
