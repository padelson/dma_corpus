                              PURCHASE AND SALE
                              -----------------

         2.1.     THE INTERESTS.

         On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at Closing, Sellers shall sell and deliver the Interests to Buyer
and Buyer shall purchase and accept the Interests from Sellers.

         2.2.     PURCHASE PRICE; MANNER OF PAYMENT; FUNDING OF COMPANY
OBLIGATIONS.

         (a)      The aggregate purchase price for the Interests ("Purchase
Price") shall be an amount equal to the difference between: (i) the sum of
(x) One Hundred Fifty Million Five Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars
($150,525,000), and (y) the aggregate amount of the Earn Out (if any) that
is payable pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(iii) up to the Maximum Earn Out
Amount; less (ii) the sum of (x) the amount of the Additional Repurchase
Payment that is payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and (y) the aggregate
amount of the Employee Bonus

                                     6


Obligations (the sum total of this clause (ii) being hereinafter sometimes
collectively referred to as the "Company Funded Obligations"). The Purchase
Price is further subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.7 and 2.8
hereof.

         (b)      The Purchase Price shall be payable in the following manner:

                  (i)      That portion of the Purchase Price that equals the
difference between One Hundred Thirty-Eight Million Five Hundred Twenty-Five
Thousand Dollars ($138,525,000) less the aggregate amount of the Company
Funded Obligations (the "Closing Payment") shall be paid at Closing to
Sellers in accordance with the payment instructions specified on Schedule
                                                                 --------
2.2(b)(i), which Company and the Sellers each confirm comply with the terms
---------
of the Second Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of Spacelink
International, LLC, dated December 30, 2003 and effective January 1, 2003
(the "Operating Agreement Distribution Formula"). The Closing Payment will
be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to
wiring instructions furnished by Sellers; and

                  (ii)     Twelve Million Dollars ($12,000,000) of the Purchase
Price shall be payable by the issuance to Sellers in accordance with the
Operating Agreement Distribution Formula of 228,292 shares of unregistered
Buyer common stock, par value $.01 per share (which number of Shares is
based upon the average closing price of a share of such Buyer common stock
as reported by the NASDAQ National Market System for the thirty (30)
immediately preceding trading days ending on the third (3rd) trading day
preceding the date of this Agreement) ("ESSI Stock"). The ESSI Stock will be
restricted shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933
Act"). All certificates for the ESSI Stock shall bear the following or a
substantially similar legend:

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE STATE
SECURITIES LAW. NO SALE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THESE SECURITIES MAY BE EFFECTED
WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATED THERETO OR AN OPINION OF
COUNSEL OR CERTIFICATE IN A FORM SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER THAT SUCH
REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED,
OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAW."

The certificates for the ESSI Stock may also bear any legend required by any
applicable state securities or other Law. In addition, the Buyer shall make
or cause to be made a notation regarding the restrictions on transfer of the
ESSI Stock in the stock transfer records maintained by it or its transfer
agent and the ESSI Stock shall be transferred on the books of Buyer or its
transfer agent, as applicable, only if transferred or sold pursuant to an
effective registration statement or an applicable exemption under the 1933
Act or under any applicable state securities Law covering such shares or
such sale. At Closing, Buyer and Sellers will enter into a Registration
Rights Agreement in the form of Exhibit G providing Sellers piggyback
                                ---------
registration rights with respect to the ESSI Stock (the "Registration Rights
Agreement").

                  (iii)    The Earn Out portion of the Purchase Price is earned
and payable in the following manner:

                           (A)    To the extent that the product of EBITDA for
the period beginning on February 1, 2005 and ending on January 31, 2006
multiplied by 6.67 exceeds $150,525,000,

                                     7


Buyer shall pay to the Sellers (or their successors) in cash, in accordance
with the Operating Agreement Distribution Formula, the amount of such excess
(subject to Clause E, below) on or before April 30, 2006 (the "First Earn
Out Payment");

                           (B)    To the extent that the product of EBITDA for
the period commencing February 1, 2006 and ending January 31, 2007
multiplied by 5.71 exceeds the sum of $150,525,000 plus the amount of the
First Earn Out Payment, Buyer will pay to the Sellers in cash, in accordance
with the Operating Agreement Distribution Formula, the amount of such excess
(subject to Clause E, below) on or before April 30, 2007 (the "Second Earn
Out Payment");

                           (C)    Within sixty (60) days following the close of
each period set forth in Sections 2.2(b)(iii)(A) and 2.2(b)(iii)(B) (each an
"Earn Out Period"), Buyer shall furnish the Sellers with a calculation in
reasonable detail of EBITDA for such Earn Out Period and a calculation of
the relevant Earn Out portion of the Purchase Price. The Sellers and their
representatives shall have the rights to inspect the Company's and Buyer's
books and records relevant to such calculations and determinations during
normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company and/or
Buyer prior to a final resolution of these matters and Buyer shall provide
reasonable access to and copies of the relevant financial statements and
records of Buyer and the Company for such purposes. Within thirty (30) days
of receiving such calculations, the Sellers may dispute such calculations in
a written notice to Buyer. In the event that the Sellers shall dispute such
calculations, Buyer shall promptly provide payment to the Sellers, in
accordance with the Operating Agreement Distribution Formula, of the
non-disputed amount on or before the due date(s) therefor and the matter
will be submitted to an Arbitrator in accordance with the provisions of
Section 2.2(b)(iii)(D) below, whose determination shall be final and
binding. If the Sellers fail to dispute Buyer's calculations within such
thirty (30) day period, Buyer's calculations shall be final and binding and
may not be further disputed or contested. All amounts due and payable to the
Sellers pursuant to this Section 2.2(b)(iii) shall be deemed to be
additional consideration for all of the Sellers' Interests;

                           (D)    In the event that the Sellers and Buyer are
unable to agree on a joint determination of EBITDA and the Earn Out portion
of the Purchase Price, then within ten (10) days of the dispute asserted by
the Sellers pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(iii)(C) above, the disputed amount
will be submitted for final binding resolution to an Arbitrator. The parties
agree to request that the Arbitrator render its determination prior to the
expiration of sixty (60) days after such submission. The costs of such
Arbitrator's review shall be borne by the Sellers and Buyer in proportion to
their relative success in the determination of the Earn Out portion of the
Purchase Price in dispute. For example, if the Sellers claim that the First
Earn Out Payment was only $100,000 less than it should have been and the
Arbitrator determines that the First Earn Out Payment was $10,000 less than
it should have been, then Buyer would bear 10% of the costs of such
Arbitrator's review and the Sellers would bear 90% of such costs; and

                           (E)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the aggregate amount of the First Earn Out Payment and the Second
Earn Out Payment shall not exceed the Maximum Earn Out Amount.

         (c)      At Closing, Buyer will pay or cause to be paid to FHF Holding,
L.L.C. the amount of the Additional Contingent Consideration (as that term
is defined in the Repurchase Agreement) that is owing to FHF Holding, L.L.C.
under the Repurchase Agreement by reason of

                                     8


the transactions contemplated under this Agreement (the "Additional
Repurchase Payment"). At Closing, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a
payoff document executed by FHF Holding, L.L.C. that provides wiring
instructions for the payment of the Additional Repurchase Payment and also
provides for the release of the Company of any further obligations under the
Repurchase Agreement contingent only upon its receipt of the Additional
Repurchase Payment.

         (d)      Buyer will pay or cause the Company to pay, when due in
accordance with the provisions of Section 7.12 hereof, the aggregate amount
of the Employee Bonuses.

         2.3.     CLOSING.

         The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
("Closing") shall take place at the offices of Womble Carlyle Sandridge &
Rice PLLC, 8065 Leesburg Pike, Fourth Floor, Vienna, VA 22182, or at such
other place as the Parties may mutually agree. The Closing shall occur on
February 1, 2005 (the "Closing Date"), or on such other date as may be
agreed by the Parties in writing. The Closing shall be effective as of 12:01
a.m. on the Closing Date.

         2.4.     DELIVERIES OF THE COMPANY AND SELLERS AT CLOSING.

         Subject to the conditions to Sellers' obligations in Article VI, at
Closing, the Company and Sellers, as applicable, shall deliver or cause to
be delivered to Buyer

         (a)      all of the certificates evidencing the Interests, each duly
endorsed for transfer to Buyer or accompanied by an assignment of interests
separate from the certificate duly executed in blank (or if no certificates
evidencing the Interests exist, then the Sellers shall deliver assignments
of membership interests in form(s) reasonably acceptable to Buyer's
counsel), and

         (b)      all of the certificates, resignations, agreements, documents
and other instruments set forth in Article V hereof.

         2.5.     DELIVERIES OF BUYER AT CLOSING.

         Subject to the conditions to Buyer's obligations in Article V, at
Closing, Buyer shall (a) make the payments and deliver the certificates
evidencing the ESSI Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(b) hereof, and

         (b)      deliver to the Sellers all of the certificates, agreements,
documents and other instruments set forth in Article VI hereof.

         2.6.     CLOSING BALANCE SHEET.

         (a)      As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, but
in no event later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date
(although the failure to meet such deadline shall not result in a penalty or
loss), Buyer shall cause to be prepared, at Buyer's expense and in good
faith, and submit to Sellers an audited balance sheet of the Company as of
the opening of business on the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet").
The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared by Cherry, Bekaert & Holland,
L.L.P. (the "Accountant") in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles consistent in all respects (including, without limitation,
classification and presentation of line items) with past practices, so long
as such practices have been in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles (the "Accounting Principles"), provided, that the Closing Balance
Sheet shall not include or reflect any impact from the (i) Excluded Assets,
(ii) Excluded Liabilities, (iii) any impact that might otherwise result from
the

                                     9


allocation of the Purchase Price under Sections 2.8 and 7.9, (iv) the
Defined Benefit Plan, and (v) any related Income Tax effect as a result of
any of the foregoing.

         (b)      In the event Sellers dispute the Closing Balance Sheet as
delivered by Buyer, Sellers shall provide written notice (a "Notice of
Dispute") specifying in reasonable detail all points of disagreement with
the Closing Balance Sheet to Buyer within thirty (30) days after receipt of
the Closing Balance Sheet. If Sellers fail to deliver a Notice of Dispute
within such 30-day period, then the Closing Balance Sheet as delivered by
Buyer shall be used for purposes of Section 2.7. If Sellers deliver a Notice
of Dispute within such 30-day period, Buyer and Sellers shall endeavor in
good faith to resolve all specified points of disagreement within thirty
(30) days after Seller's receipt of Buyer's Notice of Dispute. If the
dispute is not resolved within such 30-day period, Buyer or the Sellers may
refer the dispute for arbitration to a partner in a firm of independent
public accountants who employ in excess of one hundred (100) certified
public accountants (which firm shall not then have, nor within the past
three (3) years have had, any relationship with Buyer or its Affiliates or
the Sellers or their Affiliates) as shall be mutually acceptable to Buyer
and the Sellers (the "Arbitrator"), as arbitrator to finally determine, as
soon as practicable, all points of disagreement with respect to the Closing
Balance Sheet. For purposes of such arbitration, each Party shall submit a
proposed Closing Balance Sheet to the Arbitrator and to the other Party,
accompanied by such additional information explaining such Party's position
with respect to the Closing Balance Sheet as it (they) desires to submit.
Each Party shall, at the time of such submission, be free to revise
positions they have maintained in prior drafts of the Closing Balance Sheet
and related discussions, but the Parties shall not be permitted to further
modify their proposed Closing Balance Sheet once these are submitted to the
Arbitrator. Buyer shall submit any revised Closing Balance Sheet no later
than twenty (20) days after such referral. Sellers shall have thirty (30)
days after such referral to submit their revised Closing Balance Sheet in
response. The Arbitrator shall apply the terms of this Section 2.6, and
shall otherwise conduct the arbitration under such procedures as the Parties
may agree or, failing such agreement, under the Commercial Arbitration Rules
of the American Arbitration Association. The fees and expenses of the
arbitration and the Arbitrator incurred in connection with the arbitration
of the Closing Balance Sheet shall be allocated between the Parties by the
Arbitrator in proportion to the extent either Party did not prevail on the
points of disagreement in the Closing Balance Sheet; provided, that such
fees and expenses shall not include, so long as a Party complies with the
procedures of this Section 2.6, the other Party's outside counsel or
accounting fees. All determinations by the Arbitrator shall be final,
conclusive and binding with respect to the Closing Balance Sheet and the
allocation of arbitration fees and expenses.

         (c)      Buyer agrees to cooperate with Sellers in attempting to
resolve any points of disagreement referred to in Section 2.6(b), including
without limitation, making reasonably available to Sellers to the extent
reasonably requested all books, records, work papers and personnel;
provided, however, that Sellers will conduct their work in a manner that
does not unreasonably interfere with or disrupt the conduct of the Business
by the Company after the Closing.

         2.7.     ADJUSTMENT TO PURCHASE PRICE.

         (a)      The Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward or downward,
dollar for dollar, in the event the Company's Net Working Capital as
reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet as finally determined (by agreement
or otherwise) in accordance with Section 2.6 is greater than or less than
$10,100,000.

                                     10


         (b)      In the event subparagraph (a) of this Section 7 results in a
downward adjustment in the Purchase Price, then Sellers shall pay to Buyer
the amount of any such Purchase Price downward adjustment, on a dollar for
dollar basis, that may be owing to Buyer under this Section 2.7 within five
(5) business days after the amount of the adjustment has been finally
determined. In the event subparagraph (a) of this Section 7 results in an
upward adjustment in the Purchase Price, then Buyer shall pay to Sellers in
accordance with the Operating Agreement Distribution Formula the amount of
any such Purchase Price upward adjustment, on a dollar for dollar basis,
that may be owing to Sellers under this Section 2.7 within five (5) business
days after the amount of the adjustment has been finally determined.

         2.8.     ORDINARY INCOME TAX PRICE INCREASE.

         (a)      The Parties intend that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall constitute an asset purchase and sale for Income Tax
purposes consistent with Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 99-6. As
additional consideration for the purchase of the Interests under this
Agreement, Buyer shall pay to each of the Sellers such amount as is required
to compensate each Seller for any incremental federal, state or local Income
Taxes due to the allocation of Purchase Price hereafter described in Section
7.9(b) to the extent such allocation results in ordinary income or short
term capital gain rather than long term capital gain to a Seller (the
"Ordinary Income Tax Price Increase"). The Parties agree that the amount of
any Ordinary Income Tax Price Increase shall be deemed to be an upward
adjustment in the amount of the Purchase Price.

         (b)      The Ordinary Income Tax Price Increase shall be determined
and be paid pursuant to the procedures provided in Section 7.9.

         (c)      The Ordinary Income Tax Price Increase shall be equal to the
sum of:

                  (i)      The differential in Taxes imposed on each Seller
(and, if a Seller is a pass-through entity for Tax purposes, on each
ultimate owner of such Seller as specified on Schedule 2.8) to the extent
                                              ------------
the allocation of the Purchase Price results in the realization of ordinary
income or short term capital gain rather than long-term capital gain (the
"OI Indemnity Payment"); and

                  (ii)     An additional amount such that the sum of the
additional amount and the OI Indemnity Payment, minus the Taxes payable by
each Seller (and, if a Seller is a pass-through entity for Tax purposes, by
each ultimate owner of such Seller as specified on Schedule 2.8) on the
                                                   ------------
receipt or accrual of such sum, is equal to the OI Indemnity Payment.

         (d)      The Ordinary Income Tax Price Increase shall be computed
using the following assumptions:

                  (i)      Each Seller would have recognized long-term capital
gain and no ordinary income or short term capital gain on the sale of its
Interests; and

                  (ii)     Each Seller would incur Income Tax liability at the
highest marginal federal, state and local Income Tax rate applicable to
ordinary income, short term capital gain or long-term capital gains, as the
case may be (determined in the case of income or gain from the sale of the
Interests by reference to the state of residence of each Seller or its
individual owner(s), as applicable, as specified on Schedule 2.8) and, in
                                                    ------------
the case of income reportable as income by such Seller or its individual
owner(s) in taxing jurisdictions other than its state of

                                     11


residence, at the maximum marginal rate applicable in each state and local
taxing jurisdiction to which such income is allocable or apportionable.

         (e)      In the event either or both of the Sellers are pass-through
entities for Income Tax purposes, then the calculation of the Ordinary
Income Tax Price Increase shall be made in the case of individual natural
person owners of such entities on the basis of the Income Tax rates
applicable to said individual natural person owners (based on the states of
residence of such owners as specified on Schedule 2.8) to the extent of
                                         ------------
their proportionate ownership of such Sellers. In the event that any owner
of a pass-through entity Seller is not subject to federal and/or state
income taxation, then notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
Ordinary Income Tax Price Increase shall be due and owing from Buyer to
Seller to the extent of such non-taxable owner's proportionate ownership of
either Seller.

         2.9.     EXCLUDED ASSETS; EXCLUDED LIABILITIES.

         (a)      Prior to the Closing, pursuant to an assignment and assumption

failure to so qualify would not result in a material liability to the
Company or materially impair or hinder the Company's operations after the
Closing. Schedule 3.3 hereto sets forth the jurisdictions in which the
         ------------
Company is qualified as a foreign limited liability company. The Company has

statement for the ten (10) month period then ended (including the detail
provided therefrom) (collectively, the "Interim Financial Statements").

         (b)      The Financial Statements:

                  (i)      were derived from and prepared in accordance with
the books and records of the Company,

                  (ii)     are true, correct and complete in all material
respects and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position and results of operations of the Company at the dates and for the
periods indicated. The information reflected in the Financial Statements was
prepared

                                     14


in accordance with the Accounting Principles (except, in the case of the
Interim Financial Statements, for the absence of year-end adjustments and
footnote disclosure), and

                  (iii)    disclose all of the assets and reflect or reserve
against all liabilities (whether fixed or contingent) of the Company as of
the dates of such Financial Statements (other than assets or liabilities

                ---------------
Projections present the Company's expected results of operations for the
projection period. They reflect conditions the Company expects to exist and

those differences may be material. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.15(a),

                  (v)      To the knowledge of the Company, no current or former
employee of the Company has any valid claim against the Company on account
of or for

                           (A)    overtime pay, other than overtime pay for the
current payroll period,

                           (B)    wages or salary (excluding current bonus,
accruals and amounts accruing under pension and profit-sharing plans) for
any period other than the current payroll period,

                           (C)    vacation, time off or pay in lieu of vacation

                  ----------------
with their respective job titles, dates of employment, current rates of

respects with all applicable Laws respecting employment and employment
practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours, and there
is no charge or complaint actually pending or to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company before the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission or the Department of Labor, or any state or local

Plan").

         (b)      Each Company Plan has been administered in material
compliance with its terms and, to the extent applicable, with ERISA or other
Law applicable to any Company Plan. Each Company Plan that is intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) or Section 501(c)(9) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (a copy of
which has been provided to Buyer) and related trusts have been determined to
be exempt from taxation. Nothing has occurred that would cause and no action

Company, could result in the loss of such exemption or qualification except
for amendments required by Law for which the remedial amendment period
remains open.

         (c)      No Company Plan is a multi-employer plan (as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA) and the Company has not contributed to nor ever has
been obligated to contribute to any multi-employer plan.

statutory or administrative exemption does not exist with respect to

                                     26


any Company Plan and which would result in a material liability to the
Company. No reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA
(other than those for which reporting is waived) has occurred with respect
to any Company Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA. With respect to each
Company Plan, all payments due from the Company to date have been made and
all amounts properly accrued to date as liabilities of Company which have
not been paid have been properly recorded on the books of the Company and
are reflected on the Interim Balance Sheet.

         (e)      Except as specified on Schedule 3.18(e), no Company Plan
                                         ----------------
provides benefits at the expense of the Company, including, without
limitation, death or medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect

the Code or other Law;

                  (ii)     death or pension benefits under any Company Plan

insurance pursuant to the terms of an insurance contract under a Company
Plan.

         (f)      Except as set forth on Schedule 3.18(d), to the Company's
                                         ----------------
knowledge, there has been no act or omission by Company with regard to the
Company Plans that has given rise to any fines, penalties, taxes or related
charges under Section 502(c) of ERISA or Chapter 43 of the Code.

         (g)      Except as set forth on Schedule 3.18(g), neither the
                                         ----------------
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with
any other event) (i) result in any severance, termination, golden parachute
or other payment becoming due to any former or current employee of the
Company or any of its Affiliates or cause an increase in the amount of
compensation due to any such employee or former employee; or (ii) increase
or affect the calculation of the amount of any benefits otherwise payable
under any Company Plan or result in any acceleration of the time of payment
or vesting of any such benefits.

         3.19.    PRODUCT LIABILITY.

         Except as described on Schedule 3.19, no material claim or
                                -------------

other agreements herein contemplated to be executed by the Sellers
constitute (or upon execution will constitute) valid and binding obligations
of the Sellers, enforceable against the Sellers in accordance with their
respective terms, subject to Bankruptcy Laws and Equitable Principles.

         (b)      The Interests constitute the only ownership interests of the
Company. The Sellers are the record (and beneficial) owners of all of the
Interests (with the ownership being as reflected on Schedule 3.2), free and
                                                    ------------

         (c)      Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by each Seller will (i)
violate or conflict with any provisions of the articles of incorporation,
certificate of formation , bylaws, operating agreement or other governing
documents of either of the Sellers, (ii) result in a breach of any of the
terms or provisions of, or constitute a violation or default under, or
conflict with any Law applicable to such Seller or any judgment, decree,
order or award of any court, governmental body or arbitrator to which such
Seller is a party or may be bound, or (ii) except as otherwise expressly
disclosed in this Agreement or on any of the Schedules hereto, violate, or
be in conflict with, or constitute a default under, or result in the
termination of, accelerate the performance required by, or cause the
acceleration of the maturity of any material liability or obligation, or
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon the Interests under
any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease,
contract, commitment, understanding, or other agreement to which such Seller
is a party or to which such Seller may be bound or affected or to which the
Interests or may be subject. Neither Seller (nor any of their respective
owners, officers, directors,

                                     30


managers or Affiliates) has any claim against the Company, for whatever
reason, either as a member, manager, officer, employee or otherwise, and
after the Closing, neither the Company nor the Buyer shall have any further
obligations owing to the Sellers (nor any of their respective owners,
officers, directors, managers or Affiliates), except to the extent expressly
provided in this Agreement, or as otherwise agreed to in writing after the
Closing between either of the Sellers (or any of their respective owners,
officers, directors, managers or Affiliates) and the Company and/or the
Buyer.

          (d)     Each Seller hereby confirms that the ESSI Stock acquired
hereunder will be acquired for investment for Seller's own account, not as a
nominee or agent, and not with a view to the sale or distribution of any
part thereof, and that such Seller has no present intention of selling,
granting participation in, or otherwise distributing the same. By executing
this Agreement, each Seller further represents that such Seller does not
have any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any Person to
sell, transfer or grant participations to such Person or to any third party,
with respect to any of the ESSI Stock.

          (e)     Each Seller understands that the ESSI Stock has not been
registered under the 1933 Act or under any applicable state securities Law,
on the ground that the sale provided for in this Agreement and the issuance
of ESSI Stock hereunder is exempt from registration under the 1933 Act and
that the Buyer's reliance on such exemption is predicated, in part, on such
Seller's representations set forth herein.

          (f)     Each Seller represents that it (and each of its owners) is an
"accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D under
the 1933 Act and that such Seller (and each of its owners) is experienced in
evaluating the merits and risks of investing in companies such as the Buyer,
has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to
be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of their investment in ESSI
Stock and has the ability to bear the economic risks of their investment.
Each Seller further represents that such Seller (and each of its owners) has
had access, during the course of the transaction and prior to their
acquisition of ESSI Stock hereunder, to the same kind of information that
would be provided in a registration statement filed by the Buyer under the
1933 Act and that such Seller (and each of its owners) has had, during the
course of the transaction and prior to entering in to this Agreement, the
opportunity to ask questions of, and receive answers from, the Buyer
concerning the current business operations and financial condition of the
Buyer and to obtain such additional information as the Sellers deemed
necessary to verify the accuracy of any information furnished or to which
access was provided to the Sellers (or their owners).

         (g)      Each Seller understands that the ESSI Stock or any interest
therein may not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of without
registration under the 1933 Act or under any applicable state securities Law
or an exemption therefrom, and that in the absence of an effective
registration statement covering the ESSI Stock or an available exemption
from registration under the 1933 Act and any applicable state securities
Law, the ESSI Stock must be held indefinitely. In particular, each Seller is
aware that the ESSI Stock may not be sold pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated
under the 1933 Act unless all of the conditions of that Rule, including
applicable holding period, manner of sale and notice filing requirements,
are met.

                                     31

such acts and execute such documents and instruments as may be reasonably
requested by the other Party to make effective the transactions contemplated
hereby. In the event that consents, approvals or other authorizations or
other acts contemplated by this Agreement have not been fully effected as of
Closing, the Parties will continue after the Closing, without further
consideration, to use their reasonable best efforts to carry out such
transactions; provided, however, in the event that certain approvals,
consents or other necessary documentation cannot be secured, then the Party
having legal responsibility, ownership or other control shall act on behalf
of the other Party, without further consideration, to effect the essential
intention of the Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

         7.7.     KNOWLEDGE OF BREACH; CURRENT INFORMATION.

         Each Party shall advise the other Parties in writing promptly after
obtaining knowledge thereof (and in any event prior to the Closing) of (i)
the occurrence of any event which renders any of such Party's
representations or warranties set forth herein inaccurate in any material
respect or the awareness of such Party that any representation or warranty
set forth herein was not accurate in all material respects when made; and
(ii) the failure of such Party to comply with or accomplish any of the
covenants or agreements set forth herein in any material respect. Between
the date hereof and the Closing Date, Sellers will also cause the Company to
provide Buyer promptly on becoming available copies of all operating reports
and financial statements prepared by or for the Company. If any of the
information disclosed on any of the Schedules of a Party hereto is (or
becomes) incorrect, such Party shall prepare and deliver to the other
Parties updated Schedules promptly after discovering same and prior to the
Closing. If any matter arises after the date hereof which, had such matter
existed or occurred on or prior to the date hereof, would have been required
to have been disclosed on a Party's Schedules hereto, such Party shall
prepare and deliver to the other Parties supplemental Schedules prior to
Closing. Any updated or supplemental Schedules delivered pursuant to this

                                     40

<PAGE>
delivering Party's Schedules hereto, but shall not be effective for the
purposes of Sections 5.1 or 6.1 hereof.

         7.8.     TAX MATTERS.

         (a)      Sellers will cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax
Returns (including final returns) for the Company that are due after
the Closing Date for taxable periods which end on or before the Closing
Date. Sellers will pay, or caused to be paid, all Taxes required to
be paid with respect to such Tax Returns (unless otherwise accrued
for on the Closing Balance Sheet), provided that such payment
obligation shall not limit Seller's rights pursuant to Section 2.8
of this Agreement. Sellers will be responsible for reporting and
paying the Taxes due for any income passed through to them for any
taxable period of the Company that ends (or ended) on or before the
Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Period") by reason of the
Company's partnership Tax status prior to the Closing. Buyer will
cause the Company to prepare and file all Tax Returns for taxable
periods ending after the Closing Date.

         (b)      With respect to any taxable period that would otherwise
include but not end on the Closing Date, to the extent permissible
pursuant to applicable Law, Sellers will, and Buyer will cause the
Company to, take all steps as are or may be reasonably necessary,
including, without limitation, the filing of elections or returns
with applicable taxing authorities, to cause such period to end on
the Closing Date. In any case where applicable Law does not permit
the Company to close its taxable year on the Closing Date, then
Taxes, if any, attributable to the taxable period of the Company
that includes the Closing Date shall be allocated to Sellers for
that portion of the taxable period up to and including the Closing
Date and to the Buyer for that portion of the taxable period
subsequent to the Closing Date and the Sellers and Buyer shall each
be responsible for reporting and paying the Taxes due for any such
Tax liability (except, in the case of the Sellers, for any Tax
liability accrued on the Closing Balance Sheet) allocated to them.
Sellers shall have access to such information as Sellers may
reasonably request (including access to books, records and
personnel) pursuant to Section 7.2(b) in order for the operations
of the Company to be properly reported in Tax Returns, for the
preparation for any Tax audit or for the prosecution or defense of
any claims, suit or proceeding relating to Taxes for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period and to determine any allocation of income
between Buyer and the Sellers pursuant to this Section 7.8(b).

         (c)      With respect to any Tax Return of the Company proposed
to be filed by Sellers after the Closing Date for a taxable period that
ends on or before the Closing Date, Sellers shall provide Buyer and
its authorized representatives with copies of such completed Tax
Return at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for the
filing of such Tax Return, and Buyer and its authorized
representatives shall have the right to review such Tax Return
prior to the filing thereof.

         (d)      Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate as and to the extent
reasonably requested by any other Party hereto, in connection with
the preparation and filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation
or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon another party's request) the
provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant
to any such Tax Return, audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Sellers and Buyer agree (i) to retain all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company
relating to any taxable period beginning before

                            41

<PAGE>
the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations
of the respective taxable periods, and (ii) to give any other party
reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so
requests, Buyer or Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the
other party to take possession of such books and records.

         7.9.     ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE; ORDINARY INCOME TAX PRICE
INCREASE COMPUTATION.

         (a)      For Tax purposes, Sellers will report the purchase of
Interests as a liquidation due to partnership termination followed by
a sale of assets of the Company. Each Seller shall include any income,
gain, loss, deduction or other tax items for the taxable period ending
on the Closing Date on such Seller's Tax Returns in a manner consistent
with the Form K-1s (or their equivalent) prepared in accordance with
this Section 7.9.

         (b)      The Sellers and the Buyer shall use their best efforts to
mutually agree upon the initial determination of the allocation among the
assets of the Company of the Purchase Price no later than thirty (30) days
after the final determination (by agreement or otherwise) of the Closing
Balance Sheet in accordance with Section 2.6. Such allocation shall be made
in accordance with the applicable sections of the Code and the regulations
thereunder. If Buyer and each of the Sellers are unable to agree upon such
determination or allocation within such time period, then such determination
and allocation shall be made by the Accountant pursuant to Section 7.9(g)
below. When finally determined hereunder (whether by agreement or otherwise)
such asset allocation shall be binding upon each of the Sellers and the
Buyer for all purposes (including accounting purposes, financial and
regulatory reporting purposes and Tax purposes) and the Parties each agree
to follow such asset allocation for their respective Income Tax reporting of
the consequences of the transactions contemplated hereunder.

         (c)      At least sixty (60) days prior to the latest permissible date
for filing the Sellers' Tax Returns which include the taxable period ending
on the Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver copies of their Tax Returns to
Buyer for its review.

         (d)      Each of the Sellers and the Buyer shall comply fully with all
filing and other requirements and agree to cooperate in good faith with each
other in the preparation and timely filing of any Tax Returns.

         (e)      No later than thirty (30) days after a final determination of
the matters described in Section 7.9(b), Buyer shall cause the Accountant to
prepare initial computations of the Ordinary Income Tax Price Increase and
deliver them to the Sellers. Such initial computations shall be final and
binding on all of the Parties, unless a notice of disputed items is
delivered by Sellers to Buyer within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the
computations from Buyer ( in which event the provisions of Section 7.9(g)
shall apply), or until and unless revised by a later recomputation by the
Accountant. Buyer shall pay to each of the Sellers their respective amounts
of the initial computation of the Ordinary Income Tax Price Increase within
five (5) business days of the earlier of (i) the expiration of the thirty
(30) day period following receipt of the initial computations or (ii) the
date on which the Sellers accept in writing such computations.

         (f)      The Buyer promptly shall cause the Accountant to prepare a
recomputation of the Ordinary Income Tax Price Increase upon notice to Buyer
that such a recomputation is necessary to reflect a change to the Tax
liability incurred by the Sellers by reason of a redetermination by a taxing
authority of the amount of ordinary income or short term capital gain
realized by the

                                   42

Sellers from the receipt of the Purchase Price or the Ordinary Income Tax
Price Increase that is inconsistent with the most recent computations.
Subsequent payments between the Parties as a result of any subsequent
adjustments to the Ordinary Income Tax Price Increase amount shall be
made within five (5) business days after the date that a revised computation
of the Ordinary Income Tax Price Increase is determined by the
Accountant and provided to the Parties.

         (g)      If there shall be a dispute between the Parties regarding any
matters concerning the allocation of the Purchase Price or the Ordinary
Income Tax Price Increase computations contemplated by Section 2.8 and this
Section 7.9, and the dispute is not resolved within the 20-day period after
such dispute arises, the dispute shall be referred to the Accountant. The
Accountant shall finally determine, as soon as practicable, all points of
disagreement with respect to the submitted matter. Buyer shall submit any
statement of its position to the Accountant no later than seven (7) days
after such referral. Sellers shall have fourteen (14) days after such
referral to submit their proposed revision of the position urged by the
Buyer. The Accountant shall apply the terms of Section 2.8 and this Section
7.9, and shall render a decision within twenty-five (25) days after the
matter is referred to the Accountant. Any payments from Buyer to the Sellers
or from the Sellers to Buyer required by this Section 7.9(g) shall be made
within five (5) business days after the Accountant renders its decision. The
fees and expenses of the Accountant shall be allocated between and paid by
the Parties in proportion to the extent either Party did not prevail on the
points of disagreement.

         7.10.    CERTAIN LIABILITIES; TRANSFERS.

         Prior to the Closing, the Company and the Sellers shall take all
action as is necessary to cause any notes or receivables due to the Company
from the Sellers or the Company's officers or managers to be cancelled or
otherwise extinguished. Further, the Company and the Sellers agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts prior to the Closing to do all such acts and
undertakings as are necessary to cause title to the Excluded Assets to be
transferred to the Sellers and to cause the Company to be released from any
and all liabilities, obligations and Liens related to the Excluded
Liabilities.

         7.11.    DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN.

         Effective January 23, 2001, the Company amended its
non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan ("Defined Benefit Plan"),
closing such plan to future participants and ceasing the accrual of non-top
heavy benefits for existing participants. Between the date of this Agreement
and Closing, the Sellers will endeavor to cause the Company to pay out in
cash ("DB Payout") any and all existing employee obligations under the
Defined Benefit Plan as indicated on Schedule 7.11. In the event that the DB
                                     -------------
Payout does not occur prior to Closing and the Defined Benefit Plan's assets
are less than its liabilities at the time of the DB Payout, the Sellers will
remit in cash the amount of such deficiency to the Buyer within thirty (30)
days of the DB Payout. In the event that the Defined Benefit Plan's assets
exceed its liabilities at the time of the DB Payout, the Buyer will remit
(or cause to be remitted) in cash the amount of such excess to the Sellers
in accordance with the Operating Agreement Distribution Formula within
thirty (30) days of the DB Payout.

         7.12.    EMPLOYEE BONUSES.

         Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall determine the amount
of bonuses that will be awarded to certain employees of the Company in
recognition of their efforts on behalf of the

                                    43

Company prior to the Closing Date (the "Employee Bonuses"). The amount of
the Employee Bonuses allocated to each designated employee will be payable
by the Company on the first (1st) anniversary date of the Closing Date.
All such payments shall be subject to customary withholding. The Employee
Bonuses will be submitted to the Management Committee of the Company and
the Sellers for requisite manager and member approval prior to the Closing,
and certified copies of such resolutions approving the Employee Bonuses shall
be provided to Buyer at Closing. Buyer covenants and agrees that the payment
of the Employee Bonuses will remain an obligation of the Company following
the Closing Date and Buyer covenants and agrees to pay or cause the Company
to make the payment of the Employee Bonuses in accordance with the terms
hereof.

         7.13.    COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.

         With respect to all of the billed accounts receivable of the
Company existing as of the Closing (collectively the "Accounts Receivable"),
the Company shall use commercially reasonable collection efforts in order to
attempt to collect all of such Accounts Receivable within one (1) year of
the Closing Date. If any of the Accounts Receivable (net of the allowance
for doubtful accounts established on the Closing Balance Sheet) have not
been collected by the Company by the first anniversary date of the Closing
Date (the "Uncollected Receivables"), then the Sellers shall be liable to
Buyer for the amount of any such Uncollected Receivables to the extent that
they are in excess of the allowance for doubtful accounts established on the
Closing Balance Sheet. In such event, the Sellers shall pay to the Buyer the
difference between the aggregate amount of the Uncollected Receivables less
the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts established on the Closing
Balance Sheet. After such payment by the Sellers to the Buyer, if the
Company subsequently receives payment on an Uncollected Receivable after the
Sellers have paid Buyer for same, Buyer will cause the Company to promptly
remit to the Sellers in accordance with the Operating Agreement Distribution
Formula the amount of any such payment received.

                                ARTICLE VIII.

                               INDEMNIFICATION
                               ---------------

         8.1.     INDEMNIFICATION BY SELLERS.

         Subject to the limitations of Section 8.2 below, from and after the
Closing the Sellers, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Buyer and the Company and each of their respective Affiliates
and the directors, officers, employees, successors, permitted assigns and
agents of each of them (the "Buyer Indemnified Persons") against all
liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses reasonably and actually
incurred by them as a result of:

         (a)      Any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or non-fulfillment
of any agreement or covenant on the part of the Company (other than covenants
and agreements to be performed by the Company after the Closing) or Sellers
under this Agreement, or any misrepresentation in any certificate or other
instrument furnished or to be furnished by the Company or Sellers to the
Buyer under this Agreement;

         (b)      Any of the Excluded Liabilities;

                                      44


         (c)      Any inaccuracy in the disclosures set forth on Schedule 3.2;
                                                                 ------------

         (d)      Any liabilities or obligations relating to the Defined Benefit
Plan (not addressed under Section 7.11) or the closure thereof (including
without limitation, the failure of the Defined Benefit Plan to be in
compliance with applicable Laws or the failure of the Defined Benefit Plan
to have sufficient assets to make the requisite payout to existing employees
thereunder); and

         (e)      All actions, suits, proceedings, judgments, settlement
payments, fines, penalties, interest, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) reasonably incurred by the Company
or the Buyer incident to any of the foregoing;

         provided, that any such amounts shall

                  (i)      be computed considering the Tax benefit to the
indemnified person arising from the indemnified matter, and

                  (ii)     not include or be recoverable by any Person to the
extent covered by insurance available to the indemnified person.

         8.2.     LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY OF SELLERS.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 8.1 and any
other provision of this Agreement:

         (a)      Buyer shall not be entitled to indemnification for any
individual claim that does not exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) (the
"Threshold"). The Sellers shall not have any requirement to make
indemnification payments under this Agreement until the aggregate amount of
the indemnification obligation of the Sellers hereunder shall exceed
$750,000, in which case the Sellers shall only be liable for the portion of
such obligation in excess of $750,000, except as set forth in Section 8.2(d)
below.

         (b)      The Sellers shall not have any requirement to make
indemnification payments under this Agreement for breaches of
representations or warranties or for breaches of covenants or agreements to
be performed prior to Closing, except in respect of matters as to which the
Buyer shall have asserted a claim in the manner set forth in Section 8.5
hereof within fifteen (15) months of the Closing Date, provided that (i) any
claims relating to any inaccuracy in the Company's representations in
Sections 3.1 or 3.2 or the Sellers' representations set forth in Sections
3.32 (a) and (b) and any claims in respect of any inaccuracy in the
disclosures set forth on Schedule 3.2 shall survive the Closing
                         ------------
indefinitely, and (ii) claims in respect of the Excluded Liabilities, claims
in respect of the Defined Benefit Plan, claims in respect of breaches of
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.7, 3.13 and 3.18
hereof and claims determined by final, non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction to arise from fraud by the Sellers and/or the
Company, may be asserted at any time prior to the expiration of the
applicable statutes of limitations therefor (or any extensions thereof in
the case of Tax matters). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claim that has
been timely asserted by a Buyer Indemnified Person in accordance with this
Section 8.2(b) and Section 8.5 hereof shall survive past the applicable time
limits set forth in this Section 8.2(b) until the final resolution of the
claim.

                                    45

         (c)      The aggregate collective liability of the Sellers under this
Agreement shall not exceed $52,683,750 except as set forth in Section 8.2(d)

SatCom, except as set forth in Section 8.2(d) below.

Sellers' liability set forth in Sections 8.2(a) and 8.2(c) (including the
maximum limitations on the liability of Spacelink Ltd. and SatCom) shall not
be applicable to (i) obligations of the Sellers pursuant to Sections 2.7,
7.9(f), 7.11 and 9.7, (ii) claims in respect of the Excluded Liabilities,
(iii) any claims relating to any inaccuracy in the Company's representations
set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.7 or 3.13 or the Sellers' representations
set forth in Sections 3.32(a) and (b), (iv) any claims relating to any
inaccuracy in the disclosures set forth on Schedule 3.2, (v) any claims with
                                           ------------
respect to the Defined Benefit Plan, (vi) any claims with respect to the
Uncollected Receivables, and (vii) any claims determined by final,
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to arise from
fraud by the Sellers; provided, however, in no event shall the aggregate
indemnification liability of the Sellers exceed the amount of the Purchase
Price.

         8.3.     INDEMNIFICATION BY BUYER.

         Subject to the limitations of Section 8.4 below, from and after the
Closing the Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and their
respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns (the

Agreement, or any misrepresentation in any certificate or other instrument
furnished or to be furnished by the Buyer to the Sellers under this
Agreement;

Date (except for any events, occurrences or matters for which the Buyer or
the Company is entitled to be indemnified by the Sellers under this
Agreement);

         (c)      The failure by the Company or Buyer to timely pay the Employee
Bonuses; and

         (d)      All actions, suits, proceedings, judgments, settlement
payments, fines, penalties, interest, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incident to any of the foregoing;

         provided, that any such amounts shall

                  (i)      be computed considering the Tax benefit to the
indemnified person arising from the indemnified matter, and

                  (ii)     not include or be recoverable by any Person to the
extent covered by insurance available to the indemnified person.

         8.4.     LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY OF BUYER.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 8.3 and any

individual claim that does not exceed the Threshold. The Buyer shall not
have any requirement to make indemnification payments under this Agreement
until the aggregate amount of the indemnification obligation of the Buyer

hereof within fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date, provided that
claims determined by final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction to arise from fraud by Buyer may be asserted at any time prior
to the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations therefor.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claim that has been timely asserted by a
Seller Indemnified Person in accordance with this Section 8.4(b) and Section
8.5 hereof shall survive past the applicable time limits set forth in this
Section 8.4(b) until the final resolution of the claim.

         (c)      The aggregate liability of the Buyer under this Agreement
shall not exceed $4,200,000 except as set forth in Section 8.4(d) below.

         8.5.     NOTICE OF CLAIM.

         In the event that Buyer seeks indemnification on behalf of a Buyer
Indemnified Person, or Sellers seek indemnification on behalf of a Seller
Indemnified Person, such Party seeking indemnification (the "Indemnified
Party") shall give reasonably prompt written notice to the Party from which
it seeks indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") specifying the facts
constituting the basis for such claim and the amount, to the extent known,
of the claim asserted. The Parties shall attempt for not less than thirty
(30) days to negotiate a mutually satisfactory resolution of such matter. In
the event the Parties are not able to agree on a mutually satisfactory
resolution, either Party may seek to resolve the dispute by litigation in
any court of competent jurisdiction.

         8.6.     RIGHT TO CONTEST CLAIMS OF THIRD PERSONS.

         If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder
because of a claim asserted by any claimant other than an indemnified person
hereunder (a "Third Person"), the Indemnified Party shall give the
Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party, and using counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, to investigate, contest, control the defense of or settle
the claim alleged by such Third Person (a "Third-Person Claim"); the

Indemnified Party may thereafter participate in (but not control) the
defense of any such Third-Person Claim with its own counsel at its own
expense. If the Indemnifying Party shall fail to assume the defense of any
such Third-Person Claim,

claim, in such manner as it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited
to, settling such claim, after giving at least thirty (30) days' advance
notice of any proposed settlement to the Indemnifying Party and receiving
the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent, which may not be
unreasonably withheld, on such terms as the Indemnified Party, in good
faith, may deem appropriate, and

         (b)      the Indemnifying Party may participate in (but not control)
the defense of such action, with its own counsel at its own expense. The
Parties shall make available to each other all relevant information in their
possession relating to any such Third-Person Claim and shall cooperate in
the defense thereof.

         8.7.     EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.

         Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, the
provisions of this Article VIII shall constitute the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Parties from and after the Closing with respect to any claims
resulting from or arising out of the provisions of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, other than claims determined by final,
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to arise from
fraud.

                                 ARTICLE IX.

                          MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

notice of such violation from the Company or Sellers, as the case may be, to
Buyer, or (ii) by Buyer if the Company or Sellers shall violate any of their
respective obligations hereunder in any material respect and if such
violation shall not be corrected within ten (10) days following delivery of
a written notice of such violation from Buyer to the Company or Sellers, as
the case may be, or

         (d)      by any Party if there shall be any Law that makes consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby illegal or otherwise prohibited or
if consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby would violate any
nonappealable, final judgment, injunction, order or decree of any court or
Government body having competent jurisdiction.

         In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.1, (i) written notice thereof shall be given by the Party
terminating to each other Party hereto, (ii) this Agreement (other than
Article 9 and Section 7.5, which shall survive any such termination) shall

                                48


forthwith become null, void and of no further force or effect, and (iii)
there shall be no liability on the part of any Party hereto or their
respective officers and directors to any other Party hereto; provided that
no such termination shall relieve any Party from liability for any knowing
and intentional breach of such Party's representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements hereunder.

                                   -------

         The undersigned, being the principal owners of the Sellers, hereby
join in this Agreement solely to guarantee the due and punctual performance
by the Sellers of their obligations, covenants and agreements under this
Agreement, including the obligation of the Sellers to indemnify the Buyer
and the Buyer Indemnified Persons under Article VIII of this Agreement. The
foregoing guarantee is absolute and unconditional, is not subject to any
defense or offset, lack of consideration or similar defense and, in
connection herewith, the undersigned hereby waive any suretyship defenses
which they otherwise might have or assert in the event of enforcement
hereof, and the obligations of the undersigned shall survive the Closing in
the same manner and to the same extent as the obligations of the Sellers
hereby guaranteed. The undersigned hereby acknowledge that the Buyer has
made the execution of this Joinder a pre-condition of its execution of this
Agreement. The obligations of the undersigned under this Joinder shall be
joint and several provided that the liability of each of the undersigned for
the Sellers' obligation under this Agreement shall not exceed the product of
$52,683,750 multiplied by the percentage set opposite each of the
undersigneds' names, below. The foregoing limitation on the liability of the
undersigned in the preceding sentence, however, shall not be applicable to
those matters for which the Sellers' limitations on liability are not
applicable under Section 8.2(d) of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, the aggregate liability of the undersigned under
this Joinder shall not exceed the amount of the Purchase Price nor shall the
aggregate liability of each of the undersigned under this Joinder exceed the
product of the amount of the Purchase Price multiplied by the percentage set
opposite each of the undersigneds' names, below.
