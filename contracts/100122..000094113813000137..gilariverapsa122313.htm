adjusted, without duplication, to account for the Prorations and Interim
Operational Adjustments (as defined below and each, a "Closing Adjustment" and
collectively, referred to as the "Closing Adjustments"), the sum of which is
hereinafter referred to as the "Purchase Price".

2.6 Prorations . In addition to any adjustments necessary as a result of
Section 5.16, Buyers and Seller agree that the following items relating to the

of the Closing Date between Buyers and Seller with Seller liable to the extent

liable to the extent such items relate to periods commencing on and after the
Closing Date (measured in the same units used to compute the item in question,
otherwise measured by calendar days) (the "Prorations"):



PandS Page 22

* * *





(a) real estate Taxes, personal property Taxes, and any other ad valorem Taxes
or assessments representing liens on the Transferred Assets, in each case
without regard for whether such Taxes are assessed or due and payable as of
the Closing Date;

(b) rent, licensing fees or other fixed regular charges or registration fees
payable under leases or Licenses;

(c) any prepayments under Assigned Contracts, prepaid expenses and deposits

Transferred Assets by any Governmental Authority, other than fines and
penalties imposed for violations of Law.

In the event that actual real property Taxes or the actual figures for any of
the Prorations are not known or available on the Closing Date, for purposes of
determining the Estimated Purchase Price, the Prorations shall be based upon
the actual real property Taxes paid for the most recent year (or other
appropriate period) for which actual real property Taxes paid are available,
and based upon the respective amounts accrued through the Closing Date or paid
for the most recent year or other, appropriate period for which such amounts
paid are available. Such prorated Taxes or other amounts shall be recalculated
and (i) set forth in the Post-Closing Statement (in which case any amounts
owed by one Party to another shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.10) or
(ii) if unavailable at the time the Post-Closing Statement is prepared and
delivered in accordance with Section 2.10, any amounts owed by one Party to
the other Party shall be paid to the other Party within ten (10) Business Days
of such recalculation. The Prorations shall be based on the actual number of
days elapsed (prior to the Closing Date, on the one hand, and from and after
the Closing Date, on the other hand) in the year or other applicable period.
Seller and Buyers agree to furnish each other such documents and other records
as may be reasonably requested in order to confirm all adjustments and
Prorations calculated pursuant to this Section.

4,500 hours, Buyers are entitled to a credit against the Initial Purchase
Price in the amount of $500;



PandS Page 23

* * *





(c) for each kW by which the average Net Unit Output of Power Block 3 during
the Performance Test is more than two percent (2%) less than the applicable
Performance Guarantee Threshold, Buyers are entitled to a credit against the
Initial Purchase Price in the amount of $400 per kW;

(d) for each BTU/kWh by which the Heat Rate of Power Block 3 during the
Performance Test is more than three percent (3%) above the applicable
Performance Guarantee Threshold, Buyers are entitled to a credit against the
Initial Purchase Price in the amount of $15,000 per BTU/kWh;

(e) if any Scheduled Capital Project in Appendix F is not completed on or
before the Closing Date, Buyers are entitled to a credit against the Initial
Purchase Price in the amount set forth in Appendix F opposite such item
(provided that if any Scheduled Capital Project is only partially complete by
the Closing Date, the adjustment shall be prorated based on the percent such
item is completed); if Seller elects to move forward with an "As Needed"
project during the Interim Operational Period, the project will then be
considered a "Scheduled" project for purposes of Appendix F;

(f) if the value of the actual Scheduled Maintenance Projects performed prior
to the Closing Date are less than 90% of the value of the cumulative Scheduled
Maintenance Projects to be performed by the Closing Date and prorated to the
date of the month as shown in Appendix H, Buyers are entitled to a credit
against the Initial Purchase Price in the amount of any such deficiency for
Power Block 3 and 25% of any such amount for the Common Facilities; and

(g) if the value of the Inventory on the Closing Date is (i) less than 90% of
$10,012,536, Buyers are entitled to a credit against the Initial Purchase
Price in the amount of 25% of such deficiency and (ii) more than 110% (but not
to exceed 150%) of $10,012,536, Seller is entitled to an increase of the
Initial Purchase Price in the amount of 25% of such excess.

2.8 Deposit or Letter of Credit.

(a) Upon the later of (i) the execution of this Agreement and (ii) agreement
by the Parties and Sundevil upon the final form of the body of the Second
Amended and Restated Ownership Agreement as set forth in Section 5.1 below,
Buyers shall either (A) deliver to the Seller a letter of credit in form and
substance acceptable to Buyers, Seller and the issuing bank, which form shall
be attached as Exhibit L when agreed by the parties thereto pursuant to
Section 5.1(a), with an expiration date no earlier than December 31, 2014, and
in the amount of Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) (the "Letter of
Credit") or (B) deposit Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) by wire transfer
of immediately available funds (the "Deposit") into the escrow account
established pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, in each case to be drawn,
released, delivered or returned, as applicable (together with all accrued
investment income on the Deposit, if used) to either Seller or Buyers, as
applicable, as described in this Agreement, and in



PandS Page 24

* * *





accordance with the Escrow Agreement or the Letter of Credit, as applicable.
The Deposit, if used, shall be held as an escrow account and shall not be
subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process
of any creditor of any party, and shall be held and disbursed solely for the
purposes and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this
Agreement.

(b) If Closing shall occur, the Deposit (together with all accrued investment
income thereon) shall be applied toward payment of the Estimated Purchase
Price (defined below) at Closing. In the event Buyer posts a Letter of Credit,
if the Closing shall occur, the Letter of Credit shall be cancelled at Closing
subject to Seller's receipt of the Purchase Price (less the Seller Credit
Support) and delivery by Buyers to the Escrow Agent of the Seller Credit
Support. If Seller validly terminates this Agreement pursuant to Sections
10.1(e) or 10.1(g), Seller shall thereupon be entitled to receive the Deposit
or draw upon the face amount of the Letter of Credit as liquidated damages.
The Parties agree that (i) damages suffered by Seller in the event Seller
validly terminates this Agreement pursuant to Sections 10.1(e) or 10.1(g) are
incapable or very difficult to accurately estimate, (ii) the Deposit or the
face amount of the Letter of Credit is a reasonable forecast of just
compensation for such termination and (iii) receipt of the Deposit or face
amount of the Letter of Credit shall be the sole remedy of Seller in the event
of a termination of this Agreement by Seller pursuant to Sections 10.1(e) or
10.1(g).

(c) Upon the earlier to occur of Closing or termination of this Agreement,
Buyers and Seller shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow
Agent directing the Escrow Agent to release the Deposit (together with all
accrued investment income thereon) in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, or
shall provide the bank issuing the Letter of Credit draw down or cancellation
instructions in accordance with the specific requirements of the Letter of
Credit. The fees of the Escrow Agent shall be shared equally by Buyers on the
one hand and Seller on the other.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, except as provided in Section 2.8(b) above,
failure by the Parties to satisfy the Conditions to Closing set forth in
Article 8, and/or termination of this Agreement by Buyers as set forth in
Article 10, shall entitle Buyers to terminate this Agreement and instruct the
Escrow Agent to return the Deposit to Buyers or to instruct the bank issuing
the Letter of credit to cancel the Letter of Credit.

2.9 Estimated Closing Statement . At least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, Seller, with the assistance and participation of, and in
consultation with, Buyers, shall prepare and deliver to Buyers a written
estimated closing statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement") in the format
set forth in Exhibit A that shall set forth the Initial Purchase Price, as
adjusted to take into account Seller's best estimate of all Prorations and
sums due for Interim Operational Adjustments pursuant to Section 2.7,
including a reasonably detailed calculation of each such estimated adjustment
(the "Estimated Adjustments") and the revised, estimated



PandS Page 25

* * *





Purchase Price ("Estimated Purchase Price"). Within ten (10) calendar days
after the delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement by Seller to Buyers,
Buyers may object in good faith to the Estimated Adjustments in writing. If
Buyers object to the Estimated Adjustments within such ten (10) day period,
the Parties shall attempt to resolve their differences by negotiation. If the
Parties are unable to do so prior the Closing Date (or if Buyers do not object
to the Estimated Adjustments), the Initial Purchase Price shall be adjusted at
Closing by the amount of the Estimated Adjustment not in dispute. The disputed
portion shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11
and paid as part of any Post-Closing Statement.

2.10 Post-Closing Statement . Within sixty (60) days following the Closing
Date, Seller with the assistance and participation of, and in consultation
with, Buyers, shall prepare and deliver to Buyers a written post-closing
statement ("Post-Closing Statement") that shall set forth its proposed final
actual Prorations and sums due for Interim Operational Adjustments pursuant to
Section 2.7, including the amount, if any, by which the final Purchase Price
(as proposed by Seller) differs from the Estimated Purchase Price (the "Post-
Closing Adjustments"). If, as reflected in the finally determined Post-Closing
Statement, the final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase
Price, then Buyers shall promptly (within ten (10) days after the final
determination of the Post-Closing Statement) pay to Seller an amount in cash
equal to the difference between the final Purchase Price and the Estimated
Purchase Price. In the event that, as reflected in the finally determined
Post-Closing Statement, the final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated
Purchase Price, then Seller shall promptly (within ten (10) days after the
final determination of the Post-Closing Statement) pay to Buyers an amount in
cash equal to the difference between the final Purchase Price and the
Estimated Purchase Price. In the event Seller does not make such payment
within such ten (10) day-period, Buyer shall thereupon have the right to draw
upon the Seller Credit Support to fulfill Seller's payment obligation. Such
payment shall be made by the applicable Party(ies) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
receiving Party(ies).

(a) Dispute Notice. Buyers shall have thirty (30) days after their receipt of
the Post-Closing Statement to review and make inquiry concerning the Post-
Closing Statement and shall be deemed to have approved the Post-Closing
Statement (and such statement shall be final, binding and conclusive for all
purposes hereunder) unless the Buyers object thereto in writing (a "Dispute
Notice") prior to the end of such thirty (30) day period. The Seller shall
disclose upon Buyers' written request all factual information reasonably
requested by Buyer and the accounting methodology used in the preparation
thereof. If the Buyers timely deliver a Dispute Notice the Parties shall
attempt to resolve such dispute by negotiation. If the Parties are unable to
resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days after any objection dispute shall
be resolved pursuant to Section 2.11.



PandS Page 26

* * *





(b) The Post-Closing Statement shall become final, binding and conclusive for
all purposes hereunder by mutual agreement of the Parties, failure of the
receiving Party to timely deliver a Dispute Notice, or by decision of the
Independent Accountant.

2.11 Independent Accountant . In the event of a timely delivered Dispute
Notice pursuant to Section 2.10, the Parties shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any differences and issues described in the Dispute Notice as promptly
as practicable. If such differences and issues are resolved, then the Post-
Closing Statement, as adjusted for any changes agreed upon by the Parties,
shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. If the
Parties have not agreed upon the final Prorations and Closing Adjustments (if
any) to the Purchase Price within thirty (30) days following timely delivery
of the Dispute Notice pursuant to Section 2.10, then any Party may submit the
dispute to the Independent Accountant.

(a) If the Parties are unable to agree upon such a firm within ten (10)
Business Days of the date upon which the Independent Accountant declines to
serve, Buyers shall provide Seller a list of at least two (2) nationally
recognized independent certified public accounting firms, each independent as
to Buyers and their Affiliates, which Buyers nominate to serve as the
Independent Accountant hereunder. Within five (5) Business Days following
receipt of such list, Seller shall select one of such nominees, which shall
act as the Independent Accountant hereunder; provided, that Seller may not
select any such nominee unless such nominee is independent as to Seller and
its Affiliates. If either Party fails to act within the period specified, the
other Party may select an Independent Accountant; provided that the selecting
Party must choose an Independent Accountant that is a nationally recognized
independent certified public accounting firm, independent as to such Party and
its Affiliates; provided, further, that the non-selecting Party must advise
the selecting Party if such selected Independent Accountant is not independent
as to the non-selecting Party and its Affiliates.

(b)Buyers and Seller will enter into reasonable and customary arrangements for
the services to be rendered by the Independent Accountant under this Section
2.11. The Parties shall instruct the Independent Accountant to resolve solely
the items in dispute; provided, that the Independent Accountant may not
resolve any such dispute in such a way as to render the final Purchase Price
greater than that which is proposed by Seller or less than that which is
proposed by Buyers.

(c)All fees and costs of the Independent Accountant shall be divided equally
between Seller on one hand and the Buyers on the other hand. The Independent
Accountant may hold such proceedings and consult such experts as it deems
necessary or appropriate to resolve the dispute, and shall endeavor to do so
within thirty (30) days after being appointed. The Parties agree to cooperate
with the Independent Accountant and to provide promptly all information
reasonably requested by the Independent Accountant, subject to obtaining
standard assurances, consistent with Section 5.11, that such information will
be kept confidential and used solely for purposes of



PandS Page 27

* * *





the dispute resolution performed hereunder and for purposes of enforcing in a
court of competent jurisdiction any determination rendered by the Independent
Accountant.

(d)The Independent Accountant shall promptly notify all Parties in writing of
its findings and determinations, which shall be final, binding and conclusive
for all purposes hereunder. Judgment on any findings and determinations by the
Independent Accountant under this Section 2.11 may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction thereof.

2.12 Purchase Price Allocation .

(a) Each of Seller and Buyers shall, as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Date (but, in any event, prior to Closing), exercise good faith
efforts to agree upon an allocation of the Purchase Price among the
Transferred Assets in accordance with Applicable Tax Law. The Parties will
file all Tax Returns consistent with the allocation of the Purchase Price
determined in accordance with this Section 2.12. The allocation of the
Purchase Price (including any portion of the Assumed Liabilities if
applicable) will be negotiated by the Parties in accordance with Applicable
Tax Law. Seller shall propose and deliver to Buyers a preliminary allocation
among the Assets of the Purchase Price and such other consideration to be paid
to Seller pursuant to this Agreement (an "Allocation") sufficiently far in
advance of the Closing to allow the final pre-closing Allocation to be
determined prior to the Closing. The Allocation shall be consistent with
Applicable Tax Law and the regulations thereunder and in a manner which
facilitates property tax reporting. Buyers shall within thirty (30) days
thereafter propose any changes to the Allocation. Within thirty (30) days
following delivery of such proposed changes, Seller shall provide Buyers with
a statement of any objections to such proposed changes, together with a
reasonably detailed explanation of the reasons therefor. If Buyers and Seller
are unable to resolve any disputed objections within ten (10) days thereafter,
such objections shall be referred to the Independent Accountant as set forth
in Section 2.11.

(b) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyers shall prepare and
deliver to Seller for its review an allocation (consistent with the allocation
agreed upon prior to Closing in accordance with this Section 2.12) of an
amount equal to the sum of the Purchase Price and Assumed Liabilities properly
taken into account for purposes of determining the purchase price for U.S.
federal income tax purposes among the Transferred Assets in accordance with
Applicable Tax Law. Within sixty (60) days of its receipt of such allocation,
Seller shall (i) notify Buyers that it concurs with the allocation and/or
determination of fair market value, or (ii) provide written comments to the
allocation and/or determination of fair market value. If Buyers and Seller
disagree on any aspect of the allocation and/or determination of fair market
value, Buyers and Seller agree to use reasonable efforts to resolve any such
disagreement within one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date. Any
allocation of the Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities agreed or
determined pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall be binding on Buyers and Seller
for all Tax reporting purposes, and Buyers and Seller shall not (except with
the



PandS Page 28

* * *





consent of the other Party or as required by applicable Law) take inconsistent
positions with respect to, and shall each use reasonable efforts to sustain,
such allocation in any subsequent Tax audit or similar Proceeding, and each of
Buyers and Seller agrees to cooperate with the other in preparing IRS Form
8594, and to furnish the other with a draft copy of such form within a
reasonable period before its filing due date. If Buyers and Seller are unable
to resolve any disagreement with respect to the allocation within such one
hundred eighty (180) day period, the dispute shall be resolved by the
Independent Accountant in a manner substantially similar to Section 2.12.

2.13 Several Liability of Buyers . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, subject to the last paragraph of Section 2.1, the obligations
and liabilities of each Buyer arising under this Agreement are several and not
joint and not joint and several, and covenants applying to Buyers collectively
shall be construed as separate obligations of each Buyer individually, with
neither Buyer being responsible for the acts or failures to act of the other
Buyer; provided, however, that where this Agreement contemplates that a Buyer
or the Buyers may make an election or take any other discretionary act, then
each Buyer shall make the same election or take the same discretionary act.

any such analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument,
opinion and proposal. Each Party shall provide prompt notification to the
other Party when any License or Approval required to be obtained by the
notifying Party is obtained, taken, modified or given, as applicable. Each
Party will advise the other Party of any material communications with and,

(a) Costs associated with the Survey (defined below), preliminary title

(c) All costs associated with applying for and obtaining the Major Subdivision

5.3 Major Subdivision Approval; Surveys; Title Insurance.

(a) Within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date, Seller shall, at its sole
cost and expense, diligently and in good faith commence the process to obtain
approval from the Town, to



PandS Page 42

* * *





subdivide Blocks 3 and 4 of the Plat so as to create two separate, distinct
and contiguous parcels of real property comprising the Power Block 3 Site and
the Power Block 4 Site (the "Major Subdivision Approval"). Seller shall, at
its sole cost and expense, prepare or cause to be prepared, and delivered to
Buyers, an ALTA survey (the "Survey") and a subdivision plat containing the
legal description of the Common Property and Power Block Sites"), the
application required by the Town for the Major Subdivision Approval, and any
other documentation as may be required from the Town from time to time in
connection with obtaining the Major Subdivision Approval (collectively, the
"Application Documentation"). The Survey shall be sufficient to allow the
Title Insurer to issue the Title Policy acceptable to Buyers. The Survey shall
be certified in favor of the Seller, Buyers and the Title Insurer. Seller
shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the Survey to be completed
within one hundred and twenty-days (120) days of the Effective Date. Seller
shall coordinate with Buyers in Seller's preparation of the Application
Documentation, including, without limitation, affording Buyers a reasonable
opportunity to review the proposed legal description and be present during the
boundary staking. Seller shall provide Buyers reasonable prior written notice
of any meetings with the Town, and Buyers shall have a right to participate in
such meetings. Seller shall commence the Application Documentation, including
the Survey, within sixty (60) days of the Effective Date of this Agreement.
Seller shall provide the draft Application Documentation to Buyers for review
and approval. Within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such Application
Documentation, Buyers shall notify Seller of Buyers' approval or reasonable
disapproval of such Application Documentation. If Buyers approve such
Application Documentation and/or fail to deliver a written notice of
disapproval prior to expiration of such ten (10) Business Day period, then
Buyers shall be deemed to have approved the Application Documentation. If
Buyers deliver a notice of disapproval, which must set forth in reasonable
detail the bases for disapproval and Buyers' proposed alternatives prior to
expiration of such ten (10) Business Day period, then Seller and Buyers shall
meet together to attempt to resolve in good faith to their mutual satisfaction
all item(s) as to which objection was made within fifteen (15) Business Days
after receipt of the notice of disapproval. Seller shall submit the approved
(or deemed approved) Application Documentation to the Town. Seller shall
provide Buyers copies of all notices and/or correspondence received related to
the Application Documentation. Seller shall promptly notify Buyers in writing
upon receipt of the Major Subdivision Approval. Seller and Buyers' acknowledge
that receipt of the Major Subdivision Approval shall be a condition to Buyers'
obligation to close this transaction.

(b) Subject to Seller's completion of the requirements of Section 5.3(a),
Buyers shall procure a commitment (the "Title Commitment") from First American
Title Insurance Company (the "Title Insurer") to issue to Buyers an ALTA
owner's extended coverage policy of title insurance in form satisfactory to
Buyers in their sole discretion (the "Title Policy"), with the general survey
exception removed, an owner's comprehensive endorsement, and any other
endorsements requested by Buyers provided such endorsements are available in
Arizona, in an amount equal to that portion of the Purchase Price allocated to
the Transferred Real Property Assets and all



PandS Page 43

* * *





fixtures and improvements thereon (including Power Block 3) and be effective
as of the Closing Date, showing that title to the Transferred Real Property
Assets and all fixtures and improvements thereon are vested in Buyers subject
only to (i) the usual printed exceptions and exclusions contained in such
title insurance policies; and (ii) Permitted Encumbrances. Seller shall pay
the cost or premium for a standard coverage Title Policy and, if requested by
Buyers, Buyers shall pay all additional costs of obtaining an extended
coverage Title Policy and any and all endorsements to such Title Policy.
Seller shall cooperate with Buyers and Title Insurer to enable the Title
Insurer to issue the Title Policy at the Closing or as soon as reasonably
possible thereafter, including, without limitation, providing the Title
Insurer at or before the Closing with an owner's affidavit, if and to the
extent required by the Title Insurer as a requirement for issuing the Title
Policy to Buyer.

(c) Buyers shall review the Title Commitment and the Survey, and shall notify
Seller and Title Insurer in writing ("Buyers' Objection Notice") of any
objections to title or notice of any title exceptions which are unacceptable
to Buyers within forty-five (45) days of Buyers' receipt of both the Title
Commitment and the Survey (the "Title Review Period"). After the expiration of
the forty-five (45) day period, in the event any one or more amendments or
revisions are issued to the Title Commitment and such amendment or revision
(i) contains any matters that would adversely impact Buyers' intended or
potential use of the Transferred Assets, or (ii) which results in a monetary
obligation or contingent financial liability to Buyers and is not an Assumed
Liability, Buyers shall have not more than thirty (30) Business Days from the
delivery of such an amendment or revision and any supporting documents from
Seller to support the amendment or revision, to deliver an additional written
Buyers' Objection Notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
delivery of such an amended or revised Title Commitment and supporting
documents are provided to Buyers less than thirty (30) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Closing Date shall be extended so as to allow Buyers no
less than thirty (30) Business Days from receipt of such amendment or revision
and supporting documents to deliver an additional written Buyers' Objection
Notice prior to Closing and to allow Seller to deliver or to be deemed to
deliver the Seller's Response no less than ten (10) Business Days prior to
Closing.

(d) If Buyers timely deliver Buyers' Objection Notice, Seller shall cooperate
with Buyer to eliminate title exceptions objected to by Buyers, but, subject
to subsection (e) below, Seller shall have no obligation to cure or correct
any matter objected to by Buyers. On or before the fifth (5th) Business Day
following Seller's receipt of Buyers' Objection Notice, Seller may elect, by
delivering written notice of such election to Buyers ("Seller's Response"), to
cause Title Insurer to remove or insure over any matters objected to in
Buyers' Objection Notice. If Seller fails to deliver Seller's Response within
the period set forth above, it shall be deemed an election by Seller not to
cause Title Insurer to so remove or insure over such objections. If Seller
elects or is deemed to have elected not to cause Title Insurer to so remove or
insure over an objected matter, then Buyers must elect, by delivering written
notice of such election to Seller on or before the



PandS Page 44

* * *





earlier to occur of (a) the tenth (10th) Business Day following Buyers'
receipt of Seller's Response or (b) if no Seller's Response is received by
Buyers, the tenth (10th) Business Day following the date on which Seller shall
have been deemed to have responded, as provided above, to: (i) terminate this
Agreement, in which case the Deposit shall be immediately returned to Buyers
or the Letter of Credit cancelled; (ii) negotiate a mutually agreeable amount
to be included as a Closing Adjustment; or (iii) proceed with this
transaction, in which event those objected to exceptions or matters that
Seller has not elected to cause Title Insurer to so remove or insure shall be
deemed to be Permitted Exceptions.

(e) If Buyers do not timely deliver the termination notice provided for in
Section 5.3(d), Buyers may not terminate this Agreement due to dissatisfaction
with the Title Commitment or Survey unless Seller fails to sufficiently
cooperate with Title Insurer to satisfy Seller's obligation to procure the
Title Policy as set forth in Section 5.3(f) below. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall cause any Existing Encumbrances
to be released at or prior to Closing in accordance with Section 5.14, and
shall remove any exceptions or Encumbrances to title which are created by or
at the sufferance of Seller after the date of this Agreement without Buyers'
consent. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyers shall not be required to
object to any Existing Encumbrances or to any exceptions or Encumbrances to
title which are created by or at the sufferance of Seller after the Effective
Date without Buyers' consent, and none of such matters shall constitute
Permitted Encumbrances.

(f) Before or at Closing, Seller shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts
(including providing mechanic's lien affidavits and other affidavits
customarily required by the Title Insurer in issuing a Title Policy and
satisfaction of those requirements that must be met by releasing or satisfying
monetary liens) to satisfy any requirements of the Title Insurer that are set
forth in the Title Commitments and that are applicable to Seller for purposes
of issuing the Title Policies. Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to deliver the Major Subdivision Approval to Buyers within four (4)
months after the Effective Date. By no later than seven (7) months after the
Effective Date, Seller shall deliver the Major Subdivision Approval and Survey
to Buyers, and if Seller fails to do so, Buyers may (i) terminate this
Agreement and receive a refund of the Deposit or cancel the Letter of Credit,
or (ii) extend the time period for compliance with this Section 5.3(f) in
their reasonable discretion.

5.4 Third Party Intellectual Property. Before or at Closing, Seller shall
promptly request, or cause its Affiliates to request, its and its Affiliates'
third party licensors, vendors or service providers that are not Affiliates of
Seller or any other Affiliate ("Third Party Vendors") that provide information
technology and related services or Intellectual Property (collectively, the
"Third Party IP") currently used in connection with the operation of Power
Block 3 (excluding any Transferred Intellectual Property) to issue to Buyers a
non-exclusive license to use such Third Party IP, and Seller shall pay the
costs of any transfer, reissuance or similar fees required by such Third Party
Vendors. Buyers shall, at their option, (i) execute any standard license,



PandS Page 45

* * *





assumption or similar agreement required by such Third Party Vendor and shall
pay any periodic or other on-going license fees, royalties or other similar
payments required for the continued use of such Third Party IP, or (ii) advise
Seller of any determination not to execute such standard license, assumption
or equivalent agreement, whereupon Seller shall have no obligation to transfer
to Buyers the affected Third Party IP. In the event Buyers fail to comply with
the standard terms required by a Third Party Vendor, Seller shall not be
liable under this Agreement for any consequences resulting from Buyers' lack
of rights to use such Third Party IP.

5.5 HSR Act Filings. Seller and Buyers shall, on or before June 1, 2014, each
file or cause its ultimate parent entity (within the meaning of the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act")) to
file any and all materials required to be filed by it under the HSR Act with
respect to the Transactions and will promptly file any supplemental materials
required or requested, and shall comply in all material respects with any
applicable requirements of the HSR Act. Each Party shall cooperate with the
other in submitting such filings, including providing, as promptly as
practicable upon written request, any specific information concerning itself
or its Affiliates required in connection with such HSR filing. The filing fee
associated with such filings shall be borne equally by the Seller and Buyers.
Other than the filing fee, fees and expenses incurred by any Party in
connection with the filing that such Party or its Affiliates makes under the
HSR Act in connection with the Transactions shall be allocated pursuant to
Section 5.2.

5.6 FERC Transaction Authorization. Buyers shall as soon as practicably
possible, but no later than May 15, 2014, file with the FERC a joint
application with Seller seeking the FERC's authorization for Buyers to acquire
Power Block 3 and any jurisdictional facilities (as defined in the Federal
Power Act) pursuant to this Agreement. Each Buyer and, if applicable, Seller
shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to seek to obtain applicable FERC
orders containing such approval in sufficient time to permit Closing to occur
as promptly as possible. Each of Buyers and Seller, as applicable, shall
promptly make any appropriate or necessary subsequent or supplemental filings
required of it by FERC. Each Party shall pay its own filing fees and expenses
in connection with any filing that such Party or its Affiliates makes with
FERC in connection with the Transactions. FERC authorization that includes
conditions and/or mitigation that resulted or would result in a material
change that has or would have a significant adverse effect on either TEP's or
UNSE's assets or liabilities, wholesale or retail market operations (including
the sale or purchase of energy, capacity, ancillary services, transmission
services and/or balancing services), cost of service (whether wholesale or
retail), reliability of service to wholesale or retail customers, financial
condition or results of operation, earnings per share or business in general,
may be considered as "non-approval" of the Transactions by FERC. In the event
FERC does not approve this transaction or authorizes the transaction with
conditions and/or mitigation that may be considered as "non-approval" pursuant
to the immediately preceding sentence, Buyer may terminate this Agreement and
receive a refund of the Deposit (or cancel the Letter of Credit), provided
that Buyers shall notify Seller within ten (10) Business



PandS Page 46

Days of receipt of any applicable FERC authorization containing such
conditions whether Buyers consider such FERC authorization and conditions to
be "non-approval" of the Transactions by FERC.

ongoing claims or Proceedings in respect of such Tax Returns).

(c) Each Party shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cooperate fully

applicable statute of limitations and to abide by all record retention

necessary to be disclosed to taxing authorities and accountants preparing
Seller's tax reports and filings, or as may be required under applicable Law
(subject to Section 5.11(a)(ii)(y)(c) below), (1) any and all information
received by or in the possession of Seller relating to Buyers' business,
assets, operations or prospects, which is either non-public, confidential or
proprietary, or (2) any and all analyses, compilations, data, studies or other
documents prepared by or for Buyers relating to the Gila River Power Station

Regulatory Approvals, or as may be necessary to be disclosed to taxing
authorities and accountants preparing Buyers' tax reports and filings, or as
may be required under applicable Law (subject to Section 5.11(a)(ii) below)

relating to Seller's business, assets, operations or prospects and/or relating
to the Gila River Power Station which is either non-public, confidential or

(ii) Notwithstanding Section 5.11(a)(i), (x) Seller and Buyers shall be
entitled to the extent necessary for the performance of their respective
duties hereunder to disclose Confidential Information of the other Party
exclusively to such of its directors, employees, consultants and advisors who
are directly concerned with or affected by the carrying out of the Parties'
duties under this Agreement, have a need to know such Confidential Information
in order to carry out such duties, and who have agreed to be bound by the
terms of this Agreement or are otherwise bound by confidentiality obligations
no less restrictive than those contained herein (each, a "Representative" and



PandS Page 49

* * *





collectively, "Representatives"); provided, however, that each Party shall
inform each of such Persons of the confidential nature of such information and
of that Party's obligations of confidentiality in respect thereof and such
Party shall be responsible for any breach of such obligations by any
recipients of such Confidential Information; and (y) the Parties shall have no
obligation with respect to any Confidential Information, as applicable, which
(a) at the time of receipt from such other Party was already in the public
domain; (b) after receipt from such other Party becomes part of the public
domain through no fault of such Party or others acting on behalf of such
Party; (c) was rightfully in such Party's or its Representatives' possession
prior to receipt from such other Party; (d) has been rightfully disclosed to

Party shall give the disclosing Party the opportunity to object to the
disclosure and/or to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy in
order to limit such disclosure, and (2) in the event no such protective order
or other appropriate remedy is obtained prior to the time disclosure is
required, or in the event that the disclosing Party waives compliance with the
terms of this Section 5.11, the disclosing Party may disclose only that part
of the Confidential Information as it is advised by counsel that is required
to be disclosed, and shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to ensure
that all Confidential Information and other information that is so disclosed
will be accorded confidential treatment as close as practicable to that
provided hereunder). Nothing in this Agreement shall bar the right of either
Party to seek and obtain from any court injunctive relief against conduct or
threatened conduct which violates this Section 5.11. For the purposes of this
Section 5.11, the Parties agree that Fortis, Inc., and FortisUS, Inc. and
their respective directors, officers, employees, consultants and advisors

promptly destroy all copies, summaries, extracts, memoranda, notes and other
writings of, containing, or based upon any Confidential Information,
regardless of who prepared such writings; and (c) promptly expunge all
Confidential Information from all computers and other electronic or other
storage devices, except that neither Party shall be required to destroy
Confidential Information stored on backup tapes and each Party may retain one
(1) copy of Confidential Information in its files for audit and compliance
purposes. The disclosing Party may request a destruction certificate and,
within fifteen (15) days following receipt of such request, an officer of the
receiving Party shall certify to the disclosing Party, in writing, that the
receiving Party has complied with this Section 5.11(c).

(d) Each Party shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to seek mutual
agreement on all external press releases, communications or disclosures

to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information as required
hereunder shall continue for a period of two (2) years following the
expiration of this Agreement.

5.12 Complete Disclosure . If any Party becomes aware of any fact or
circumstance that does or would reasonably be expected to render untrue any
representation or warranty of such Party in this Agreement or any other
statement made or document provided to the other Party, or of any failure of
such Party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement, such Party shall promptly give notice of such fact or circumstance
to the other Party.

5.13 Failure to Obtain Consent . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or any Closing Agreement, to the extent that the
transfer to Buyers of any Assigned Contract, Transferred Intellectual Property
or Transferred License requires the authorization, approval, consent or waiver
of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person, and Buyers, acting in
their reasonable discretion, agree to waive the requirement that such Assigned
Contract, Transferred Intellectual Property or Transferred License be conveyed
as a condition to Closing and the Closing occurs without such authorization,
approval, consent or waiver having been obtained, then neither this Agreement
nor the transactions contemplated by any Closing Agreement shall constitute a
transfer of such Assigned Contract, Transferred Intellectual Property or
Transferred License, or an attempt thereof. In the event that Closing occurs
without the transfer of such Assigned Contract, Transferred Intellectual
Property or Transferred License,



PandS Page 51

* * *





then, following Closing, each Party shall use its Commercially Reasonable
Efforts, and shall cooperate with the other Party, to obtain promptly such
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers; provided, that neither Seller
nor Buyers shall be required to pay any consideration for any such
authorization, approval, consent or waiver (other than any applicable filing
fees) or to agree to any conditions or requirements which would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on it.

(a) Pending such authorization, approval, consent or waiver, the Parties shall
cooperate with each other in any mutually agreeable, reasonable and lawful
arrangements (to the extent any such arrangements are feasible) designed to
provide to Buyers the benefits of such Assigned Contract, Transferred
Intellectual Property or Transferred License that Buyers would have obtained
had such Assigned Contract, Transferred Intellectual Property or Transferred
License been transferred to Buyers at Closing. To the extent Buyers are
provided the benefits pursuant to this Section 5.13 of any such Assigned
Contract, Transferred Intellectual Property or Transferred License, Buyers
shall perform, for the benefit of Seller, the obligations of Seller thereunder
and any related liability that, but for the lack of an authorization,
approval, consent or waiver in connection with the assignment of such Assigned
Contract, Transferred Intellectual Property or Transferred License to Buyers,
would have constituted an Assumed Liability, and Seller shall assign to Buyers
the right to all receive all payments, proceeds and other monies due or
payable thereunder and direct any payor to pay such payments, proceeds and
other monies directly to Buyers. Once authorization, approval, consent or
waiver for the transfer of any such Assigned Contract, Transferred
Intellectual Property or Transferred License not transferred at Closing is
obtained, Seller shall transfer any such Assigned Contract, Transferred
Intellectual Property or Transferred License to Buyers and, subject to the
terms of Section 2.3 and 2.4, the obligations of Seller associated therewith
shall thereupon be deemed Assumed Liabilities.

(b) To the extent any such Assigned Contract, Transferred Intellectual
Property or Transferred License cannot be transferred following Closing
pursuant to this Section 5.13, Buyers and Seller shall cooperate reasonably in
an effort to find and enter into mutually agreeable arrangements (including
subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting), if feasible, to provide the
Parties the economic (taking into account Tax costs and benefits) and
operational equivalent, to the extent permitted, of obtaining such
authorization, approval, consent or waiver and the performance by Buyers of
the obligations thereunder. If Seller receives any payments, proceeds or other
monies in respect of such Assigned Contract, Transferred Intellectual Property
or Transferred License in connection with the arrangements under this Section
5.13, Seller shall hold the same in a segregated account in trust for Buyers,
and pay the same over to Buyers promptly upon receipt thereof without
deduction. This Section 5.13 shall in all cases be limited to the extent
necessary not to result in a violation of applicable Law.

5.14 Existing Encumbrances. Seller shall cause all of the Existing
Encumbrances to be fully discharged and released with respect to the
Transferred Assets prior to or simultaneously with



PandS Page 52

* * *





Closing and, at Closing, the Existing Encumbrances shall cease to be deemed
Permitted Encumbrances and Seller shall transfer to Buyers the Transferred
Assets, free and clear of all such Existing Encumbrances. Without limiting the
foregoing, (i) with respect to any easements, licenses and other real property
rights conveyed to Buyers pursuant to this Agreement or the Closing
Agreements, including all easements and other rights pursuant to the
Reciprocal Easement Agreement, the Pipeline Easements, the Second Amended and
Restated Ownership Agreement, or the Special Warranty Deed, that do or may
encumber, cover or affect any portion of the remainder of the Gila River Power
Station as to which any Existing Encumbrances may remain in place, Seller
shall cause the holders of all such Existing Encumbrances to execute and
deliver at or prior to Closing such written instruments subordinating the
liens of such Existing Encumbrances to all of such easements, licenses and
other rights, in recordable form and otherwise in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Buyers, and (ii) Seller shall cause each Credit
Facility Agent to deliver at or prior to Closing the Credit Facility Release
Documentation.

5.15 Bulk Sales Laws. The Parties hereby waive compliance with the provisions
of any bulk sales, bulk transfer or similar Laws of any jurisdiction that may
otherwise be applicable with respect to the sale of any or all of the
Transferred Assets to Buyers, it being understood that any liabilities arising
out of the failure of Seller to comply with the requirements and provisions of
any bulk sales, bulk transfer or similar Laws of any jurisdiction shall be
treated as Excluded Liabilities.

5.16 Risk of Loss. During the Interim Operational Period, all risk of loss or
damage to the property included in the Transferred Assets shall, as between
Buyers and Seller, be borne by Seller. If the Transferred Assets are damaged
or destroyed by fire, theft, vandalism, or other insurable casualty event
(each such event, an "Event of Loss"), or are taken by a Governmental
Authority by exercise of the power of condemnation or eminent domain (each, a
"Taking"), then the following provisions of this Section 5.16 shall apply:

(a) If, before the Closing Date, all or any portion of Power Block 3 or the
Common Facilities becomes subject to or is threatened with a Taking, Seller
shall notify Buyers promptly in writing of such fact. If such Taking would
create a Material Adverse Effect, then Buyers may, at their option, (i)
receive from Seller an assignment of any claim, settlement or proceeds thereof
with respect to the applicable Transferred Assets and proceed with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Article 10.

(b) If any time before the Closing Date all or any portion of Power Block 3 or
the Common Facilities are damaged or destroyed by one or more Events of Loss,
and the fair market value of such damaged or destroyed Transferred Assets
(disregarding the effect of such damage or destruction) or the projected cost
of repair of the Transferred Assets that were damaged, lost or destroyed is
less than ten percent (10%) of the Initial Purchase Price, Seller may, at its
option, either (i) cause the actual damage or destruction to be repaired or
replaced in accordance with



PandS Page 53

* * *





Prudent Operating Practices to a good operating condition and that otherwise
satisfies the representations and warranties contained in the Agreement;
provided that at any Closing following such repair or replacement, for
purposes of Section 8.2(a) only, Section 3.11 shall be included in the last
parenthetical contained therein, (ii) reduce the Purchase Price by the lesser
of (x) the fair market value of the Transferred Assets damaged or destroyed
(such value to be determined as of the date immediately prior to such damage
or destruction), or (y) Seller's share of the estimated cost to repair or
restore the same (any disagreement with respect thereto being resolved in
accordance with Section 2.11), (iii) upon the Closing, transfer the proceeds
or the rights to the proceeds of applicable insurance with respect to such
damages or destroyed Transferred Assets to Buyers, or (iv) bear Seller's share
of the costs of repairing, or restoring such damaged or destroyed portions of
Power Block 3 or the Common Facilities to the extent the proceeds of
applicable insurance transferred to Buyers are insufficient to do so. In order
to accomplish the foregoing, Seller may delay the Closing and any right to
terminate this Agreement for a reasonable time (but not to exceed six (6)
months) necessary to accomplish the same.

(c) If (i) any time before the Closing Date all or any portion of Power Block
3 or the Common Facilities are damaged or destroyed by an Event of Loss, and
the fair market value of such damaged or destroyed Transferred Assets
(disregarding the effect of such damage or destruction) or the projected cost
of repair of the Transferred Assets that were damaged, lost or destroyed is
greater than ten percent (10%) of the Initial Purchase Price or (ii) Power
Block 3 fails to achieve the Minimum Performance Threshold for Net Unit Output
and/or Heat Rate, then Seller may elect to cause the actual damage,
destruction or deficiency to be repaired or replaced in accordance with
Prudent Operating Practices to a good operating condition and that otherwise
satisfies the representations and warranties contained in the Agreement and
the Minimal Performance Thresholds; provided that at any Closing following
such repair or replacement, for purposes of Section 8.2(a) only, Section 3.11
shall be included in the last parenthetical contained therein; provided
further that the time for completion of the projected repair of the
Transferred Assets, using reasonable due diligence and Commercially Reasonable
Efforts, is no later than June 1, 2015. If Seller does not elect to cause the
actual damage, destruction or deficiency to be repaired or replaced in
accordance with the preceding sentence, Buyers may elect to (x) if an Event of
Loss has occurred, require Seller upon the Closing to transfer the rights to
Seller's share of proceeds (or the right to the proceeds) with respect to the
Transferred Assets of applicable insurance to Buyers and proceed with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless such proceeds have been
expended repairing the Transferred Assets that were damaged, lost or destroyed
by the relevant Events of Loss, (y) terminate this Agreement or (z) or
mutually agree with Seller as to an alternate resolution.

5.17 Closing Agreements . At Closing, each of the Parties shall enter into the
Closing Agreements to which it is to be a party.

necessary to complete or correct any information in such Schedules; for the
avoidance of doubt, Schedules that are inaccurate or incomplete due to events
or matters occurring prior to the Effective Date as to which Seller first

Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(f). If Buyers do not so timely elect

matters identified in all Schedule Updates, whether prior to or after the
Schedule Update in question), the Schedule Update shall be deemed to have
amended the appropriate Schedule or Schedules as of the date of this
Agreement, to have qualified the representations and warranties contained in
Article 3 as of the date of this Agreement, and to have cured any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty that otherwise might have existed
hereunder by reason of the existence of such matter, subject to the succeeding
sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyers shall be entitled to
indemnification subject to and in accordance with Section 11.2(a) and the
limitations and thresholds contained in Article 11 in an aggregate amount not
to exceed five million Dollars ($5,000,000) to the extent of the inaccuracy of
any representation or warranty made by Seller (disregarding all Schedule
Updates) that is affected by any Schedule Update results in any Losses to
Buyers; provided that Buyers shall not be entitled to any indemnification
pursuant to this sentence with respect to any Contracts or other matters
approved by or consented to by Buyers pursuant to this Article 6.

11.4 Further Qualifications Respecting Indemnification. The right of any

indemnification, including receipt of notice of any Proceeding from any third
party (such third party actions being collectively referred to herein as
"Third Party Claims"), the Indemnitee shall give written notice thereof (each,

PandS Page 72

* * *





practicable but, in any event, within thirty (30) days after the date the
Indemnitee obtains actual knowledge of the basis or alleged basis for the
right of indemnity. The failure of the Indemnitee to provide a Claim Notice
within any time period shall not relieve the Indemnitor of liability hereunder
except and only to the extent the defense of such Third Party Claim is
materially prejudiced by the failure to give such Claim Notice;

(b)In computing Losses for which an Indemnitee seeks indemnification pursuant
to Section 11.2(a) or Section 11.3(a) (but not for purposes of determining
inaccuracy or breach), references to "Material Adverse Effect" or other
materiality qualifications (or correlative terms) shall be disregarded and the
representations and warranties that are the subject thereof shall be
interpreted as if those disregarded words were not included;

(c)In computing Losses, such amounts shall be computed net of any related
recoveries that the Indemnitee actually receives under insurance policies, or
other related payments actually received from third parties, and net of any
Tax benefits actually received by the Indemnitee;

(d)The Indemnitee shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to mitigate all
Losses for which indemnification may be available hereunder, including
availing itself of any defenses, limitations, rights of contribution, claims
against third Persons and other rights at law or equity;

(e)Seller shall have no liability for any Losses that represent the cost of
repairs, replacements or improvements which enhance the value of the repaired,
replaced or improved asset above the value it was obligated to have under this
Agreement at Closing; and

(f)Seller and Buyers agree that any remedial action, correction of
noncompliance or other action required by this Agreement to be undertaken or
for which indemnification is provided in this Article 11, (i) shall be the
most commercially reasonable method under the circumstances and based upon the
understanding that the Transferred Assets are and shall continue to be used
for industrial purposes, (ii) shall permit the continued safe operation of
Power Block 3 in the manner in which it is currently operated and shall not
subject Buyers to increased liability in any material respect, (iii) except as
otherwise provided in the immediately preceding clause (ii), shall not exceed
the least stringent requirements of Environmental Law or any clean-up
standards set forth, established, published, proposed or promulgated under,
pursuant to or by an Environmental Law or Governmental Authority having
jurisdiction over such remedial action, correction of noncompliance or action,
in each case as in effect on the date of such remedial action, correction of
noncompliance or other action or any requirement or order of any Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction over such remedial action, correction of
noncompliance or action and (iv) shall be conducted in compliance with
Environmental Law.

with each Claim Notice a copy of such Third Party Claim or other documents
received (if applicable) and shall otherwise make available to the Indemnitor
all relevant information material to the defense



PandS Page 73

* * *





of such claim and within the Indemnitee's possession. The Indemnitor shall, as
promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within fifteen (15) days after its
receipt of the Claim Notice), notify the Indemnitee in writing of whether
Indemnitor desires to assume and control the defense of the Third Party Claim
that is the subject of such Claim Notice. If the Indemnitor timely notifies
the Indemnitee of its desire to defend the Third Party Claim pursuant to this
Section 11.5 and acknowledges its obligations to indemnify hereunder, the
Indemnitor shall have control over the defense of such Third Party Claim and
related Proceedings, including any settlement thereof. The Indemnitor shall
employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee (consent to which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed by Indemnitee), and
shall pay all expenses in connection with the conduct of such defense. The
Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such
Proceeding and to participate in (but not control) the defense of such Third
Party Claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the
Indemnitee unless the Indemnitor shall agree otherwise. The Indemnitor shall
diligently work to defend any Third Party Claim that it has agreed to defend
and shall consult and cooperate with the Indemnitee regarding such defense and
shall not enter into any settlement without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. The Indemnitor shall not be entitled to control (but shall be
entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense of), and the
Indemnitee shall be entitled to have sole control over, at the Indemnitor's
expense, the defense or settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment
of any Third Party Claim (i) if the Indemnitor shall have failed to timely
notify Indemnitee of its desire to defend the Third Party Claim and
acknowledged its indemnification obligations hereunder, (ii) if the Indemnitor
fails to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, (iii) if
the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses
available to the Indemnitee that are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnitor, (iv) if the Indemnitee's counsel shall have
advised the Indemnitee that there is a conflict of interest that could make it
inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct to have
common counsel, (v) to the extent the Third Party Claim seeks an order,
injunction, or other equitable relief against the Indemnitee which, if
successful, would materially adversely affect the business, operations,
assets, or financial condition of the Indemnitee or (vi) in the event the
Indemnitee is a Buyer Indemnified Party, if the Third Party Claim seeks
damages in excess of the Seller Credit Support (so long as the Seller Credit
Support has not expired or terminated in accordance with its terms at such
time) or the Indemnity Cap; provided, that the Indemnitee shall make no
settlement, compromise, admission or acknowledgment that would give rise to
liability on the part of the Indemnitor without the prior written consent of
the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

11.6 Purchase Price Adjustment . The Parties agree to treat all payments made
pursuant to this Article 11 as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law or taxing authority
interpretations thereof.

electronic counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of
which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

12.4 Captions and Paragraph Headings . Captions and paragraph headings used

not be used in construing it.

12.6 Construction. This Agreement and any documents or instruments delivered
pursuant hereto shall be construed without regard to the identity of the
Person who drafted the various provisions of the same. Each and every
provision of this Agreement and such other documents and instruments shall be
construed as though the Parties participated equally in the drafting of the
same. Consequently, the Parties acknowledge and agree that any rule of
construction that a document is to be construed against the drafting Party
shall not be applicable either to this Agreement or such other documents and
instruments. Any reference to any statute shall be deemed to refer to the
statute, as amended, and to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
as amended, unless the context requires otherwise. The representations,
warranties and covenants in this Agreement shall have independent
significance. Accordingly, if a Party has breached any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement in any respect, the fact that
there exists another representation, warranty or covenant relating to the same
subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) that the
Party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact the Party
is in breach of the first representation, warranty or covenant.

12.7 Waiver. The failure of a Party to insist, in any one or more instances,
on performance of any of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Agreement
shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of any rights granted
hereunder or of the future performance of any such term, covenant or
condition, but the obligations of the Parties with respect thereto shall
continue in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision or condition of
this Agreement by a Party shall be valid unless in writing signed by such
Party. A waiver by one Party of the performance of any covenant, condition,
representation or warranty of the other Party shall not invalidate this
Agreement, nor shall such waiver be construed as a waiver of any other
covenant, condition, representation or warranty. A waiver by any Party of the
time for performing any act shall not constitute a waiver of the time for
performing any other act or the time for performing an identical act required
to be performed at a later time.

12.8 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each Party hereby expressly waives any rights which
it may have to a jury trial with respect to any suit, legal action or
Proceeding brought by or against it or any of its Affiliates relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions.

12.9 Governing Law.

(a)This Agreement shall be governed in all respects, including validity,
interpretation and effect, by the internal Laws of the State of New York
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New
York.

(b)Each Party hereby unconditionally and irrevocably, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, (i) consents to jurisdiction in any Proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, or any of the Closing Agreements or the
Transactions contemplated hereby, and agrees that any

* * *





Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any Closing Agreement or any
judgment obtained as a result thereof may be brought and prosecuted in a state
court of competent jurisdiction located in New York City, New York or in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, (ii)
submits to the in personam jurisdiction of such courts and waives and agrees
not to assert in any Proceeding before any such courts, by way of motion, as a
defense or otherwise, any claim that it is not subject to the in personam
jurisdiction of any such courts, and (iii) waives any objection that it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue in any Proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, any Closing Agreement or the Transactions
contemplated hereby brought in any such courts and any claim that any such
Proceeding brought in any such courts has been brought in an inconvenient
forum.

12.10 No Partnership. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be
construed to create any partnership, joint venture or similar relationship
between Buyers and Seller; and in no event shall either Party take a position
in any Tax Return or other writing of any kind that a partnership, joint
venture or other similar relationship exists. The Parties do not intend to
form or hold themselves out as a de jure or de facto partnership, joint
venture or similar relationship, to share profits or losses, or to share any
joint control over financial decisions or discretionary actions.

12.11 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be valid, binding and enforceable under
applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
unenforceable under applicable Law, such provision shall be unenforceable only
to the extent expressly so held, without affecting the remainder of such
provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement. The Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to agree upon legal, valid and enforceable substitute
provisions to carry out the purposes and intent of any such unenforceable
provision.

12.12 Time of the Essence. Time is hereby expressly made of the essence with
respect to each and every term and provision of this Agreement. The Parties
acknowledge that each will be relying upon the timely performance by the other
of its obligations hereunder as a material inducement to each Party's
execution of this Agreement.

12.12 Specific Performance. Seller acknowledges that the remedies at law of
Buyers for a breach or threatened breach by Seller of this Agreement would be
inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, Buyers, without posting any bond,
and in addition to all other remedies that may be available, shall be entitled
to obtain equitable relief in the form of specific performance, a temporary
restraining order, a temporary or permanent injunction or any other equitable
remedy that may then be available, upon a breach or threatened breach of this
Agreement by Seller.

12.13 No Director or Affiliate Liability. Neither any direct nor indirect
holder of equity interests in Buyers or Seller, nor any past, present or
future director, officer, employee, agent or Affiliate of Buyers or Seller or
of any such holder, shall have any liability or obligation of any

nature whatsoever in connection with or under this Agreement or in connection
with the Transactions, and Buyers and Seller, as applicable, hereby waive and
release all claims of any such liability or obligation.

12.14 Limitations on Damages. EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF A PARTY'S FRAUD OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT, NO PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY OF ITS
CONTRACTORS, SUBCONTRACTORS, AGENTS OR AFFILIATES, FOR ANY DAMAGES, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), WARRANTY, STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER
LEGAL THEORY, ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE ACTIONS OR
TRANSACTIONS PROVIDED FOR HEREIN, OTHER THAN DAMAGES THAT ARE THE NATURAL AND
PROBABLE CONSEQUENCE OF ANY BREACH AND FLOW DIRECTLY FROM SUCH BREACH.
PURPORTED DAMAGES NOT FLOWING DIRECTLY FROM THE BREACH, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE
SPECULATIVE, INDIRECT, UNFORESEEN OR IMPROBABLE, ARE NOT RECOVERABLE (IT BEING
UNDERSTOOD THAT LOST PROFITS THAT ARE THE NATURAL AND PROBABLE CONSEQUENCE OF
ANY BREACH AND THAT FLOW DIRECTLY FROM SUCH BREACH ARE NOT WAIVED HEREBY).
EACH PARTY HEREBY RELEASES THE OTHER PARTIES AND THEIR CONTRACTORS,
SUBCONTRACTORS, AGENTS AND AFFILIATES FROM ANY SUCH DAMAGES (EXCEPT TO THE
EXTENT PAID TO A THIRD PARTY IN A THIRD PARTY CLAIM).

12.15 Online Data Room. The phrases "provided to Buyers" and "delivered to
Buyers" and phrases of similar import mean that Seller has, prior to the
Effective Date, made the material or information subject of such phrase
available to Buyers in the online Intralinks data room maintained for purposes
of the Transactions.
