or hourly wage, current target bonus opportunity, other material compensation

employment as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or otherwise, has not notified any Company Party of such
Person's intention to terminate, nor given any Company Party any express
indication that such Person will terminated such employment before or after
the Closing.

  



  

5.14.3 Except as set forth on _Schedule_ _5.14.3_ , no Company has entered
into any employment agreement with any Employee, and all Employees may be
terminated at will. Except as set forth on _Schedule_ _5.14.3_ , there is no
contractual obligation or special termination or severance arrangement in
respect of any of the Employees (including any Former Employee) and there is
no provision of any agreement or arrangement with any of the Employees

requirement, which would obligate any Company to employ any of the Employees
(or any time in the two years prior to the Closing Date was a party to, had an
obligation or other arrangement with respect to, or was bound by). The Company
Parties have provided Buyers with true, correct and complete copies of each
such employment agreement (or a complete written description thereof if the

exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act and state and local wage and hour
Laws are properly classified.

including for the purposes of Tax withholding Laws or any under any benefit
plan, with respect to any misclassification of a Person as an independent
contractor rather than as an employee or with respect to any employees
"leased" from another entity. No Person who is not an Employee of a Company
has made or, to the Company Parties Knowledge, threatened any claim that such
Person is or should be classified as an Employee of a Company under applicable
Law, and there is no basis for any liability of the Companies arising from the

 **9.3 Transfer Taxes**. All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with
the transfer and conveyance of the Transferred Assets shall be borne by the
Sellers. If Buyers, or after Closing, the Companies shall be required to make

Returns with respect to the Transferred Assets (the " _Payor_ "), the Payor
shall notify the Sellers in writing of the Transfer Tax shown on such filings,
reports and Tax Returns and how such Transfer Tax was calculated. The Sellers
shall promptly reimburse the Payor the amount of such Transfer Tax
attributable to the Transferred Assets in immediately available funds within
10 Business Days of receipt of such notice.

  



  

 **9.4 Allocation of Taxes.**

  



  

9.4.1 _Property Taxes_. All Property Taxes (for the avoidance of doubt,
other than Transfer Taxes) levied with respect to the Assets for the Straddle
Period shall be apportioned between the Buyers and the Sellers based on the
number of days of such Straddle Period included in the Pre-Closing Period and
the number of days of such Straddle Period included in the Post-Closing
Period. The Sellers shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such
Property Taxes that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Period, and the Buyers
shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such Property Taxes that is
attributable to the Post-Closing Period. With respect to tangible personal
property that is owned by the Companies as of the Closing Date, Sellers shall
be credited with any Property Taxes paid by the Companies prior to the Closing
Date in respect of Property Taxes not yet assessed by the applicable
Governmental Authority. Property Taxes that relate to a fiscal year ending
prior to the Closing Date shall be the responsibility of the Sellers. All
installments of Property Taxes having a due date before the Closing Date shall
be paid by each Company before the Closing Date, and the Buyers will cause the
Companies to pay all installments of Property Taxes having a due date on or
after the Closing Date. At the Closing, the net amount of all Property Tax
adjustments computed according to this _Section_ _9.4.1_ , based upon which
party is responsible for such Property Taxes and which party is to pay such
Property Taxes, shall be added to or deducted from the Purchase Price. If
current tax statements for any Property Taxes for a Straddle Period are not
available as of the Closing Date, the prior year's tax statements will be used
for purposes of making an estimated proration at the Closing, and a final
proration will be made promptly when the current tax statements for such
Property Taxes are received. The Sellers shall remit to the Buyers any
additional amounts due to the Buyers in such regard within 10 Business Days of
receipt of written notice thereof from the Buyers (which notice shall include
reasonable evidence of the Taxes owed). The Buyers shall remit to the Sellers
any excess amounts previously remitted hereunder within 10 Business Days of
receipt of written notice thereof from the Sellers (which notice shall include
reasonable evidence of the Taxes owed). If the Sellers, from and after the
Closing, receive any bill, assessment or other notice of any such Property
Taxes due for any Straddle Period, the Sellers shall promptly forward a copy
of such bill, assessment or other notice to the Buyers.

  



  

9.4.2 _Other Taxes_. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any
Straddle Period, (a) Taxes of the Companies (other than Property Taxes)
allocable to the Pre-Closing Period shall be computed as if such taxable
period ended prior to the Closing Date, and (b) any Taxes in the form of
interest, penalties, additions to tax or additional amounts that relate to
Taxes for any period, or a portion of any period, ending before the Closing
Date shall be treated as occurring prior to the Closing Date whether such
items are incurred, accrued, assessed or similarly charged on, before or after
the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, and for the avoidance of doubt, all amount deducted from the
Purchase Price (excluding Escrow Amount and the Equipment Adjustment Amount)
pursuant to _Section_ _3.3_ shall be accrued and reported as an expense of the
Companies allocated to the Pre-Closing Period, and none of the parties will
take a position inconsistent therewith for Tax purposes.

9.4.3 _Tax Returns and Payments_.

  



  

(a) At the Sellers' sole expense, the Sellers will prepare or cause to be
prepared all income Tax Returns of any Company for taxable periods ending
prior to or on the Closing Date for which the original due date (including
extensions) is after the Closing Date and any short- period returns for
taxable periods ending prior to the Closing Date, which includes, for clarity,
the final IRS Form 1065 of ASC and CP (the " _Seller Returns_ "), and such
Seller Returns will include the income, operations or property of the Company,
for the Pre-Closing Period. For the avoidance of doubt, for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year of ASC and CP will be deemed to have ended on the
day immediately before the Closing Date, and none of the parties will take a
position inconsistent therewith for Tax purposes. Each such Seller Return will
be prepared in a manner consistent with the Companies' past practice except as
otherwise required by Law or this Agreement, and in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement. The Sellers will deliver to Buyers, for Buyers'
review and comment, each such Seller Return at least 45 days prior to its due
date. Buyers will provide any written comments on each such Seller Return
within 20 days of receipt of such Seller Return. Buyers and the Sellers will
endeavor in good faith for a period of 10 days after receipt of such comments
to resolve any disputes with respect thereto. In the event that Buyers and the
Sellers are not able to resolve all such disputes in such 10-day period, then
either Buyers or the Sellers may at any time thereafter submit any remaining
disputed items by an independent accounting firm chosen by both Buyers and the
Sellers (" _Tax Arbiter_ "). If all disputes with respect to such Seller
Return are not resolved prior to the due date (including extensions) for such
Seller Return, then such Seller Return will be filed incorporating Buyers'
comments, and such Seller Return will be amended or otherwise refiled to
reflect the determination of the Tax Arbiter. The costs, fees and expenses of
the Tax Arbiter will be shared equally by Buyers and Sellers.

  



  

(b) The Companies will prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, all Tax Returns of the Companies, other than the Seller Returns, for a
Pre-Closing Period (including a Straddle Period) which are to be filed by any
Company after the Closing Date (the " _Company Returns_ "). Each such Company
Return will be prepared in a manner consistent with the Company's past
practice except as otherwise required by Law or this Agreement, and in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and the Sellers will timely
pay to Buyers not less than five days prior to the due date for such Taxes, in
the case of any such Company Return for a Tax period ending before the Closing
Date, all Taxes reflected as due and payable by any Company on all such
Company Returns or, in the case of any such Company Return for a Straddle
Period, the portion of Taxes reflected as due and payable on all such Company
Returns that are allocable to the Pre-Closing Period. Buyers will deliver to
the Sellers, for the Sellers' review and comment, any Company Return that
could reasonably be expected to result in an indemnity obligation of the
Sellers for Taxes at least 30 days (or such shorter period as reasonably
required by circumstances or the nature of the applicable Tax Return) prior to
its due date. The Sellers will provide any written comments on each such
Company Return within 15 days (or such shorter period as reasonably required
by circumstances or the nature of the applicable Tax Return) of receipt of
such Company Return, and Buyers will consider in good faith any such comments
that are reasonable.

(a) After the Closing Date, Buyers and the Sellers, respectively, will
inform the other party in writing of the commencement of any Tax Contest
against or with respect to any Company relating in whole or in part to a Pre-
Closing Period for which Buyers may be entitled to indemnity from the Sellers
under this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Subject to _Section_ ___9.4.4(c)_ , after the Closing Date, Buyers
will have the exclusive right to represent the interests of the Companies in
any and all such Tax Contests; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent
that any such Tax Contest could reasonably be expected to result in a Tax
indemnification liability of the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement, (A)
Buyers will keep the Sellers reasonably informed and consult in good faith
with the Sellers with respect to any such Tax Contest (and the Sellers' Tax
counsel or Tax adviser, at Sellers' expense, will be permitted to attend
meetings with Taxing Authorities) and (B) Buyers will provide the Sellers with
copies of all material correspondence, notices and other written materials
received from any Taxing Authorities and will otherwise keep the Sellers
informed on a reasonable basis of significant developments in such Tax Contest
and of material communications involving representatives of the Taxing
Authorities.

  



  

(c) The Sellers will have the right, at the Sellers' sole cost and
expense, to control and settle the portion of any Tax Contest for which the
Sellers may be required to indemnify a Buyers Indemnitee; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (A) Buyers will have the right to participate in any such Tax
Contest, (B) the Sellers will keep Buyers reasonably informed and consult in
good faith with Buyers with respect to any such Tax Contest (and Buyers' Tax
counsel or Tax adviser, at Buyers' expense, will be permitted to attend
meetings with Taxing Authorities), (C) the Sellers will provide Buyers with
copies of all material correspondence, notices and other written materials
received from any Taxing Authorities and will otherwise keep Buyers informed
on a reasonable basis of significant developments in such Tax Contest and of
material communications involving representatives of the Taxing Authorities,
and (D) the Sellers will not settle, compromise or resolve any such Tax
Contest without Buyer's prior written consent, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that
for any Tax Contest that is subject to the Partnership Tax Audit Rules, ASC
and CP will make an election under Section 6226(a) of the Code (regarding the
"push out" election) with respect to any Imputed Underpayment arising with
respect to any such taxable year, or portion thereof, unless the Sellers
either (I) fully comply with the procedures of Section 6225(c)(2)(A) of the
Code (regarding the filing of amended returns or the alternative procedure to
filing amended returns, respectively), or (II) pay to Buyers the Sellers'
entire allocable share of any Imputed Underpayment, which in either event will
be completed within 40 days after the notice of final partnership adjustments.

  



  

(d) In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this
_Section_ _9.4.4_ and any provision of _Section_ _12.5_ , this _Section_
_9.4.4_ will control.

  



  

9.4.5 _Partnership Tax Audit Rules_. No Seller will cause ASC or CP to
elect to apply the Partnership Tax Audit Rules for any taxable period
beginning prior to January 1, 2018.

  



  

9.4.6 _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, the Sellers,
on the one hand, and Buyers, on the other hand, shall (and, if requested to do
so, each shall cause their respective Affiliates to) (a) assist each other in
preparing any Tax Returns that any other party hereto is responsible for
preparing and filing; (b) cooperate fully in preparing for or defending
against any Tax Contests with taxing authorities relating to any Tax Returns
of the Companies for the Pre-Closing Period; (c) make available to the other
parties hereto and to any Taxing Authority as reasonably requested all

 **9.5 Notification of Certain Matters**. Prior to the Closing, Buyers,
on the one hand, and the Company Parties (in addition to their obligation
under _Section_ _7.8_ ), on the other hand, shall reasonably promptly notify
each other in writing of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event or
the existence of any fact or condition that would cause any condition set

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement commenced or

other written material communication from any Governmental Authority in

that a party's good-faith failure to comply with this _Section_ _9.5_ shall
not provide any other party the right not to consummate the Closing or to
effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

 **9.6 Run-Off Period**.

  



  

9.6.1 From and after the Closing, the Companies may receive and, for a
period of 90 days following the Closing (the " _Run-off Period_ ") shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to collect in the ordinary course of business,
funds in payment or satisfaction of (a) Pre-Closing Accounts Receivable, (b)

shall provide the Sellers with a written statement identifying in reasonable
detail (i) funds actually received by the Companies in payment of Pre-Closing
Accounts Receivable, Pre-Closing Warranty Claims, and Excluded Insurance
Proceeds for such period (the aggregate amount received is the " _Pre Closing
Assets Amount_ "), and (ii) amounts paid by or on behalf of the Companies in
satisfaction of Pre-Closing Accounts Payable for such period (such aggregate
amount is the " _Pre-Closing Liabilities Amount_ ").

  



  

9.6.3 If the Pre-Closing Assets Amount is _**greater**_ than the Pre-
Closing Liabilities Amount after either measurement period described in
_Section_ _9.6.2_ , the Companies shall pay to the Sellers not later than 10

traded in the over the counter market so long as such party is not involved in
the business of said corporation and such party does not own more than 5% of
the stock of such corporation. With respect to the Territory, each Seller

public domain through no wrongful act on the part of any Seller. Each Seller
acknowledges that the Confidential Information is vital, sensitive,
confidential and proprietary to the Business.

  



  

 **10.6 Enforceability; Blue Pencil**. Each Seller recognizes that the
territorial, time and scope limitations set forth in this _Article 10_ are
reasonable and are properly required for the protection of Buyers' legitimate
interest in client relationships, goodwill and trade secrets of the Business.

time or scope limitations to such an area, period or scope as said court shall
deem reasonable under the circumstances. If such partial enforcement is not
possible, the provision shall be deemed severed, and the remaining provisions
of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

event of a Seller's actual or threatened breach of any of the provisions
contained in this _Article 10_ , Buyers will have no adequate remedy at law.

 **11.2 Effect of Termination**. Except as otherwise set forth in this
_Section_ _11.2_ or _Section 11.3_ , in the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ _11.1_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, without any liability on the part of any party hereto
or its respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, partners,
managers, members or stockholders, subject to the immediately succeeding
sentence and other than liability of a party for any willful and material
breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such termination. The provisions
of _Article_ _1_ (Defined Terms), this _Section_ _11.2_ , _Section 11.3_ and
_Article 13_ (Miscellaneous).

Company Parties under _Section_ ___11.1.3(b)_ , Buyers shall pay to the
Sellers Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) as liquidated damages (the "
_Liquidated Damages_ "). The parties intend that the Liquidated Damages
constitute compensation for Buyers' breach of this Agreement and not a
penalty. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Sellers' harm caused by
Buyers would be impossible or very difficult to accurately estimate, and that
the Liquidated Damages are a reasonable estimate of the anticipated or actual
harm that might arise from the Sellers' harm caused by Buyers. If the Company
Parties terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ ___11.1.3(b)_ ,
notwithstanding anything contained in _Article 13_ or elsewhere to the
contrary, Buyers' payment of the Liquidated Damages to the Company Parties is
the exclusive remedy available to the Company Parties for Buyers' breach
hereunder.

connection with claims for indemnification under _Section 12.2(a)_ shall be
satisfied by the Sellers solely and exclusively from the then remaining

12.4.3 _Deductible_.

  



  

(a) No indemnification payments shall be made to the Buyer Indemnitees
with respect to claims for indemnification under _Section 12.2(a)_ unless the

12.2(a)_ exceeds the Deductible, whereupon, subject to _Section_ _12.4.1_ ,
the Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover the entire amount of such

indemnification under _Section 12.2(b)_ , _12.2(c)_ , _12.2(d)_ , _12.2(_ _e_

with respect to claims for indemnification under _Section 12.3_ _(a)_ unless

shall be entitled to recover the entire amount of such Losses and not only
amounts in excess of the Deductible. Claims for indemnification under _Section
12.3(b)_ and _Section 12.3(c)_ shall not be subject to the Deductible.

Indemnitee, the Sellers, and with respect to a Seller Indemnitee, Buyer, in
writing of such claim, describing such claim in reasonable detail and the
amount or estimated amount of Losses (a " _Claims Notice_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any failure or delay on the part of the Indemnitee to deliver
such a Claims Notice shall not relieve the applicable Indemnitors of their
obligations under this _Article 12_ , except if, and only to the extent, that
such failure or delay prejudices such Indemnitors.

12.5.2 With respect to any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation,
demand or other claim against an Indemnitee by a third party (a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), the Indemnitors shall have 10 Business Days after the date the
Indemnitor receives the Claims Notice to notify the Indemnitee in writing that
the Indemnitor desires to assume control of the defense or prosecution of the
Third Party Claim and any litigation resulting therefrom (a " _Defense
Assumption Notice_ "). By delivering a Defense Assumption Notice to the
Indemnitee, the Indemnitor is confirming that (a) it is obligated to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Indemnitee under terms of their
indemnification obligations hereunder (and subject to the limitations on the
indemnification obligations set forth herein) and (b) that it will undertake,
conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing (which counsel shall
be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee) and at its own expense, the
settlement or defense thereof and in which event the Indemnitee shall
cooperate with it in connection therewith. If the Indemnitor delivers a
Defense Assumption Notice to the Indemnitee: (i) the Indemnitee may retain
separate co-counsel at the Indemnitee's sole cost and expense and participate
in the defense of such Third Party Claim, but the Indemnitor shall control the
investigation, defense and settlement thereof; (ii) the Indemnitee shall not
file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnitor; and (iii) the Indemnitor shall not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee unless the
judgment or settlement provides solely for the payment of money and the
applicable Indemnitees receive an unconditional release with respect to such
Third Party Claim. The parties shall act in good faith in responding to,
defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with Third Party Claims, and
cooperate in any such defense and give each other reasonable access to all
information relevant thereto and shall keep each other reasonably informed
with respect to the status thereof. Whether or not the Indemnitor has assumed
the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor will not be obligated to
indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder with respect to any settlement entered into
or any judgment consented to without the Indemnitor's prior written consent.

  



  

12.5.3 If the Indemnitor does not assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim within 10 Business Days of receipt of the Claims Notice, the Indemnitee
will be entitled to assume such defense, at its sole cost and expense (it
being understood that the Indemnitor shall remain liable to the extent such
costs and expenses constitute a Loss for which the Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _Article 12_ ), upon delivery of notice to such
effect to the Indemnitor; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitor shall
have the right to participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim at its
sole cost and expense.

  



  

12.5.4 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitor shall not have the
right to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, if (a) the claim seeks
an injunction or other equitable relief, (b) the Indemnitee shall have been
advised by counsel that there are one or more legal or equitable defenses
available to them which are different from or in addition to those available
to the Indemnitor, and, in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnitee, counsel
for the Indemnitor could not adequately represent the interests of the
Indemnitee because such interests could be in conflict with those of the
Indemnitor, (c) the Indemnitor fails to provide the Indemnitee with reasonable
evidence that the Indemnitor has the financial wherewithal to pay for such
defense, (d) the Indemnitor shall not have assumed the defense of such Third
Party Claim within the required time period, (e) such Third Party Claim is
brought by the Indemnitee's customers, suppliers, lenders, equityholders,
employees or other business relationships, (f) the Third Party Claim involves
a criminal matter or (g) with respect to claims under _Section 12.2(a)_ or
_Section 12.2(b)_ , if the reasonable potential Losses involved in such Third
Party Claim exceed the amount then remaining in the Escrow Fund.

12.5.5 To the extent there is any inconsistency between this _Section
12.5_ and _Section_ _9.3_ or _9.4_ as it relates to a Tax matter, the
provisions of _Sections_ _9.3_ and _9.4_ shall govern.

  



  

 **12.6 Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims**. The
Indemnitee will deliver a Claims Notice to the Indemnitor promptly upon its
discovery of any matter for which the Indemnitor may be liable to the
Indemnitee hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim, which Claims
Notice shall state that the Indemnitee has paid or properly accrued Losses or
anticipates that it will incur liability for Losses for which such Indemnitee
is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement. The Indemnitee
shall reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnitor in determining the
validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnitee and in otherwise
resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation shall include
providing reasonable access to and copies of information, records and
documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the
investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and
business assistance with respect to such matters.

  



  

 **12.7 Exclusive Remedy**.

  



  

12.7.1 The indemnification obligations of the Sellers with respect to
claims for indemnification under _Section 12.2(a)_ and _12.2(b)_ shall first
be satisfied through recourse to the amounts then remaining in the Escrow
Fund, if any. The Sellers shall be jointly and severally liable to the Buyer
Indemnitees for (i) to the extent there are no funds then remaining in the
Escrow Fund, Losses arising in connection with claims for indemnification
under _Section 12.2(b)_ and (ii) Losses arising in connection with claims for
indemnification under _Sections 12.2(c)_ , _12.2(d)_ , _12.2(e)_ and _12_ _.2_
_(_ _f_ _)_.

  



  

12.7.2 The Escrow Fund and Buyers' rights under the RandW Insurance Policy
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnitees in respect of
Losses arising in connection with claims for indemnification under _Section_
_12.2_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section_ _12.7.2_ shall not apply
to (i) Losses arising in connection with claims for indemnification under
_Section 12.2(b)_ , _12.2(c)_ , _12.2(d)_ , _12.2(e)_ or _12.2(_ _f_ _)_ ,
(ii) Losses arising in connection with claims for indemnification based on the
fraud, criminal activity or willful misconduct of a Company Party in
connection with the representations and warranties made by such Company Party
in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto, as qualified
by the Schedules, or (iii) Losses arising in connection with claims pursuant
to any Transaction Document other than this Agreement.

  



  

12.7.3 The Escrow Amount and any interest accrued thereon (collectively,
the " _Escrow Fund_ ") shall be held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement. The Escrow Fund shall
be held until the earlier of (a) the exhaustion of the Escrow Fund and (b) the
Cut-Off Date. Any portion of the Escrow Fund remaining on the day following
the Cut-Off Date shall be released to the Sellers, less the sum of the
aggregate amount, if any, claimed by the Buyer Indemnitees under _Section
12.2.(a)_ or _12(b)_ pursuant to claims (such claims, the " _Outstanding
Claims_ ") properly made against the Escrow Fund in accordance with this
_Article 12_ and not fully resolved prior to the Cut-Off Date, which amount
shall be retained by the Escrow Agent (such amount of the retained Escrow
Fund, as it may be further reduced after the Cut-Off Date by distributions to
the Companies as set forth below and by recoveries by the Buyer Indemnitees
pursuant to _Section 12.2.(a)_ and _12.2(b)_ and the Escrow Agreement, the "
_Retained Escrow Amount_ "). In the event and to the extent that, after the
Cut-Off Date, any Outstanding Claim is resolved by the Sellers and the Buyer
Indemnitee or finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (i) the
Sellers and Buyers shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to promptly release
from the Escrow Fund _**to the Sellers**_ , in accordance with payment
instructions provided by the Sellers, an aggregate amount of the Retained
Escrow Amount equal to any amount of the Outstanding Claim resolved against
such Buyer Indemnitee, and (ii) the Sellers and Buyers shall jointly instruct
the Escrow Agent to promptly release from the Escrow Fund _**to Buyer**_ , in
accordance with payment instructions provided by Buyers, an aggregate amount
of the Retained Escrow Amount equal to any amount of the Outstanding Claim
resolved in favor of such Buyer Indemnitee.

12.7.4 _Calculation of Losses; Limitations_. The amount of any Loss for
which indemnification is provided under this _Article 12_ shall be net of any
amounts actually recovered by any Indemnitee under insurance policies
(including any representation and warranty insurance policy maintained by or
for the benefit of the Sellers prior to the Closing (other than the RandW
Insurance Policy)), and from third parties or otherwise with respect to such
Loss (net of direct collection expenses and any increase in premiums under
insurance policies to the extent attributable to the recovery of such
proceeds). With respect to any matter giving rise to a claim for
indemnification in this _Article 12,_ should an Indemnitee receive the amounts
described in the preceding sentence after such time as the Indemnitor has made
payment to the Indemnitee with respect to such matter, the Indemnitee shall
promptly pay any such amounts to the Indemnitor. In the event any Indemnitee
determines it is entitled to insurance proceeds (including proceeds under any
representation and warranty insurance policy maintained by or for the benefit
of the Sellers prior to the Closing (other than the RandW Insurance Policy)) or
any other third-party recoveries in respect of any Losses (or any of the
circumstances giving rise thereto) for which such Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article 12_ , such Indemnitee shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, receive or realize such proceeds,
payments or recoveries.

  



  

 **12.8 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments**. Unless otherwise
required by applicable Law, any indemnity payment made under this Agreement
shall be treated by all parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all
federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes, and the parties shall file
their Tax Returns accordingly.

  



  

 **12.9 Determination of Breaches and Losses**. For purposes of this
_Article 12_ , references to the terms "material," "in all material respects,"
Material Adverse Effect or any similar term or phrase contained in any
representation or warranty shall be disregarded (a) for purposes of
determining whether there has been any breach of any representation or
warranty in this Agreement (except for the representations and warranties in
_Sections 5.1_ (Organization), _5.12_ (Contracts), _5.17_ (Licenses and
Permits), _5.22_ (Conduct of the Business) and _5.27_ (Information Supplied)),
and (b) for purposes of determining the amount of Losses resulting therefrom.

  



  

 **12.10 Effect of Investigation**. A claim for indemnity may be made by
the Indemnitees under _Section_ _12.2_ or _Section_ _12.3_ despite the fact
that such Indemnitee had actual knowledge prior to the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, of the breach of, or of any facts or circumstances constituting or
resulting in the breach of, such representation or warranty. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each party hereto shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall be
deemed to have relied upon, all representations, warranties and covenants of
each other party set forth in this Agreement which have been or are made in
favor of such party, and the rights of Indemnitees under this _Article 12_
shall not be affected, notwithstanding (a) any investigation or examination
conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) about the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation made
by or on behalf of the parties hereto, (b) the waiver of any condition based
on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or

 **12.11 Resolution of Disputes Under Article 12**. Any controversy or
claim arising out of or relating to this _Article 12_ or the breach,
termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, shall be
submitted to and determined by arbitration before one arbitrator mutually
agreed upon by the parties. If the parties cannot reach an agreement on the
arbitrator within 30 days after each party has submitted names of potential
arbitrators, then the arbitrator shall be chosen by the Judicial Arbitration
and Mediation Service (JAMS). If selected by JAMS, the arbitrator shall either
be a retired Texas state court judge or an attorney with at least 15-years'
experience in transactions of the type provided for in this Agreement. The
arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive
Arbitration Rules and Procedures and shall take place in Dallas, Texas.
Judgment on any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This
clause shall not preclude the parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid
of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. This arbitration
provision shall not preclude any Indemnitee from joining an Indemnitor or
pursuing a third party complaint against an Indemnitor in connection with a
Third Party Claim in the event the Indemnitor does not assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim in accordance with this _Article 12_ , but the failure
to so join or pursue a third party complaint shall not waive, release, or
otherwise adversely affect any right to commence arbitration under this
section.

agreement hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to
any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach or affect in any
way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.
No waiver by any of the parties of any of the provisions hereof shall be
effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and executed by the party
sought to be charged with such waiver. Notwithstanding anything to the
