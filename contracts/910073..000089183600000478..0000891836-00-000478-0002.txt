-v-       AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 
----------------------------   This is an AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER,
dated as of the 27th day of June, 2000 ("Agreement"), by and between QUEENS
COUNTY BANCORP, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Queens"), and HAVEN BANCORP,
INC., a Delaware corporation ("Haven").   INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT   The
Board of Directors of each of Queens and Haven (i) has determined that this
Agreement and the business combination and related transactions contemplated
hereby are in the best interests of Queens and Haven, respectively, and in
the best long-term interests of their respective stockholders, (ii)
has determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
are consistent with, and in furtherance of, their respective business
strategies and (iii) has approved, at meetings of each of such Boards of
Directors, this Agreement.   Concurrently with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Queens\' willingness
to enter into this Agreement, Queens and Haven have entered into a stock
option agreement ("Option Agreement"), pursuant to which Haven has granted to
Queens an option to purchase shares of Haven\'s common stock, par value $.01
per share ("Haven Common Stock"), upon the terms and conditions contained
therein.   The parties hereto intend that the Merger shall qualify as
a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code"), for federal income tax
purposes.   Queens and Haven desire to make certain representations,
warranties and agreements in connection with the business combination and
related transactions provided for herein and to prescribe various conditions
to such transactions.   In consideration of their mutual promises and
obligations hereunder, the parties hereto adopt and make this Agreement and
prescribe the terms and conditions hereof and the manner and basis of
carrying it into effect, which shall be as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE
MERGER  ----------   Section 1.1. Structure of the Merger. On the Effective
Date (as defined herein), Haven will merge with and into Queens ("Merger"),
with Queens being the surviving entity, pursuant to the provisions of, and
with the effect provided in, the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL").
Subject to the receipt of any necessary clearances, the parties intend that
the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "New York Community Bancorp,
Inc." (or a variation thereof acceptable to Queens). Upon consummation of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Haven shall cease. Queens shall
continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, and its
separate corporate existence, with all of its rights, privileges, immunities,
powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger. Queens may at
any time prior to the Effective Time change      the method of effecting
the combination with Haven (including, without limitation, the provisions of
this Article I) if and to the extent it deems such change to be necessary or
appropriate; provided, however, that no such change shall (1) alter or change
the amount or kind of consideration to be issued to holders of Haven Common
Stock as provided for in this Agreement, (2) adversely affect the tax
treatment of Haven or Haven\'s stockholders as a result of receiving the
Merger Consideration (as defined herein), (3) materially impede or delay
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
(4) adversely effect the obligations of Queens hereunder. In the event of
such an election, the parties agree to execute an appropriate amendment to
this Agreement in order to reflect such election.   Section 1.2. Effect on
Outstanding Shares of Haven Common Stock. 
--------------------------------------------------   (a) By virtue of the
Merger, automatically and without any action on the part of the holders of
Haven Common Stock, each share of Haven Common Stock issued and outstanding
at the Effective Time (as defined herein), other than (i) shares held
directly or indirectly by Queens (other than shares held in a fiduciary
capacity or in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted), (ii) shares
held by Haven as treasury stock and (iii) unallocated shares held in
the Amended and Restated Columbia Federal Savings Bank Recognition and
Retention Plan for Officers and Employees and the Amended and Restated
Columbia Federal Savings Bank Recognition and Retention Plan for Outside
Directors (collectively, "Haven RRPs") (such shares referred to in clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to herein as the "Excluded Shares"),
together with the related preferred share purchase right ("Haven Preferred
Share Purchase Right") issued pursuant to the Stockholder Rights Agreement
("Haven Rights Agreement"), dated as of January 25, 1996, between Haven and
Chemical Bank, as Rights Agent, to the extent that they shall exist, shall
become and be converted into the right to receive 1.04 shares (the "Exchange
Ratio") of Queens common stock par value $0.01 per share ("Queens Common
Stock"), together with the related preferred share purchase right issuable
pursuant to any rights agreement entered into by Queens ("Queens Rights
Agreement") provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, no fraction of a share of Queens Common Stock and no certificates or
scrip therefor will be issued in the Merger; instead Queens shall pay to each
holder of Haven Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of
a share of Queens Common Stock an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest
cent, determined by multiplying such fraction by the last reported sale price
of Queens Common Stock on the day immediately preceding the Effective Time.
The shares of Queens Common Stock and any cash for fractional shares
are collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "Merger
Consideration."   At and after the Effective Time, each certificate ("Haven
Certificate") previously representing shares of Haven Common Stock (except as
specifically set forth in this Section 1.2) shall represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. The record holder of such outstanding Haven
Certificate shall, after the Effective Date, be entitled to vote the shares
of Queens Common Stock into which the shares of Haven Common Stock evidenced
by such certificate shall have been so converted on any matters on which the
holders of record of Queens Common Stock, as of any date subsequent to the
Effective Date, shall be entitled to vote.   (b) If, between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Queens
Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or
into a different class (or a record date for such a change shall have been
determined) by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of   -2-     shares
(each, a "Stock Adjustment"), the Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted correspondingly to the extent appropriate to reflect the Stock
Adjustment.   (c) As of the Effective Time, each Excluded Share shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no exchange or payment
shall be made with respect thereto. All shares of Queens Common Stock and
Queens Preferred Stock (as defined herein) that are held by Haven, if any,
other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in satisfaction of a debt
previously contracted, shall become treasury stock of Queens.   Section
1.3. Exchange Procedures.  -------------------   (a) Appropriate
transmittal materials (the "Letter of Transmittal") will be mailed within
three business days after the Effective Date to each holder of record of
Haven Common Stock as of the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time,
Queens shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust
company as shall be selected by Queens and reasonably acceptable to Haven
(the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Haven
Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 1.3, an estimated
amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash in lieu of
fractional shares to be paid pursuant to Section 1.2(a), and Queens
shall reserve for issuance with its transfer agent and registrar a sufficient
number of shares of Queens Common Stock to provide for payment of the Queens
Common Stock.   (b) The Letter of Transmittal shall (i) specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Haven Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of Haven Certificates to the Exchange Agent,
(ii) be in a form and contain any other provisions as Queens may reasonably
determine and (iii) include instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of Haven Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon the
proper surrender of Haven Certificates to the Exchange Agent, together with a
properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of
such Haven Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (1)
a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Queens Common Stock
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.2 and (2) a
check in the amount equal to the cash in lieu of fractional shares that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.2(a) and any dividends
or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
1.3(c). Haven Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No
later than 10 business days following receipt of the properly completed
Letter of Transmittal and the requisite Haven Certificates, the Exchange
Agent shall distribute Queens Common Stock and cash as provided herein. The
Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of
ownership with respect to the shares of Queens Common Stock held by it
from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all
dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such
shares for the account of the persons entitled thereto. If there is a
transfer of ownership of any shares of Haven Common Stock not registered in
the transfer records of Haven, the Merger Consideration shall be issued to
the transferee thereof if Haven Certificates representing such Haven Common
Stock are presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required, in the reasonable judgment of Queens and the Exchange Agent, (x) to
evidence and effect such transfer and (y) to evidence that any applicable
stock transfer taxes have been paid.   (c) No interest will be paid on the
cash in lieu of fractional shares. Whenever a dividend or other distribution
is declared by Queens on Queens Common Stock, the record date for which is at
or after the Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions   -3-      on all shares issuable pursuant to this
Agreement, but no dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to Queens Common Stock shall be remitted to any
person entitled to receive shares of Queens Common Stock hereunder until such
person surrenders his or her Haven Certificates in accordance with this
Section 1.3. Upon the surrender of such person\'s Haven Certificates, such
person shall be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions,
without interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect
to shares of Queens Common Stock represented by such person\'s Haven
Certificates.   (d) From and after the Effective Time there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer records of Haven of any shares of Haven
Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Haven Certificates are presented
to Queens, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this Section 1.3.   (e) Any portion of the
aggregate amount of cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 1.2(a), any dividends or other distributions to be paid pursuant to
this Section 1.3 that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of Haven for six
months after the Effective Time, as well as any proceeds from any
investments, shall be repaid by the Exchange Agent to Queens upon the written
request of Queens. After such request is made, any stockholders of Haven who
have not theretofore complied with this Section 1.3 shall look only to Queens
for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Haven
Common Stock such stockholder holds, as determined pursuant to Section 1.2 of
this Agreement, without any interest thereon. If outstanding Haven
Certificates are not surrendered prior to the date on which such
payments would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent
permitted by any abandoned property, escheat or other applicable laws, become
the property of Queens (and, to the extent not in its possession, shall be
paid over to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled to such claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Queens, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former
holder of Haven Common Stock for any amount delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.   (f)
Queens and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon Haven\'s stock
transfer books to establish the identity of those persons entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration, which books shall be conclusive with respect
thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of
stock represented by any Haven Certificate, Queens and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in
escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with
respect to any claims thereto.   (g) If any Haven Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such Haven Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond
in such amount as the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Haven Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Haven Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 1.2.   Section 1.4. Stock Options. 
-------------      -4-        (a) Subject to Section 1.4(b), each
option to purchase shares of Haven Common Stock that has been issued by Haven
and is outstanding at the Effective Time (each, a "Haven Option") pursuant to
the Haven Incentive Stock Option Plan, the Haven Stock Option Plan for
Outside Directors and the Haven Stock Incentive Plan (collectively, the
"Haven Option Plans") shall be converted into an option to purchase shares of
Queens Common Stock as follows:   (i) the aggregate number of shares of
Queens Common Stock issuable  upon the exercise of each converted Haven
Option after the Effective Time  shall be equal to the product of (A) the
Exchange Ratio multiplied by (B)  the number of shares of Haven Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the  Haven Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, such product to be  rounded to the nearest whole share of
Queens Common Stock; and   (ii) the exercise price per share of each
converted Haven Option  shall be equal to the quotient of the exercise price
of such Haven Option  at the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio,
such quotient to be  rounded to the nearest whole cent;  provided, however,
that, in the case of any Haven Option that is intended to qualify as an
incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code, the number of shares of
Queens Common Stock issuable upon exercise of and the exercise price per
share for such converted Haven Option determined in the manner provided above
shall be further adjusted in such manner as Queens may determine to be
necessary to conform to the requirements of Section 424(b) of the
Code. Options to purchase shares of Queens Common Stock that arise from the
operation of this Section 1.4 shall be referred to as the "Converted
Options." All Converted Options shall be exercisable for the same period and
otherwise have the same terms and conditions applicable to Haven Options that
they replace. Prior to the Effective Time, Queens shall take, or cause to be
taken, all necessary action to effect the intent of the provisions set forth
in this Section 1.4.   (b) Notwithstanding Section 1.4(a) and subject to
the provisions of this Section 1.4(b), any Haven Option shall, if so
requested by the option holder, be cancelled and shall cease to be
exercisable. Any such request shall be made in writing in the form and manner
specified by Haven and reasonably acceptable to the Queens and shall be
delivered to the Queens at least ten (10) business days prior to the
Effective Time. In consideration for such cancellation, each holder of a
Haven Option making such request shall be paid, with respect to each Haven
Option so canceled, an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the product of
the Queens Market Value (as defined herein) times the Exchange Ratio over the
price at which the holder may acquire a share of Haven Common Stock upon
exercise of such Haven Option (such excess, the "Option Cashout Payment").
Such payment shall be made as soon as practicable following the Effective
Time or, if later in the case of any holder of a Haven Option, the date on
which such holder delivers to Haven his written acceptance of an
Option Cashout Payment as full and complete consideration for the
cancellation of each Haven Option held by such holder. Haven shall take such
action as is necessary or appropriate under the terms of Haven\'s Option
Plans to convert each Haven Option for which such a request is timely made as
of the Effective Time, into the right to receive an Option Cashout Payment
upon the terms and conditions set forth herein. Such payment hereunder shall
be subject to withholding for applicable federal, state and local taxes.  
(c) Prior to the date of Haven stockholders meeting contemplated by Section
4.8, Haven shall take, or cause to be taken, appropriate action under the
terms of any stock option plan,   -5-      agreement or arrangement
under which Haven Options have been granted to provide for the conversion of
Haven Options outstanding at the Effective Time into Converted Options and to
effect any other modifications contemplated by Section 1.4(a).   (d)
Concurrently with the reservation of shares of Queens Common Stock to provide
for the payment of the Merger Consideration, Queens shall take all corporate
action necessary to reserve for future issuance a sufficient additional
number of shares of Queens Common Stock to provide for the satisfaction of
its obligations with respect to the Converted Options. As soon as practicable
following the Effective Time, Queens shall (i) cause to be executed and
delivered to each holder of a Converted Option an agreement, certificate or
other instrument, in such form and of such substance as Queens may reasonably
determine, evidencing such holder\'s rights with respect to the Converted
Options; and (ii) file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor
or other appropriate form) and make any state filings or obtain
state exemptions with respect to the Queens Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the Converted Options.   Section 1.5. Directors and Officers of
Queens after Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the directors and
officers of Queens shall consist of (a) the directors and officers of Queens
serving immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b) such additional
persons who shall become directors or officers of Queens as contemplated by
Section 4.13 and any employment agreements entered into by and between Queens
and any officer of Haven.   Section 1.6. Certificate of Incorporation and
By-laws. The Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of Queens immediately
after the Merger shall be those of Queens as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, except as may be affected by the proposed change of name
of Queens.   -6-       ARTICLE II   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
------------------------------   Section 2.1. Disclosure Letters. On or
prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Haven and Queens each
shall have delivered to the other a letter (each, its "Disclosure Letter")
setting forth, among other things, facts, circumstances and events the
disclosure of which is required or appropriate in relation to any or all of
their respective representations and warranties (and making specific
reference to the Section of this Agreement to which they relate); provided,
that (a) no such fact, circumstance or event is required to be set forth in
the Disclosure Letter as an exception to a representation or warranty if its
absence is not reasonably likely to result in the related representation or
warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect under the standards established by
Section 2.2 and (b) the mere inclusion of a fact, circumstance or event in a
Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission by a party that such item
represents a material exception or that such item is reasonably likely to
result in a Material Adverse Effect (as defined herein).   Section 2.2.
Standards.  ---------   (a) No representation or warranty of Haven or
Queens contained in Sections 2.3 or 2.4, respectively, shall be deemed untrue
or incorrect, and no party hereto shall be deemed to have breached a
representation or warranty, on account of the existence of any fact,
circumstance or event unless, as a direct or indirect consequence of such
fact, circumstance or event, individually or taken together with all other
facts, circumstances or events inconsistent with any paragraph of Sections
2.3 or 2.4, as applicable, there is reasonably likely to exist a Material
Adverse Effect (as defined herein). Haven\'s representations, warranties and
covenants contained in this Agreement shall not be deemed to be untrue or
breached as a result of effects arising solely from actions taken
in compliance with a written request of Queens.   (b) As used in this
Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" means either (i) an effect
which is material and adverse to the business, financial condition or results
of operations of Haven or Queens, as the context may dictate, and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole; provided, however, that any such effect
resulting from any (A) changes in laws, rules or regulations or
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") or interpretations thereof
that apply to both Queens and Queens County Savings Bank, a New York State
chartered savings bank ("Queens Bank") and Haven and CFS Bank, a federally
chartered savings association ("CFS Bank"), as the case may be, or (B)
changes in the general level of market interest rates shall not be considered
in determining if a Material Adverse Effect has occurred; or (ii) the failure
of (x) a representation or warranty contained in Section 2.3(a)(i) and (iv),
Section 2.3(d), Section 2.3(g)(iii), Section 2.4(a)(i) and (iv), Section

contracts, agreements and arrangements, including, but not limited to,
"employee benefit plans," as defined in Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"),
incentive and welfare policies, contracts, plans and arrangements and all
trust agreements related thereto with respect to any present or former
directors, officers or other employees of Haven or any of its Subsidiaries
(hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Haven Employee Plans"). All
Haven Employee Plans comply in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of ERISA, the Code and other applicable laws; there has occurred
no "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code) which is likely to result in the imposition of any material
penalties or taxes under Section 502(i) of ERISA   -13-       or
Section 4975 of the Code upon Haven or any of its Subsidiaries. No
liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") has been or is
expected by Haven or any of its Subsidiaries to be incurred with respect to
any Haven Employee Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA ("Haven Pension
Plan"), or with respect to any "single-employer plan" (as defined in Section
4001(a) of ERISA) currently or formerly maintained by Haven or any entity
which is considered one employer with Haven under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA
or Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"). No Haven Pension Plan had
an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA),
whether or not waived, as of the last day of the end of the most recent plan
year ending prior to the date hereof; the fair market value of the assets of
each Haven Pension Plan exceeds the present value of the "benefit
liabilities" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA) under such Haven
Pension Plan as of the end of the most recent plan year with respect to the
respective Haven Pension Plan ending prior to the date hereof, calculated on
the basis of the actuarial assumptions used in the most recent actuarial
valuation for such Haven Pension Plan as of the date hereof; and no notice of
a "reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for which the
30-day reporting requirement has not been waived has been required to be
filed for any Haven Pension Plan within the 12-month period ending on the
date hereof. Neither Haven nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is
required to provide, security to any Haven Pension Plan or to any single-
employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the
Code. Neither Haven, its Subsidiaries, nor any ERISA Affiliate has
contributed to any "multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA, on or after September 26, 1980. Each Haven Employee Plan that is an
"employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA)
and which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (a
"Haven Qualified Plan") has received a favorable determination letter from
the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), and Haven and its Subsidiaries are not
aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such
favorable determination letter. There is no pending or, to Haven\'s
knowledge, threatened litigation, administrative action or proceeding
relating to any Haven Employee Plan. Except as provided elsewhere in this
Agreement, there has been no announcement or commitment by Haven or any of
its Subsidiaries to create an additional Haven Employee Plan, or to amend any
Haven Employee Plan, except for amendments required by applicable law which
do not materially increase the cost of such Haven Employee Plan; and, Haven
and its Subsidiaries do not have any obligations for post-retirement or post-
employment benefits under any Haven Employee Plan that cannot be amended or
terminated upon 60 days\' notice or less without incurring any liability
thereunder, except for coverage required by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or
Section 4980B of the Code, or similar state laws, the cost of which is borne
by the insured individuals. All contributions required to be made under the
terms of any Haven Employee Plan have been timely made or have been reflected
on Haven\'s Reports. With respect to Haven or any of its Subsidiaries, for
Haven Employee Plans listed in Haven\'s Disclosure Letter, the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not result in any payment or series of payments by
Haven or any of its Subsidiaries to any person which is an "excess parachute
payment" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code), increase or secure (by way
of a trust or other vehicle) any benefits payable under any Haven Employee
Plan or accelerate the time of payment or vesting of any such benefit. With
respect to each Haven Employee Plan, Haven has supplied to Queens a true and
correct copy of (A) the annual report on the applicable form of the Form 5500
series filed with the IRS for the most recent three plan years, if
required to be filed, (B) such Haven Employee Plan, including amendments
thereto, (C) each trust agreement, insurance contract or other funding
arrangement relating to such Haven Employee Plan, including amendments
thereto, (D) the most recent summary plan description and summary of material
modifications thereto for such Haven Employee Plan, if Haven Employee Plan is
subject to Title I of ERISA, (E) the most recent actuarial report or
valuation if such Haven Employee Plan   -14-       is a Haven Pension
Plan and any subsequent changes to the actuarial assumptions contained
therein and (F) the most recent determination letter issued by the IRS if
such Haven Employee Plan is a Haven Qualified Plan.   (n) Title to Assets.
Haven and each of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to its
properties and assets (including any intellectual property asset such as any
trademark, service mark, tradename or copyright) and property acquired in a
judicial foreclosure proceeding or by way of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or
similar transfer, other than property as to which it is lessee, in which case
the related lease is valid and in full force and effect. Each lease pursuant
to which Haven or any of its Subsidiaries is lessor is valid and in full
force and effect, and no lessee under any such lease is in default or in
violation of any provisions of any such lease. All material
tangible properties of Haven and each of its Subsidiaries are in a good state
of maintenance and repair, conform with all applicable ordinances,
regulations and zoning laws and are considered by Haven to be adequate for
the current business of Haven and its Subsidiaries.   (o) Compliance with
Laws. Haven and each of its Subsidiaries has all permits, licenses,
certificates of authority, orders and approvals of, and has made all filings,
applications and registrations with, all Governmental Entities that are
required in order to permit it to carry on its business as it is presently
conducted; all such permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders and
approvals are in full force and effect, and, to the best knowledge of Haven,
no suspension or cancellation of any of them is threatened. Since the date of
its incorporation, the corporate affairs of Haven have not been conducted in
violation of any law, ordinance, regulation, order, writ, rule, decree or
approval of any Governmental Entity. The businesses of Haven and
its Subsidiaries are not being, and have not been conducted in violation of
any law, ordinance, regulation, order, writ, rule, decree or condition to
approval of any Governmental Entity or any policy or procedure.   (p) Fees.

retention of independent contractors and are in compliance with applicable
employment tax laws.   (n) Employee Benefit Plans. Queens\' Disclosure
Letter contains a complete and accurate list as of the date hereof of all
pension, retirement, stock option, stock purchase, stock ownership, savings,
stock appreciation right, profit sharing, deferred compensation, consulting,
bonus, group insurance, severance and other benefit plans, contracts,
agreements and arrangements, including, but not limited to, "employee benefit
plans," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, incentive and welfare policies,
contracts, plans and arrangements and all trust agreements related thereto
with respect to any present or former directors, officers or other employees
of Queens or any of its Subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to collectively as
the "Queens Employee Plans"). All of the Queens Employee Plans comply in all
respects with all applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code and other
applicable laws; there has occurred no "prohibited transaction" (as defined
in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) which is likely to
result in the imposition of any penalties or taxes under Section 502(i) of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code upon Queens or any of its Subsidiaries. No
liability to the PBGC has been or is expected by Queens or any of its
Subsidiaries to be incurred with respect to any Queens Employee Plan which is
subject to Title IV of ERISA ("Queens Pension Plan"), or with respect to any
"single-employer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a) of ERISA) currently or
formerly maintained by Queens or any entity which is considered one employer
with Queens under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an
"ERISA Affiliate"). No Queens Pension Plan had an "accumulated funding
deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA), whether or not waived, as
of the last day of the end of the most recent plan year ending prior to the
date hereof; the fair market value of the assets of each Queens Pension Plan
exceeds the present value of the "benefit liabilities" (as defined in Section
4001(a)(16) of ERISA) under such Queens Pension Plan as of the end of the
most recent plan year with respect to the respective Queens Pension
Plan ending prior to the date hereof, calculated on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions used in the most recent actuarial valuation for such
Queens Pension Plan as   -25-      of the date hereof; and no notice
of a "reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for which the
30-day reporting requirement has not been waived has been required to be
filed for any Queens Pension Plan within the 12-month period ending on the
date hereof. Neither Queens nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is
required to provide, security to any Queens Pension Plan or to any single-
employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the
Code. Neither Queens, its Subsidiaries, nor any ERISA Affiliate
has contributed to any "multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA, on or after September 26, 1980. Each Queens Employee Plan that is an
"employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) and
which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (a "Queens
Qualified Plan") has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS,
and Queens and its Subsidiaries are not aware of any circumstances likely to
result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter. Each Queens
Qualified Plan that is an "employee stock ownership plan" (as defined in
Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code) has satisfied all of the applicable
requirements of Sections 409 and 4975(e)(7) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder in all respects and any assets of any such Queens Qualified Plan
that are not allocated to participants\' individual accounts are pledged as
security for, and may be applied to satisfy, any securities acquisition
indebtedness. There is no pending or, to Queens\' knowledge, threatened
litigation, administrative action or proceeding relating to any Queens
Employee Plan. As of the date of this Agreement, there has been no
announcement or commitment by Queens or any of its Subsidiaries to create an
additional Queens Employee Plan, or to amend any Queens Employee Plan, except
for amendments required by applicable law which do not materially increase
the cost of such Queens Employee Plan; and, Queens and its Subsidiaries do
not have any obligations for post-retirement or post-employment benefits
under any Queens Employee Plan that cannot be amended or terminated upon 60
days\' notice or less without incurring any liability thereunder, except for
coverage required by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code,
or similar state laws, the cost of which is borne by the insured individuals.
With respect to Queens or any of its Subsidiaries, for the Employee Plans
listed in Queens\' Disclosure Letter, the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
not result in any payment or series of payments by Queens or any of its
Subsidiaries to any person which is an "excess parachute payment" (as defined
in Section 280G of the Code), increase or secure (by way of a trust or other
vehicle) any benefits payable under any Queens Employee Plan or
accelerate the time of payment or vesting of any such benefit. All
contributions required to be made under the terms of any Queens Employee Plan
have been timely made or have been reflected on Queens\' Reports. With
respect to each Queens Employee Plan, Queens has supplied to Haven a true and
correct copy of (A) the annual report on the applicable form of the Form 5500
series filed with the IRS for the most recent three plan years, if required
to be filed, (B) such Queens Employee Plan, including amendments thereto, (C)
each trust agreement, insurance contract or other funding arrangement
relating to such Queens Employee Plan, including amendments thereto, (D) the
most recent summary plan description and summary of material modifications
thereto for such Queens Employee Plan, if the Queens Employee Plan is subject
to Title I of ERISA, (E) the most recent actuarial report or valuation if
such Queens Employee Plan is a Queens Pension Plan and any subsequent changes
to the actuarial assumptions contained therein and (F) the most recent
determination letter issued by the IRS if such Queens Employee Plan is a
Queens Qualified Plan.   (o) Title to Assets. Queens and each of its
Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to its properties and assets
(including any intellectual property asset such as any trademark, service
mark, tradename or copyright) and property acquired in a judicial foreclosure
proceeding or by way of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or similar transfer,
other than property as to which it is lessee,   -26-       in which
case the related lease is valid and in full force and effect. Each lease
pursuant to which Queens or any of its Subsidiaries is lessor is valid and in
full force and effect and no lessee under any such lease is in default or
in violation of any provisions of any such lease. All material tangible
properties of Queens and each of its Subsidiaries are in a good state of
maintenance and repair, conform with all applicable ordinances, regulations
and zoning laws and are considered by Queens to be adequate for the current
business of Queens and its Subsidiaries.   (p) Compliance with Laws. Queens
and each of its Subsidiaries has all permits, licenses, certificates of
authority, orders and approvals of, and has made all filings, applications
and registrations with, all Governmental Entities that are required in order
to permit it to carry on its business as it is presently conducted; all such
permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in
full force and effect, and, to the best knowledge of Queens, no suspension or
cancellation of any of them is threatened. Since the date of its
incorporation, the corporate affairs of Queens have not been conducted in
violation of any law, ordinance, regulation, order, writ, rule, decree or

agreements between Queens and Haven, dated as of April 12, 2000 (the

necessary for the proper discharge of its fiduciary duties under applicable
law and (y) the Board of Directors of Haven, after consultation with its
financial advisor, determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal,

account the long-term prospects and interests of Haven and its stockholders.
Haven will notify Queens immediately orally (within one business day) and in
writing (within three business days) if any such Acquisition Proposals are

date hereof, the identity of the person making such inquiry, proposal or
offer and the substance thereof and will keep Queens informed of
any developments with respect thereto immediately upon the occurrence  
-34-      thereof. Subject to the foregoing, Haven will immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
foregoing. Haven will take the necessary steps to inform the appropriate
individuals or entities referred to in the first sentence hereof of the
obligations undertaken in this Section 4.1. Haven will promptly request each
person (other than Queens) that has executed a confidentiality agreement
prior to the date hereof in connection with its consideration of a business
combination with Haven or any of its Subsidiaries to return or destroy all
confidential information previously furnished to such person by or on behalf
of Haven or any of its Subsidiaries.   Section 4.2. Certain Policies of

and practices after the date on which all Requisite Regulatory Approvals and
stockholder approvals are received, and after receipt of written confirmation
from Queens that it is not aware of any fact or circumstance that would
prevent completion of the Merger, and prior to the Effective Time so as to be
consistent on a mutually satisfactory basis with those of Queens Bank;
provided, however, that Haven shall not be required to take such action more
than 30 days prior to the Effective Date; and provided, further, that such

contained in this Agreement shall not be deemed to be untrue or breached in
any respect for any purpose as a consequence of any modifications or changes
undertaken solely on account of this Section 4.2. Queens agrees to hold
harmless, indemnify and defend Haven and its Subsidiaries, and their
respective directors, officers and employees, for any loss, claim, liability

Agreement. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, each of Queens and
Haven will keep confidential, and will cause their respective representatives

any relevant agreement or other document (i) to exempt or continue to exempt

any other persons from the provisions of, Haven Rights Agreement in any
manner that adversely affects Queens or Queens Bank with respect to the
consummation of the Merger or, except as provided in the next sentence,
redeem the rights thereunder; provided, however, that nothing herein shall
prevent Haven from amending or otherwise taking any action under the
Haven Rights Agreement to delay the Distribution Date (as defined in the
Haven Rights Agreement). If requested by Queens, but not otherwise, Haven
will redeem all outstanding Haven Preferred Share Purchase Rights at a
redemption price of not more than $.01 per Haven Preferred Share Purchase

respective corporate documents, to convene a meeting of its respective

consultation with outside legal counsel, in good faith deems such action or
inaction to be legally necessary for the proper discharge of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law the Board of Directors of each of Haven and
Queens shall (a) recommend at its Stockholder Meeting that the stockholders

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.   (ii) Queens
shall cause KPMG, LLP, its independent public accounting firm, to deliver to
Haven, and Haven shall cause KPMG, LLP, its independent public accounting
firm, to deliver to Queens and to its officers and directors who sign the
Registration Statement for this transaction, a "comfort letter" or "agreed

capital stock issuable pursuant to the Registration Statement, or
the initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any
request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Registration
Statement or for additional information. Queens will provide Haven with as
many copies of such Registration Statement and all amendments thereto
promptly upon the filing thereof as Haven may reasonably request.   (b)
Queens shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the
effective date of the Registration Statement, all necessary state securities

properties, businesses or results of operations of such party and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole to which such party or any Subsidiary is a
party or is subject; and (b) any event, condition, change or occurrence which
individually or in the aggregate has, or which, so far as reasonably can be
foreseen at the time of its occurrence, is reasonably likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. Each of Haven and Queens shall give prompt notice to
the other party of any notice or other communication from any third party
alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be required in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  
Section 4.13. Directors and Officers.  ----------------------   (a) Queens
agrees to cause three persons who are members of the Haven Board of Directors
on the date hereof, selected by Queens in its discretion, who are willing so
to serve ("New Queens Directors"), to be elected or appointed as directors of
Queens and two persons who are currently members of the Haven Board of
Directors, selected by Queens in its discretion, who   -39-      are
willing to so serve (" New Queens Bank Directors") to be elected or appointed
to the Board of Directors of Queens Bank at, or as promptly as practicable
after, the Effective Time (such appointment or election of New Queens
Directors and New Queens Bank Directors, respectively, to be as
evenly distributed as possible among the classes of Queens and Queens Bank
directors, respectively). The existing members of the CFS Bank Board of
Directors shall resign as of the Effective Time, and the Board of Directors
of CFS Bank, following the Effective Time, shall include three members of the
Haven Board of Directors as of the date hereof, as selected by Queens in its
discretion, and eight members from among the existing Directors of Queens and
Queens Bank, or otherwise as determined by Queens ("Continuing CFS Bank
Directors"). Queens may, in its discretion, select the same person for more
than one Board position. Queens agrees not to increase the size of the Queens
Board of Directors beyond 11 members for a period of two years following the
Effective Time; provided, however, that Queens may increase the size of the
Queens Board of Directors during such two year period in order to appoint one
or more persons to such board who, immediately prior to such time, were
directors of a financial organization then being acquired by Queens.   (b)
Queens shall honor (i) the Employment Agreements and the Change in Control
Agreements between Haven and, respectively, those persons listed in Section
4.13 of Haven\'s Disclosure Letter, each as amended and restated as of the
date set forth for such person therein and (ii) the Employment Agreements and
the Change in Control Agreements between CFS Bank and, respectively,

Section 4.14. Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance. 
---------------------------------------------------   (a) From and after the
Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date, Queens
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each director and officer of Haven or
any of its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement (each, an
"Indemnified Party"), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (collectively, "Costs") incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the entering into the Option
Agreement), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, and to advance any such Costs to each Indemnified Party as they are
from time to time incurred, in each case to the fullest extent such
Indemnified Party would have been indemnified as a director, officer or
employee of Haven or any of its Subsidiaries under the DGCL.   (b) Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 4.14(a),
upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
shall promptly notify Queens thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not
relieve Queens of any liability it may have hereunder to such Indemnified
Party if such failure does not materially prejudice the indemnifying party.
In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
(i) Queens shall have the right to assume the defense thereof with counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, and Queens shall not be
liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other
counsel subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if Queens does not elect to assume such
defense within a reasonable time or counsel for the Indemnified Party at any
time advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of  
-40-      interest between Queens and the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party may retain counsel satisfactory to such Indemnified Party,
and Queens shall remain responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel as set forth above, to be paid promptly as statements therefor
are received; provided, however, that Queens shall be obligated pursuant to
this paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified
Parties in any one jurisdiction with respect to any given claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation unless the use of one counsel for such
Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest;
(ii) the Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate in the defense of any
such matter; and (iii) Queens shall not be liable for any settlement effected
by an Indemnified Party without its prior written consent, which consent may
not be withheld or delayed unless such settlement is unreasonable in light of
such claims, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations against, or
defenses available to, such Indemnified Party.   (c) Queens shall pay all
reasonable Costs, including attorneys\' fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Party in successfully enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided for in this Section 4.14 to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law. The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be
in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under
applicable law.   (d) For a period of six years after the Effective Time,
Queens shall cause to be maintained in effect for the former directors and
officers of Haven coverage under Queens\' policy of directors and officers
liability insurance no less advantageous to the beneficiaries thereof than
the current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
maintained by Haven; provided, however, that in no event shall Queens be
obligated to expend, in order to maintain or provide insurance coverage
pursuant to this Subsection 4.14(d), any premium per annum in excess of 200%
of the amount of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by Haven for
such insurance ("Maximum Agreement"); provided, further, that if the amount
of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance
coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Queens shall obtain the most
advantageous coverage of directors\' and officers\' insurance obtainable for
an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount; and provided, further,
that officers and directors of Haven may be required to make application and
provide customary representations and warranties to Queens\' insurance
carrier for the purpose of obtaining such insurance.   Section 4.15. Tax-
Free Reorganization Treatment. Prior to the Effective Time, neither Queens
nor Haven shall intentionally take, fail to take, or cause to be taken or not
taken, or cause or permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to take, fail
to take, or cause to be taken or not taken, any action within its control
that would disqualify the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. Subsequent to the Effective Time, Queens shall
not take any action within its control that would disqualify the Merger as a
tax-free reorganization under the Code.   Section 4.16. Employees; Benefit
Plans and Programs.  -------------------------------------   (a) Each
person who is employed by Haven or CFS Bank immediately prior to the
Effective Time (a "Haven Employee") shall, at the Effective Time, become an
employee of Queens or Queens Bank or shall remain an employee of CFS
Bank. Beginning at the Effective Time, each Haven Employee shall serve
Queens, Queens Bank or CFS Bank in the same capacity in which he or she
served immediately prior to the Effective Time and upon the same terms
and   -41-      conditions generally applicable to other employees of
Queens or Queens Bank with comparable positions, with the following special
provisions:   (i) No Haven Employee shall be, or have or exercise the
authority  of, an officer of Queens or Queens Bank unless and until elected
or  appointed an officer of Queens or Queens Bank in accordance with Queens\'

the Effective Time,  Queens and Queens Bank shall establish and implement a
program of  compensation and benefits designed to cover all similarly
situated  employees on a uniform basis ("New Compensation and Benefits
Program"). The  New Compensation and Benefits Program may contain any
combination of new  plans, continuations of plans maintained by Queens or
Queens Bank  immediately prior to the Effective Time and continuation of
plans  maintained by Haven or CFS Bank immediately prior to the Effective
Time as  Queens, in its discretion, may determine. To the extent that it is
not  practicable to implement any constituent part of the New Compensation
and  Benefits Program at the Effective Time, Queens and Queens Bank shall 
continue in effect any comparable plan maintained immediately prior to the 
Effective Time for the respective employees of Queens, Haven, Queens Bank 
and CFS Bank for a transition period. During the transition period, the 
persons who were employees of Haven or CFS Bank immediately prior to the 
Effective Time who become employees of Queens or Queens Bank or remain 
employees of CFS Bank at the Effective Time shall continue to participate  in
the plans of Haven and CFS Bank that are continued for transitional 
purposes, and all other employees of Queens or Queens Bank will participate 
only in the comparable plans of Queens and Queens Bank that are continued 
for transitional purposes.   (iii) Each constituent part of the New
Compensation and Benefits  Program shall recognize, in the case of persons
employed by Queens, Queens  Bank, Haven or CFS Bank immediately prior to the
Effective Time who are  also employed by Queens, Queens Bank or CFS Bank
immediately after the  Effective Time, all service with Queens, Queens Bank,
Haven or CFS Bank as  service with Queens, Queens Bank and CFS Bank for
eligibility,  participation, vesting and all other such purposes except for
purposes of  any post-retirement, health and life insurance benefits.  
(iv) In the case of any constituent part of the New Compensation  and
Benefits Program which is a life, health or long-term disability  insurance
plan: (A) such plan shall not apply any preexisting condition  limitations
for conditions covered under the applicable life, health or  long-term
disability insurance plans maintained by Queens, Queens Bank,  Haven and CFS
Bank as of the Effective Time, (B) each such plan which is a  health
insurance plan shall honor any deductible and out of pocket expenses 
incurred under the applicable life health plans maintained by Queens,  Queens
Bank, Haven and CFS Bank as of the Effective Time and (C) each such  plan
which is a life or long-term disability insurance plan shall waive any 
medical certification otherwise required in order to assure the  continuation
of coverage at a level not less than that in effect  immediately prior to the
implementation of such plan (but subject to any  overall limit on the maximum
amount of coverage under such plans).   (b) (i) Queens shall assume the
obligations of Haven and CFS Bank with respect to any severance plans or
agreements identified in Haven\'s Disclosure Letter, as they may be in  
-42-      effect at the Effective Time, and shall pay amounts thereunder
when due. In the event of the termination of employment of any person who was
an officer or employee of Haven or CFS Bank prior to the Effective Time prior
to the first anniversary of the Effective Time, such person shall only be
eligible for severance benefits under the plans referred to in the preceding
sentence. Thereafter, such person shall be entitled to a severance benefit
under the severance plan maintained by Queens or Queens Bank.   (ii) The
amounts payable under the CFS Bank bonus programs shall be determined for the
period from January 1, 2000 through the Closing Date, except that (A) the
adjusted pre-tax net income and target goals shall be adjusted and pro-rated
for the portion of the year from January 1, 2000 through the Closing Date and
(B) payments thereunder, as so adjusted, shall be made as of the Closing
Date.   (iii) Before the Effective Time, Haven may, in its sole
and absolute discretion, in accordance with applicable law, terminate any
employee stock ownership plan maintained by Haven ("Haven\'s ESOP") and cause
Haven\'s ESOP to sell unallocated shares held in the ESOP to the extent
necessary to pay in full any outstanding ESOP loan. In such event, any
remaining unallocated shares shall be distributed to the accounts of Haven\'s
ESOP participants as investment earnings in proportion to the amount held in
each participant\'s account as of the termination date.   Section 4.17.
Advisory Board. Queens shall, promptly following the Effective Time, cause
all of the members of Haven\'s Board of Directors as of the date of this
Agreement, other than the New Queens Directors, New Queens Bank Directors and

VI   TERMINATION  -----------   Section 6.1. Termination. This Agreement
may be terminated, and the Merger abandoned, at or prior to the Effective
Time, either before or after its approval by the stockholders of Haven and
Queens:   (a) by the mutual consent of Queens and Haven, if the Board
of Directors of each so determines by vote of a majority of the members of
its entire Board;   (b) by Queens or Haven, if its Board of Directors so
determines by vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board, in the
event of (i) the failure of the stockholders of Haven or Queens to approve
the Agreement at its Stockholder Meeting called to consider such approval;
provided, however, that Haven or Queens, as the case may be, shall only be
entitled to terminate the Agreement pursuant to this clause (i) if it has
complied in all material respects with its obligations under Sections 4.8 and
4.9, or (ii) a material breach by the other party hereto of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein which causes
the conditions set forth in Section 5.2(a) (in the case of termination by
Queens) or Section 5.3(a) (in the case of the termination by Haven) not to be
satisfied and such breach is not cured within 25 business days after written
notice of such breach is given to the party committing such breach by the
other party or which breach is not capable of being cured by the date set
forth in Section 6.1(d) or any extension thereof;   (c) by Queens or Haven,
by written notice to the other party, if either (i) any approval, consent or
waiver of a Governmental Entity required to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall have been denied or (ii) any court or
governmental authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final,
unappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;   -47-       (d) by
Queens or Haven, if its Board of Directors so determines by vote of a
majority of the members of its entire Board, in the event that the Merger is
not consummated by March 31, 2001 unless the failure to so consummate by
such time is due to the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate;   (e) by
Haven, if its Board of Directors so determines by a majority vote of the
members of its entire Board, at any time during the five day
period commencing on the Valuation Date, such termination to be effective on
the 15th business day following such Valuation Date, ("Effective Termination
Date") if both of the following conditions are satisfied:   (i) the Queens
Market Value on the Valuation Date is less than an  amount equal to 80% of
the Initial Queens Market Value; and   (ii) the Queens Ratio shall be less
than 0.80 times the Index  Ratio;  subject, however, to the following three
sentences. If Haven elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to this
Section 6.1(e), it shall give prompt written notice thereof to Queens within
five business days of the Valuation Date; provided, that such notice of
election to terminate may be withdrawn at any time prior to the Effective
Termination Date. During the five business day period commencing with its
receipt of such notice, Queens shall have the option to increase the
consideration to be received by the holders of Haven Common Stock hereunder
by adjusting the Exchange Ratio to equal the lesser of (x) a number equal to
a fraction, the numerator of which is 0.832 multiplied by the Initial Queens
Market Value and the denominator of which is the Queens Market Value, and (y)
the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the product of the Index Ratio and the
Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) by (2) the Queens Ratio. If Queens so
elects, it shall give, within such five day period, written notice to Haven
of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no
termination shall be deemed to have occurred pursuant to this Section 6.1(e)
and this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with
its terms (except as the Merger Consideration shall have been so
modified).   For purposes of Section 6.1(e), the following terms shall have

the Valuation Date. In the event that the common stock of any such companies
ceases to be publicly traded or an Acquisition Proposal involving any such
companies is announced at any time during the period beginning on the date of
this Agreement and ending on the Valuation Date, such company will be removed
from the Index Group, and the weights attributed to the remaining companies
will be adjusted proportionately for purposes of determining the Index Price
on the relevant dates. The 25 financial institution holding companies and the
