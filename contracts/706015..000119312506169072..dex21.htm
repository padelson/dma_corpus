v AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of August 9, 2006 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and among INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION, a New York
corporation (" _Parent_ "), NASSAU ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ "), and FILENET CORPORATION,
a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Sub deems it in the
best interests of their respective stockholders to consummate the merger (the
" _Merger_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, of Sub with and into the Company in which the Company would become
a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and such Boards of Directors have
approved this Agreement and declared its advisability (and, in the case of the
Board of Directors of the Company, recommended that this Agreement be adopted
by the Companys stockholders);

WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger;

WHEREAS concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a condition
to the willingness of Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain employees
of the Company are executing offer letters (the " _Offer Letters_ ") regarding
the employment of such employees following the consummation of the Merger;
and

WHEREAS concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a condition
to the willingness of Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain
stockholders and employees of the Company are entering into agreements with
Parent pursuant to which such stockholders and employees shall agree, among
other things, to certain non-competition, non-solicitation and no hire
restrictions.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 

_The Merger_

SECTION 1.01. _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on a date to be specified by the
parties, which shall be not later than the second business day after
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than
those that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, it
being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at Closing), at the offices of
Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019,
unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the
Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that if all the conditions set forth in
Article VI shall not have been satisfied or waived on such second business
day, then the Closing shall take place on the first business day on which all
such conditions shall have been satisfied or waived. The date on which the
Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".

SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time of the Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, as soon as practicable on or
after the Closing Date, the parties shall file a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form as is required by, and executed and
acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at such date and time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or
at such subsequent date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time at which the Merger
becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Effective Time_
".

SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws._ (a) The Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Certificate_ ")
shall be amended at the Effective Time to read in the form of Exhibit A hereto
and, as so amended, the Company Certificate shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until hereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law.

(b) The Bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

SECTION 1.06.  _Directors._ The directors of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.



 

2 SECTION 1.07. _Officers._ The officers of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

ARTICLE II

_Conversion of Securities_

SECTION 2.01. _Conversion of Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares
of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company
Common Stock_ "), or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of common stock
of Sub, par value $0.01 per share, shall be converted into and become one
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ All shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned as treasury stock by the Company or owned
by Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
or deliverable in exchange therefor.

(c)  _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock
(including Restricted Shares (except as otherwise provided in the Offer
Letters)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than (i) shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and
(ii) except as provided in Section 2.01(d), the Appraisal Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive $35.00 in cash, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time such shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The right of any
holder of any share of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger
Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding
that is required under applicable Tax Law, such withholding to be pursuant to
the terms of Section 2.02(f) and any applicable Tax Law.

(d) _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder



 

3 who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead
such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective Time, the
Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Appraisal Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is
not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under
Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). The
Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of
any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of any such demands and any
other related instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company,
and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do
any of the foregoing.

SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the " _Paying Agent_ "), and,
from time to time after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available,
or cause the Surviving Corporation to make available, to the Paying Agent
funds in amounts and at the times necessary for the payment of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) upon surrender of Certificates, it
being understood that any and all interest or other amounts earned with
respect to funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement
shall be turned over to Parent.

(b) _Exchange Procedure._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.



 

4 Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancelation to the Paying Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount
of cash equal to the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of
the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be
made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has
been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on
the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All cash paid upon
the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Article
II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time
occurs, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the close of
business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any
other reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II.

(d) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall
be liable to any person in respect of any cash which would otherwise have
been payable in respect of any Certificate that is properly delivered to a
public official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to
two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date
on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration in respect
thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

(e) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a
bond in such amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay the Merger Consideration in respect
of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate.



 

5 (f) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent.

ARTICLE III

_Representations and Warranties_

SECTION 3.01. _Representations and Warranties of the Company._ Except as set
forth in the letter (with specific reference to the Section of this Agreement
to which the information stated in such disclosure relates; _provided_
that disclosure contained in any section of the Company Disclosure Letter
shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other Section of this
Agreement to the extent that it is readily apparent from the face of such
disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other Section of this
Agreement) delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), the Company represents and
warrants to Parent and Sub as follows: 

(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power._ Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (i) is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization (except, in the case of good standing, for entities organized
under the Laws of any jurisdiction that does not recognize such concept),
(ii) has all requisite corporate or company power and authority to carry on
its business as now being conducted and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction (except, in the case
of good standing, any jurisdiction that does not recognize such concept) in
which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than where
the failure to be so organized, existing, qualified or licensed or in good
standing (except, in the case of clause (i) above, with respect to the
Company), individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect. The



 

6 Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the
Company Certificate and the Bylaws of the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ ")
and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational
documents) of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended to the date of
this Agreement. The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct
copies of the minutes (or, in the case of draft minutes, the most recent
drafts thereof) of all meetings of the stockholders, the Board of Directors
and each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries held since January 1, 2004.

Agreement as " _Specified Contracts_ ". The Company has made available to
Parent a complete and correct copy of each of the Specified Contracts,
including all amendments thereto. Each Contract of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries (a "
_Material Contract_ "), is in full force and effect (except for those
Contracts that have expired in accordance with their terms) and is a legal,
valid and binding agreement of the Company or its Subsidiary, as the case may
be, and, to the knowledge of the Company, of each other party thereto,
enforceable against the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and,
to the knowledge of the Company, against the other party or parties thereto,
in each case, in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability
thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws relating to the enforcement
of creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity. Each of

material respect or default thereunder, and has not waived or failed to
enforce any material rights or benefits thereunder, and, to the knowledge of
the Company, no other party to any of the Material Contracts is (with or
without notice or lapse of time or both) in breach in any material respect or
default thereunder. To the knowledge of the Company, there has occurred no
event giving (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) to others any
right of termination, material amendment or cancelation of any Material
Contract. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no circumstances that are
reasonably likely to occur that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to perform its material
obligations under any Material Contract.



 

22 (ii) As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Major Customers or Major
Suppliers has terminated, failed to renew or requested any material amendment
to any of its Major Customer Contracts or Major Supplier Contracts, or any of
its existing relationships, with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(j) _Compliance with Laws._ The Company and its Subsidiaries have in effect
all material Permits that are necessary for them to own, lease or operate
their properties and assets and to carry on their businesses in all material
respects as currently conducted and as proposed to be conducted. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is, and since January 1, 2003 has been,
in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws and
Judgments, and no condition or state of facts exists that is reasonably likely
to give rise to a material violation of, or a material liability or default
under, any such applicable Law or Judgment. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company does not, and the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the terms
hereof could not reasonably be expected to cause the revocation or
cancelation of any material Permit. As of the date hereof, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written communication during the
past three years from any person that alleges that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is not in compliance in all material respects with, or is subject
to material liability under, any material Permit, Law or Judgment or relating
to the revocation or modification of any material Permit. As of the date
hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any

such investigation or review is contemplated.

to be maintained or contributed to by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any other person that, together with the Company, is treated as a



 

23 single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or with
respect to which the Company is otherwise jointly or severally liable under

providing compensation or benefits to any Company Personnel, but not including
the Benefit Agreements (all such plans, programs, arrangements and
agreements, collectively, " _Benefit Plans_ "), or (B) has made any change in

respect to any Pension Plan, or any change in the manner in which

activity, or had any actual or threatened employee strikes, work stoppages,

employment by the Company or such Subsidiary. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is, and since January 1, 2003, has been, in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable Laws and Judgments relating to
employment and employment practices, occupational safety and health standards,
terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours, and is not, and since

generators or known or suspected asbestos-containing materials for which the
Company or its Subsidiaries is responsible at, on, under or about property

and (viii) there are no past or present events, conditions, circumstances,

25 (m) _ERISA Compliance._ (i) Section 3.01(m)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and correct list of all Benefit Plans
that are "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(2) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_
")) (each, a " _Pension Plan_ "), all Benefit Plans and Benefit Agreements
that provide for stock-based, severance, change in control, termination or
similar compensation or benefits or that are maintained primarily for
directors or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and all other
material Benefit Plans and material Benefit Agreements (other than agreements
evidencing the Equity Awards) that, in each case, are in effect as of the date
of this Agreement. The Company has made available to Parent complete and
correct copies of (A) each Benefit Plan and each Benefit Agreement (or, in the
case of any unwritten Benefit Plans or Benefit Agreements, descriptions
thereof), (B) the two most recent annual reports, or such similar reports,
statements, information returns or material correspondence required to be
filed with or delivered to any Governmental Entity, if any, with respect to
each Benefit Plan, (including reports filed on Form 5500), (C) the most
recent summary plan description (if any), and any summary of material
modifications thereto, prepared for each Benefit Plan for which such summary
plan description is required under applicable Law and (D) each trust
agreement and group annuity or insurance Contract and any other Contract
relating to the funding or payment of compensation or benefits under any
Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement. Each Benefit Plan has been administered in
all material respects in accordance with its terms. The Company and its
Subsidiaries (with respect to the Benefit Plans) and all the Benefit Plans are
in compliance in all material respects with applicable Law, including ERISA
and the Code.

(ii) All Pension Plans intended to be Tax qualified under the Code have been
the subject of favorable determination letters from the Internal Revenue
Service (the " _IRS_ ") to the effect that such Pension Plans are qualified
and exempt from United States Federal income Taxes under Sections 401(a) and
501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no such determination letter has been
revoked (nor, as of the date of this Agreement, has revocation been
threatened) and no event has occurred since the date of the most recent
determination letter or application therefor relating to any such Pension Plan
that is reasonably likely to adversely affect the qualification of such
Pension Plan or require security under Section 307 of ERISA. All Pension Plans
required to have been approved by any non-United States Governmental Entity
(or permitted to have been approved to obtain any beneficial Tax or other
status) have been so approved or timely submitted for approval, no such
approval has been revoked (nor, as of the date of this Agreement, has
revocation been threatened) and no event has occurred since the date of the
most recent approval or application therefor relating to any such Pension Plan
that is reasonably likely to adversely affect any such approval relating
thereto. The Company has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy
of the most recent determination or approval letter received with respect to
each Pension Plan, as well as a complete and correct copy of each pending
application for a determination or approval letter, if any.



 

26 (iii) Neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has sponsored,
maintained, contributed to or been obligated to maintain or contribute to, or
has any actual or contingent liability under, any Benefit Plan that is subject
to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or is otherwise
a defined benefit pension plan or that provides for the payment of
termination indemnities.

(iv) No Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement that provides welfare benefits
(each, a " _Welfare Plan_ ") is funded through a "welfare benefits fund" (as
such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the Code). There are no agreements,
written or oral, and there have been no communications to Company Personnel,
that would prevent any Welfare Plan (including any Welfare Plan covering
retirees or other former employees) from being amended or terminated without
material liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or at any
time after the Effective Time. No Welfare Plan provides benefits after
termination of employment, except where the cost thereof is borne entirely by
the former employee (or his or her eligible dependents or beneficiaries) or
as required by Section 4980B(f) of the Code, ERISA or other applicable Law.

(v) Except as expressly set forth in the Offer Letters or in Section 5.04,
(A) no Company Personnel will be entitled to any severance, change in control,
termination, bonus or other additional compensation or benefits or any
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any compensation or
benefits as a result of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event) or any
compensation or benefits related to or contingent upon, or the value of which
will be calculated on the basis of, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event)
and (B) the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in
combination with any other event) and compliance by the Company with the
provisions of this Agreement do not and will not (1) trigger any funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of, or increase the cost of, or give
rise to any other obligation under, any Benefit Plan, Benefit Agreement or any
other employment arrangement, (2) trigger the forgiveness of indebtedness owed
by any Company Personnel to the Company or any of its affiliates or (3)
result in any violation or breach of, or a default (with or without notice or
lapse of time or both) under, or limit to the Companys ability to amend,
modify or terminate, any Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement.



 

27 (vi) No deduction of any amount payable pursuant to the terms of the Benefit
Plans, Benefit Agreements or any other employment arrangements is reasonably
likely to be disallowed under Section 162(m) of the Code.

(vii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of,
and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no, pending investigations by
any Governmental Entity with respect to, or pending termination proceedings or
other material claims (except claims for benefits payable in the normal
operation of the Benefit Plans and Benefit Agreements), suits or proceedings
against or involving or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under, any
Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement.

(viii) All material contributions, premiums and benefit payments under or in
connection with the Benefit Plans or Benefit Agreements that are required to
have been made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been timely
made. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred, or is
reasonably likely to incur, any unfunded liabilities in relation to any
Benefit Plan that have not been properly accounted for under GAAP.

(ix) With respect to each Benefit Plan, (A) there has not occurred any
prohibited transaction in which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective officers, directors or employees or, to the knowledge of the
Company, any trustee or other fiduciary or administrator of any Benefit Plan
or trust created thereunder, in each case, who is not an officer, director or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (a " _Non-Affiliate Plan
Fiduciary_ "), has engaged that is reasonably likely to subject the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to any material Tax on prohibited transactions
imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or any material liability imposed on
transactions prohibited under Section 406 of ERISA or any other applicable
Law or any material indemnification obligation relating to the imposition of
any such Tax or liability on any other person and (B) none of the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors
or employees, or, to the knowledge of the Company, any Non-Affiliate Plan
Fiduciary, nor any agent of any of the foregoing, has engaged in any
transaction or acted in a manner, or failed to act in a manner, that is
reasonably likely to subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
material liability for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA or any other
applicable Law or any material indemnification obligation relating to the
imposition of any such liability on any other person. 

(x) The Company and its Subsidiaries do not have any material liability or
obligations, including under or on account of a Benefit Plan or Benefit
Agreement, arising out of the hiring of persons to provide services to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and treating such persons as consultants or
independent contractors and not as employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.



 

28 (n) _Taxes._ (i) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has timely filed
all material Tax Returns required to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns
are complete and correct in all material respects. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has timely paid all material Taxes due and owing, other than
Taxes being contested in good faith and for which adequate reserves, in
accordance with GAAP, have been established. The most recent financial
statements contained in the Filed SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve,
in accordance with GAAP, for all material Taxes payable by the Company and
its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date
of such financial statements.

(ii) No material Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
currently under audit or examination by any taxing authority, and no written
notice of such an audit or examination has been received by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. There is no material deficiency, refund litigation,
proposed adjustment or matter in controversy with respect to any Taxes due and
owing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Each deficiency resulting
from any completed audit or examination or concluded litigation relating to
Taxes by any taxing authority has been timely paid. No material issues
(individually or in the aggregate) relating to Taxes were raised in writing by
the relevant taxing authority during any presently pending audit or
examination, and no material issues (individually or in the aggregate)
relating to Taxes were raised in writing by the relevant taxing authority in
any completed audit or examination that could reasonably be expected to recur
in a later taxable period. The relevant statute of limitations is closed with
respect to the U.S. federal income Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all years through December 31, 2002. 

(iii) There is no currently effective agreement or other document extending
the period of assessment or collection of any material Taxes (other than
extensions to file Tax Returns), and no power of attorney (other than powers
of attorney authorizing employees of the Company to act on behalf of the
Company) with respect to any material Taxes has been executed or filed with
any taxing authority.

(iv) No material Liens for Taxes exist with respect to any assets or
properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for Liens
imposed by applicable Laws for Taxes not yet due and Liens for Taxes that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is contesting in good faith through
appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves, in accordance with
GAAP, have been established.



 

29 (v) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, bound by or
currently has any liability under any Tax sharing agreement, Tax indemnity
obligation or similar agreement, arrangement or practice with respect to
material Taxes (including the Taxes of any other person) (including any
closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Section 7121
of the Code (but excluding any other closing agreements with any other taxing
authorities) and any advance pricing agreement).

(vi) Other than payments that may be made to persons set forth on Section
3.01(n)(vii) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Primary Company
Executives_ "), no amount or other entitlement that could be received (whether
in cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result of the Merger
(alone or in combination with any other event) by any person who is a
"disqualified individual" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1)

48 SECTION 4.02. _No Solicitation._ (a) Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of
its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any investment banker,
attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative of the Company or any

or representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries not to), (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action knowingly
to facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal or
(ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person (or any representative
thereof) any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way
with any person (or any representative thereof) with respect to, any Takeover
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that at any time prior to obtaining the
Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in response
to a bona fide written unsolicited Takeover Proposal that such Board of
Directors determines in good faith constitutes or could reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Proposal, and which Takeover Proposal did not result
from a breach of this Section 4.02 or Section 4.01(a)(viii)(C), and subject to
compliance with Section 4.02(c), (A) furnish or cause its Subsidiaries to
furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
person making such Takeover Proposal (and its representatives) pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement which contains terms that are no less restrictive
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement dated May 25, 2006
between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ that all such information had been
or is provided on a prior or concurrent basis to Parent and (B) participate
in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Takeover Proposal
(and its representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any investment banker,
attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 4.02(a) by
the Company.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any person (other than Parent or Sub) relating
to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any direct or indirect
acquisition, in one transaction or a series of transactions, including by way
of any merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, stock acquisition,
asset acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, license agreement
or similar transaction, of (i) assets or businesses that constitute or
represent 15% or more of the total revenue, net income, EBITDA or assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) 15% or more of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or of any class of capital
stock of, or other equity or voting interests in,



 

49 one or more of the Companys Subsidiaries which, in the aggregate, directly or
indirectly hold the assets or businesses referred to in clause (i) above, in
each case other than the Merger.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any
binding bona fide unsolicited written offer which did not result from a breach
of Section 4.02(a) made by a third party which, if consummated, would result
in such third party (or in the case of a direct merger between such third
party and the Company, the stockholders of such third party) acquiring,
directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting power of the Company
Common Stock or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and which offer, in the good faith judgment of
the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel), (i)
provides a higher value to the stockholders of the Company than the
consideration payable in the Merger (taking into account all of the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Superior
Proposal or otherwise)), (ii) is not subject to any financing condition and
(iii) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all
financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (or shall agree or resolve to) (i) withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Sub, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the recommendation by such Board of Directors
or any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger or recommend, or
propose publicly to recommend, the approval or recommendation of any Takeover
Proposal or resolve or agree to take any such action (any such action or any
such resolution or agreement to take such action being referred to herein as
an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (ii) approve or recommend any
Takeover Proposal, or propose the approval or recommendation of any Takeover
Proposal or resolve or agree to take any such action or (iii) cause or permit
the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement
(each, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting or related to, or which
is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Takeover Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 4.02(a)) or
resolve or agree to take any such action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at
any time prior to the Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the
Company may, in response to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event,
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change,  _provided_ that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, that the failure to do so is reasonably likely to result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law, and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Board of Directors of
the Company may not effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change unless (i)
the Board of Directors



 

50 shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent (an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change Notice_ ") that it is prepared to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening
Event, which notice shall, in the case of a Superior Proposal, attach the most
current version of any written agreement relating to the transaction that
constitutes such Superior Proposal, and, in the case of an Intervening Event,
attach information describing such Intervening Event in reasonable detail, and
(ii) Parent does not make, within five business days after the receipt of
such notice, a proposal that would, in the reasonable good faith judgment of
the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with a financial
advisor of national reputation and outside legal counsel), (A) cause the
offer previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal or (B) obviate the need for an Adverse Recommendation Change
as a result of an Intervening Event. The Company agrees that, during the five
business day period prior to its effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change,
the Company and its officers, directors and representatives shall negotiate in
good faith with Parent and its officers, directors, and representatives
regarding any revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement proposed by Parent.

For purposes of this Agreement the term " _Intervening Event_ " means an
event, unknown to the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date hereof
(or, if known, the material consequences of which are not known to or
understood by the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date
hereof), which event (or any material consequence of which) becomes known to
or by (or understood by) the Board of Directors of the Company prior to the
Stockholder Approval and which causes the Board of Directors of the Company to
conclude in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that its failure to
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change is reasonably likely to result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the receipt,
existence or terms of a Takeover Proposal or any matter relating thereto or
consequence thereof constitute an Intervening Event. 

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall as promptly as possible, and
in any event within 24 hours after the Company first obtains knowledge of the
receipt thereof, advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) any Takeover
Proposal or any request for information that the Company reasonably believes
could lead to or contemplates a Takeover Proposal or (ii) any inquiry the
Company reasonably believes could lead to any Takeover Proposal, the terms and
conditions of such Takeover Proposal request or inquiry (including any
subsequent amendment or other modification to such terms and conditions) and
the identity of the person making any such Takeover Proposal request or
inquiry. On a daily basis at mutually reasonably agreeable times, the Company
(or its outside counsel) shall (i) advise and confer with Parent (or its
outside counsel) regarding the progress of negotiations concerning any
Takeover Proposal, the material resolved and unresolved issues related thereto
and the material terms (including material amendments



 

51 or proposed amendments as to price and other material terms) of any such
Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry and (ii) promptly upon receipt or
delivery thereof, provide Parent with copies of all documents and written
communications relating to such Takeover Proposal exchanged between the
Company or any of its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives, on the one hand,
and the party making a Takeover Proposal or any of its officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors
or representatives, on the other hand.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if,
in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, failure
so to disclose would be inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors or
any committee thereof take, agree or resolve to take any action prohibited by
Section 4.02(b).

SECTION 4.03. _Conduct by Parent._ During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, except as consented to in writing by the
Company prior to such action or as specifically contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
take any action that is reasonably likely to result in (a) any representation
and warranty of Parent or Sub set forth in this Agreement that is qualified as
to materiality becoming untrue (as so qualified) or (b) any such
representation and warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue in any
material respect.

the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting,
or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no
covenant is made by the Company with respect to statements made in the Proxy
Statement based on information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent
for inclusion or incorporation for reference therein. Parent agrees that none
of such information will (except to the extent revised or superseded by
amendments or supplements contemplated hereby), at the date the Proxy
Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to the stockholders of the Company
or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, or at the time of any amendment or

Agreement, establish a record date (which will be as promptly as reasonably
practicable

absent any Legal Restraint that has the effect of preventing such action,
cause to occur on the 20th business day following the date of mailing of the
Proxy Statement (the " _Stockholders Meeting_ "), for the purpose of
obtaining the Stockholder Approval, regardless of whether the Board of
Directors of the Company determines at any time that this Agreement is no
longer advisable or recommends that the stockholders of the Company reject it
or any other Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred at any time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if the Company is unable to obtain a quorum
of its stockholders at such time, the Company may extend the date of the
Stockholders Meeting by no more than five business days and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts during such five-business day period to obtain
such a quorum as soon as practicable, (ii) the Company may delay the
Stockholders Meeting to the extent (and only to the extent) the Company
reasonably determines that such delay is required by applicable Law to comply
with comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and (iii) if
the Board of Directors of the Company shall have delivered an Adverse
Recommendation Change Notice to Parent, the Company may delay the Stockholders
Meeting until one day after the expiration of the five-business day period
immediately following delivery of such notice. The notice of such
Stockholders Meeting shall state that a resolution to adopt this Agreement
will be considered at the Stockholders Meeting. Subject to Section 4.02(b)(i),
the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend to holders of
the Company Common Stock that they adopt this Agreement, and shall include
such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to this
Section 5.01(c) shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal,
public disclosure or communication to the Company or any other person of any
Takeover Proposal.

SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ (a) Subject to
applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, afford to Parent and to Parents officers, employees, investment bankers,

LLP). Subject to applicable Law, following the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Effective Time, Parent may (but shall not be required to),
following reasonable notice to the Company, contact and interview any Company
Personnel. No investigation by Parent or any of its officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or
representatives and no other receipt of information by Parent or any of its
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or
other advisors or representatives shall operate as a waiver or otherwise
affect any representation or



 

54 warranty of the Company or any covenant or other provision in this Agreement.
Except as required by any applicable Law or Judgment, Parent will hold, and
will direct its officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors and representatives to hold, any and all
information received from the Company confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the period from
the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, as and to the extent requested by

independent determination that the Company and its Subsidiaries have complied
with FCC rules regarding changes of ownership control of the FCC
Licenses (including descriptions of any transactions that effected a change
of ownership or control of the FCC Licenses (including any intracompany
reorganizations) and corporate organizational charts depicting the ownership
structure of the holder of the FCC Licenses before and after any such change
of ownership or control).

SECTION 5.03. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Consultation and Notice._ (a) Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using its reasonable best efforts to
accomplish the following: (i) the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set
forth in Article VI, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from, and
the giving of any necessary notices to, Governmental Entities and other
persons and the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and

declarations and filings with, or notices to, Governmental Entities, if any)

information requested by a Governmental Entity, including participating in
meetings with officials of such entity in the course of its review of this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iv) the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to
avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any Governmental

shall not limit the rights of the Company or its Board of Directors under
Section 4.02(b). In connection with and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of the Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or



 

55 becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts
to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall
Parent or Sub be obligated to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not
without the prior written consent of Parent, agree or proffer to divest or
hold separate, or enter into any licensing or similar arrangement with respect
to, any assets (whether tangible or intangible) or any portion of any
business of Parent, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries be obligated to
litigate or participate in the litigation of any suit, claim, action,
investigation or proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, brought by
any Governmental Entity (i) challenging or seeking to restrain or prohibit the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or seeking to obtain from Parent or any of its Subsidiaries any
damages in relation therewith; (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit in any
respect, or place any conditions on, the ownership or operation by the
Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates of all or any portion of
the business or assets or any product of the Company or its Subsidiaries or

license (whether pursuant to an exclusive or nonexclusive license) or hold
separate all or any portion of the business or assets or any product of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or Parent or its Subsidiaries, in each case as a
result of or in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) seeking to directly or indirectly impose
limitations on the ability of Parent or any of its affiliates to acquire or
hold, or exercise full rights of ownership of, any shares of Company Common
Stock or any shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, including
the right to vote the Company Common Stock or the shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation on all matters properly presented to the
stockholders of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, respectively; or
(iv) seeking to (A) directly or indirectly prohibit Parent or any of its
affiliates from effectively controlling in any respect any of the business or
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (B) directly or indirectly
prevent the Company or its Subsidiaries from operating any of their business
in substantially the same manner as operated by the Company and
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company
and Parent shall provide such assistance, information and cooperation to each
other as is reasonably required to obtain any such actions, nonactions,
waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations and, in connection
therewith, shall notify the other person promptly following the receipt of any
comments from any Governmental Entity and of any request by any Governmental
Entity for amendments, supplements or additional information in respect of
any registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to, such Governmental
Entity, shall supply the other person with copies of all correspondence
between such person or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Entity, on the other hand.



 

56 (b) (i) In connection with the continuing operation of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, subject to applicable Law, the Company shall consult in good
faith on a reasonably regular basis with Parent to report material
(individually or in the aggregate) operational developments, the general
status of relationships with customers and resellers, the general status of
ongoing operations and other matters reasonably requested by Parent pursuant
to procedures reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
no such consultation shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. 

(ii) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, the Company shall promptly notify
Parent in writing of:

(A) the occurrence of any matter or event that (1) is, or that is reasonably
likely to be, material (individually or in the aggregate) to the business,
assets, properties, condition (financial or otherwise), or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (2) is
reasonably likely to result in (I) any representation and warranty of the
Company set forth in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality
becoming untrue, (II) any such representation and warranty that is not so
qualified becoming untrue in any material respect or (III) any condition to
the transactions contemplated hereby and set forth in Section 6.02 not being
satisfied;

(B) the failure of the Company to perform in any material respect any
obligation to be performed by it under this Agreement;

(C) any material notice or material communication from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger, and a copy of any such notice or
communication shall be furnished to Parent together with the Companys written
notice;

(D) any notice or other communication from any Major Customer or Major
Supplier to the effect that such Major Customer or Major Supplier is
terminating or otherwise materially adversely modifying its relationship with
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the transactions

(E) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to
its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if pending on the date
of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
Section 3.01(h), or that relate to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;



 

57 _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the
parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

(iii) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of (A) any representation
or warranty made by it or Sub contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or
inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section 6.03(a) would not be
satisfied or (B) the failure of it or Sub to perform in any material respect
any obligation to be performed by such party under this Agreement such that
the condition set forth in Section 6.03(b) would not be satisfied; _provided_
, _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the parties (or remedies
with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of any litigation
against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and will obtain the prior written consent of
Parent prior to settling or satisfying any such claim (which consent shall,
solely in the case of any Material Litigation that has resulted in any
condition set forth in Section 6.02(c) not being satisfied, not be
unreasonably withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that no litigation shall
be considered Material Litigation for purposes of this Section 5.03 if Parent
shall have waived any condition to closing to the extent such condition is not
satisfied as a result of such litigation as of the date that all other
conditions to closing shall have been satisfied or waived by Parent);
_provided_ that nothing in this Section 5.03(c) shall obligate Parent to agree
or consent to the Company or any Subsidiary divesting, holding separate, or
entering into any licensing or similar arrangement with respect to, any
assets (whether tangible or intangible); and _provided_ further that it is
understood and agreed that this Section 5.03(c) shall not give Parent the
right to direct such defense.

SECTION 5.04. _Equity Awards._ (a) As soon as practicable following the date
of this Agreement, the Company agrees that the Board of Directors of the
Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock
Plans or the Purchase Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions (including obtaining any required consents) as may be required to
effect the following:

(i) subject to the terms of any Offer Letters with the holders of Stock
Options, (A) not less than 15 days prior to the Effective Time, each
outstanding Stock Option shall automatically accelerate so that each such
Stock Option shall become fully exercisable for all shares of Company Common
Stock at the time subject to such Stock Option and may be exercised by the
holder thereof for any



 

58 or all of such shares and (B) upon the Effective Time, all outstanding Stock
Options shall be canceled, with the holder of each Stock Option becoming
entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with
respect thereto, an amount in cash equal to (x) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Stock Option, multiplied by (y) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Stock Option; _provided_ that all amounts
payable pursuant to this clause (i) shall be subject to any required
withholding of Taxes or proof of eligibility for exemption therefrom and shall
be paid at or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, without
interest;

(ii) subject to the terms of any Offer Letters with the holders of Restricted
Shares, each Restricted Share outstanding at the Effective Time shall be
adjusted as necessary to provide that the restrictions on such share shall

shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with Section 2.01(c), subject to any applicable withholding
pursuant to Section 2.02(f);

Performance RSU that has vested in full shall be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.01(c), subject
to any applicable withholding pursuant to Section 2.02(f); and

(v) subject to Sections 5.04(a)(i), (a)(ii), (a)(iii) and (a)(iv), each
provision in each Benefit Plan and Benefit Agreement providing for the
issuance, transfer or grant of any shares of Company Common Stock or any
Stock Options, Restricted Shares, Performance RSUs or any other interests in
respect of any capital stock (including any "phantom" stock or stock
appreciation rights) of the Company shall be deleted prior to the Effective
Time, and the Company shall ensure, that following the Effective Time, there
shall be no rights to acquire shares of Company Common Stock, Stock Options,
Restricted Shares, Performance RSUs or any other interests in respect of any
capital stock (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) of
the Company or the Surviving Corporation.



 

59 (b) The Company shall take any actions with respect to the Purchase Plans as
are necessary to provide that (i) participation in the Purchase Plans shall
be limited to those employees who were participants on the date of this
Agreement, (ii) such participants may not increase their payroll deduction
elections or purchase elections from those in effect on the date of this
Agreement, (iii) each purchase right under the Purchase Plans outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time shall be automatically exercised by
applying the payroll deductions of each then current participant in the
Purchase Plans for the then current purchase period in effect under the
Purchase Plans (each, a "Purchase Period") to the purchase of whole shares of
Company Common Stock (subject to the provisions of the Purchase
Plans regarding the maximum number and value of shares purchasable per
participant) at a purchase price per share equal to 85% of the lower of (A)
the fair market value per share of Company Common Stock on the start date of
the Purchase Period in which the Merger occurs and (B) the fair market value
per share of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(iv) there shall not be any additional Purchase Periods commencing following
the date of this Agreement under the Purchase Plans and (v) the Purchase
Plans shall terminate, effective upon the earlier of the first purchase date
following the date of this Agreement and the last business day before the
Effective Time, but subsequent to the exercise of purchase rights pursuant to
clause (iii) above.

SECTION 5.05. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance._ (a) Parent
and Sub agree that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective
certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) and any indemnification or other agreements of the Company as in
effect on the date of this Agreement shall be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time, and
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to comply with and honor the foregoing obligations.

(b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and
assets to any person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation then,
and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.05.

(c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect
directors and officers liability insurance covering each person currently
covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy
for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time on terms that are
no less favorable than those of



 

60 such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement, which insurance shall,
prior to the Closing, be in effect and prepaid for such six year period;
_provided_ , that in no event shall Parent be required to pay, with respect to
the entire six year period following the Effective Time, premiums for
insurance under this Section 5.05(c) which in the aggregate exceed 300% of
the aggregate premiums paid by the Company for the period from August 15, 2005
to, and including, August 15, 2006, for such purpose (which premiums for such
period are hereby represented and warranted by the Company to be $1,114,750);
_provided_ that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such
coverage, with respect to the entire six year period following the Effective
Time, as may be obtained for such 300% amount. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this Section 5.05(c) shall require Parent to make expenditures
exceeding $3,344,250 in the aggregate.

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.05 (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such person may have by contract or otherwise.

SECTION 5.06. _Fees and Expenses._ (a) Except as expressly set forth in this
Section 5.06, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

(b) In the event that (i) a Takeover Proposal has been publicly proposed or
any person has publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional
and whether or not withdrawn) to make a Takeover Proposal or a Takeover
Proposal otherwise becomes generally known to the stockholders of the Company
and thereafter (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) or Section 7.01(b)(iii) and (B) prior
to the date that is 12 months after such termination, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries enters into any Acquisition Agreement with respect to any
Takeover Proposal or any Takeover Proposal is consummated (solely for purposes
of this Section 5.06(b)(i)(B), the term " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall have the
meaning set forth in the definition of Takeover Proposal contained in Section
4.02(a) except that all references to 15% shall be deemed references to 40%)
or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c),
then, in each such case, the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to
$40,250,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of same-day funds to
an account designated by Parent (A) in the case of a termination by Parent
pursuant to Section 7.01(c), within two business days after such termination
and (B) in the case of a payment as a result of any event referred to in
Section 5.06(b)(i)(B), no later than the first to occur of such events.

(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
5.06 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement.



 

61 Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amounts due pursuant to
this Section 5.06 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a
suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the amounts set forth
in this Section 5.06, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit and any appeal relating thereto, together with interest on the amounts
set forth in this Section 5.06 at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect
on the date such payment was required to be made. 

SECTION 5.07. _Public Announcements._ The parties agree that the initial press
release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties. Parent and
Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent
at all reasonably practicable, consult with each other before making, and
give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such reasonably
practicable consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system.

SECTION 5.08. _Sub Compliance._ Parent shall cause Sub to comply with all of
Subs obligations under this Agreement.

SECTION 5.09. _Company Rights Agreement._ The Board of Directors of the
Company shall take all further actions (in addition to those referred to in
Section 3.01(s)) reasonably requested by Parent in order to render the Company
Rights inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger, the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the terms of this
Agreement. Except as provided above with respect to this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, amend, modify, take any action with respect to, or make any
determination under, the Company Rights Agreement.

construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of Laws thereof.

SECTION 8.08. _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of

upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns.

SECTION 8.09. _Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Venue._ Each of
the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive

Chancery shall be unavailable, any Delaware State court and the Federal court
of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware) for the
purposes of any suit, action or other



 

70 proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated
hereby (and agrees that no such action, suit or proceeding relating to this
Agreement shall be brought by it or any of its Subsidiaries except in such
courts). Each of the parties further agrees that, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, service of any process, summons, notice
or document by U.S. registered mail to such persons respective address set
forth above shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or
proceeding in the State of Delaware with respect to any matters to which it
has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding
sentence. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives
(and agrees not to plead or claim), any objection to the laying of venue of
any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the
Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, in any Delaware State court
or the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of
Delaware) or that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

SECTION 8.10. _Waiver of Jury Trial._ Each party hereto hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding directly or
indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement. Each
party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would
not, in the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto
have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the
mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 8.10.

SECTION 8.11. _Enforcement._ The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the
Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be
unavailable, in any Delaware State court or the Federal court of the United
States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

SECTION 8.12. _Consents and Approvals._ For any matter under this Agreement
requiring the consent or approval of any party to be valid and binding on the
parties hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing.

SECTION 8.13. _Severability._ If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision hereof.



 

71 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Sub and the Company have caused this Agreement to
be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized, all as of
the date first written above.
