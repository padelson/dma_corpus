Section 3.2 _Determination of Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) Promptly after the Closing Date, and in any event not later than sixty
(60) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to
Casella (i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of FCR as of 11:59 P.M. on
the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date prepared in accordance
with GAAP and in a manner consistent with the policies and principles used by
Sellers in connection with the preparation of the Financial Statements (the "
_Closing Balance Sheet_ "), and (ii) a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth Purchasers good faith calculations (" _Purchaser s Proposed
Calculations_") of (A) the amount of FCR Indebtedness, (B) the FCR Transaction
Expenses, (C) the Closing Working Capital, (D) the amount of the Working
Capital Adjustment, if any, (E) the FCR Capital Expenditures and (F) a
calculation of the Final Purchase Price based on the amounts set forth in the
Closing Statement. Upon delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet and Purchasers
Proposed Calculations by Purchaser, Purchaser shall provide Casella and its
Representatives with reasonable access, during normal business hours, to FCRs
accounting and other personnel and to the books and records of FCR, as the
case may be, and any other document or information reasonably requested by
Casella, and necessary to allow Casella and its Representatives to verify the
accuracy of Purchasers Proposed Calculations.

 



 

(b) In the event that Casella does not object to the Closing Balance Sheet or
Purchasers Proposed Calculations by written notice of objection (the "
_Notice of Objection_ ") delivered to Purchaser within thirty (30) days after
Casellas receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and Purchasers Proposed
Calculations, the recalculation of the Initial Purchase Price pursuant to
Purchasers Proposed Calculations shall be deemed final and binding. A Notice
of Objection

 



      
 

 



 

under this _Section 3.2(b)_ shall set forth in reasonable detail Casellas
alternative calculations of (i) FCR Indebtedness, (ii) the FCR Transaction
Expenses, (iii) the Closing Working Capital, (iv) the Working Capital
Adjustment, (v) the FCR Capital Expenditures and (vi) a recalculation of the
Final Purchase Price based on such amounts.

 



 

(c) If Casella delivers a Notice of Objection to Purchaser within the thirty
(30) day period referred to in _Section 3.2(b)_ , then any element of
Purchasers Proposed Calculations that is not in dispute on the date such
Notice of Objection is given shall be treated as final and binding and any
dispute (all such amounts, the " _Disputed Amounts_ ") shall be resolved as
set forth in this _Section 3.2(c)_ :

 



 

(i) Casella and Purchaser shall promptly endeavor in good faith to resolve the
Disputed Amounts listed in the Notice of Objection. If a written agreement
determining the Disputed Amounts has not been reached within ten (10) Business
Days (or such longer period as may be agreed by Casella and Purchaser) after
the date of receipt by Purchaser from Casella of the Notice of Objection, the
resolution of such Disputed Amounts shall be submitted to Ernst and Young or
another firm mutually agreed by Casella and Purchaser (the " _Arbitrator_ ").

 



 

(ii) Casella and Purchaser shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Arbitrator to render a decision in accordance with this _Section
3.2(c)_ along with a statement of reasons therefor within thirty (30) days of
the submission of the Disputed Amounts, or a reasonable time thereafter, to
the Arbitrator. The decision of the Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon
each Party and the decision of the Arbitrator shall constitute an arbitral
award that is final, binding and non-appealable and upon which a judgment may
be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereover.

 



 

(iii) The Final Purchase Price shall be recalculated based upon the final
determination (or deemed determination) of the Arbitrator with respect to the
Disputed Amounts and the Final Purchase Price, as so recalculated, shall be
deemed to be final and binding.

 



 

(iv) If Casella and Purchaser submit any Disputed Amounts to the Arbitrator
for resolution, Casella and Purchaser shall each pay their own costs and
expenses incurred under this _Section 3.2(c)_. Casella shall be responsible
for that fraction of the fees and costs of the Arbitrator (expressed as a
percentage) equal to the quotient of (A) the absolute value of the difference
between Casellas aggregate position with respect to the Final Purchase Price
and the Final Purchase Price as recalculated based upon Arbitrators final
determination with respect to the Disputed Amounts, _divided by_ (B) the
absolute value of the difference between Casellas aggregate position with
respect to the Final Purchase Price and Purchasers aggregate position with
respect to the Final Purchase Price, and Purchaser shall be responsible for
the remainder of such fees and costs, if any.

 



 

(v) The Arbitrator shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based upon the
provisions of this _Section 3.2(c)_ , only the Disputed Amounts and the
determination of each amount of the Disputed Amounts shall be made in
accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 3.2(a)_. The Parties
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Arbitrators
determination of the Disputed Amounts to be no less than the lesser of the
amount claimed by either Casella or Purchaser, and shall be no greater than
the greater of the amount

 



      
 

 



 

claimed by either Casella or Purchaser; _provided_ , that, if, notwithstanding
the commercially reasonable efforts of Casella and Purchaser, (A) the
Arbitrators determination of any Disputed Amount is less than the lesser of
the amounts claimed by either Casella or Purchaser, then such disputed amount
shall be deemed to be the lesser of the amounts claimed by either Casella or
Purchaser or (B) the Arbitrators determination of any Disputed Amount is more
than the greater of the amounts claimed by either Casella or Purchaser, then
such disputed amount shall be deemed to be the greater of the amounts claimed
by either Casella or Purchaser.

 



 

(d) Upon the determination, in accordance with _Section 3.2(b)_ or _Section
3.2(c)_ , of the Final Purchase Price, Casella or Purchaser, as the case may
be, shall make the payment required by this _Section 3.2(d)_. The amount
payable by Casella or Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 3.2(d)_ is referred
to herein as the " _Purchase Price Adjustment_ " and shall be treated as an
adjustment to the purchase price for federal, state, local and foreign income
Tax purposes.

 



 

(i) If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Initial Purchase Price,
then Purchaser shall pay to Casella for the account of Sellers the difference
between the Final Purchase Price and the Initial Purchase Price within three
(3) Business Days of the determination of the Final Purchase Price, such
Purchase Price Adjustment to be paid by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by Casella in writing to Purchaser promptly
after the final determination of the Final Purchase Price.

 



 

(ii) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Initial Purchase Price, then
within three (3) Business Days after the determination of the Final Purchase
Price, Casella shall pay or cause to be paid to Purchaser such difference by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Purchaser. Any amount to be paid by Casella pursuant to this _Section
3.2(d)(ii)_ shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated by Purchaser in writing to Casella promptly after the
final determination of the Final Purchase Price.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Closing; Closing Deliverables_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth
in _Article VII_ , hereof, the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby
(the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of White and Case LLP, 1155
Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York, 10036-2787, as soon as

Parties will target February 28, 2011 as the Closing Date; _provided_ that
this sentence shall not impose any legal obligations on the Parties or give

Section 3.4 _Limited Withholding Rights; Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this _Article III_ , such amounts
(and only such amounts) as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect

(b) The Parties shall allocate the Initial Purchase Price plus the sum of (i)
Estimated FCR Indebtedness and (ii) Estimated FCR Transaction Expenses (such
amount the " _Estimated 1060 Amount_ "), or the Final Purchase Price plus the
sum of (x) FCR Indebtedness and (y) FCR Transaction Expenses (such amount the
" _Final 1060 Amount_ "), as applicable, to be paid for the Equity Interests
in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder. Sellers and Purchaser agree to negotiate in good faith
prior to the Closing Date an allocation of the Estimated 1060 Amount among the
underlying assets of the Companies and their Subsidiaries (other than working
capital which the Parties agree will be ascribed the value determined in
computing the Initial Purchase Price) in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. In the event the
Parties reach such an agreement on the allocation of the Estimated 1060 Amount
(such allocation, the " _Estimated 1060 Allocation_ ") prior to the Closing
Date, the Parties shall allocate the Final 1060 Amount, when determined, among
the underlying assets of the Companies and their Subsidiaries (other than
working capital which the Parties agree will be ascribed the value determined
in computing the Final Purchase Price) in a manner consistent with the
Estimated

 



      
 

 



 

1060 Allocation in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder. In the event the Parties do not reach an
agreement on the Estimated 1060 Allocation prior to the Closing Date, Sellers
and Purchaser shall mutually select an independent appraisal firm (the "
_Appraiser_ ") which shall be instructed to (A) prepare a written appraisal of
such assets and an allocation of the Estimated 1060 Amount or Final 1060
Amount, as applicable (in each case, less the amount ascribed to working
capital, as mentioned above) among such assets (the " _Appraisal_ ") and (B)
deliver to the Parties a complete and final Appraisal prior to April 30, 2011.
The Parties shall be bound by the Appraisal and the allocation determined by
the Appraiser shall be final and binding on the Sellers and Purchaser;
provided, however, that in the event the Appraisal was determined based on an
allocation of the Estimated 1060 Amount, the Parties agree to allocate the
Final 1060 Amount among the underlying assets of the Companies and their
Subsidiaries (other than working capital which the Parties agree will be
ascribed the value determined in computing the Final Purchase Price) in a
manner consistent with the allocation of the Estimated 1060 Amount set forth
in the Appraisal and in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Sellers and Purchaser shall each
bear 50% of the fees and expenses of the Appraiser. In addition, the Parties
hereby undertake and agree to file timely any information that may be required
to be filed pursuant to Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 1060(b)
of the Code, and shall use the allocation of the Final 1060 Amount determined
pursuant to this Section 3.4(b) in connection with the preparation of IRS Form
8594 as such form relates to the Equity Interests. Neither Party shall file
any Tax Return or other document or otherwise take any position which is
inconsistent with the allocation of the Final 1060 Amount determined pursuant
to this Section 3.4(b), except as may be adjusted by subsequent agreement
following an audit by the IRS or by an Order; provided, that neither Party
(nor their respective Affiliates) shall be obligated to litigate any challenge
to such allocation of the Final 1060 Amount by any Governmental Entity. The
allocation of the Final 1060 Amount shall be revised to take into account
subsequent purchase price adjustments pursuant to this Agreement in the manner
provided by Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder and consistent with the preparation of the allocation of the Final
1060 Amount. The Parties shall promptly inform one another of any challenge by
any Governmental Entity to any allocation made pursuant to this Section 3.4(b)
and shall consult with and keep one another informed with respect to the state
of, and any discussion, proposal or submission with respect to, such
challenge.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Tax Treatment of Payments_. Any payment made pursuant to _Section
3.2_ , _Section 8.4_ or _Article X_ , except to the extent such payments are
required by Law to be treated as interest for tax purposes, shall be deemed to
be, and each of Sellers and Purchaser shall treat such payments as an
adjustment to the purchase price for all federal, state, local and foreign
income tax purposes.

hereof, all jurisdictions in which the property owned, leased or operated by
such Seller, or the nature of the business conducted by such Seller makes such
qualification necessary, except such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing does not and could not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect. Each Seller has made available to Purchaser prior to the date hereof
copies of its organizational documents, in each case as amended and in full
force and effect as of the date hereof.

 



 

Section 4.2 _Authorization; Noncontravention and Consents_.

all corporate and other action necessary to execute and deliver this Agreement
and all other instruments and agreements to be delivered by such Seller as

Documents_ "), to perform its respective obligations hereunder and thereunder
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The
execution, delivery and performance by such Seller of this Agreement and of
all other instruments and agreements to be delivered by such Seller as
contemplated hereby, the consummation by such Seller of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and the performance of such Sellers
obligations hereunder and thereunder have been, and in the case of documents
required to be delivered at the Closing will be, duly authorized and approved
by all necessary corporate or other action. This Agreement has been, and all
other instruments and agreements to be executed and delivered by each Seller
as contemplated hereby will be, duly executed and delivered by such Seller.
Assuming that this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
Purchaser and each other Person (other than each Seller) party hereto, this
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each Seller,
enforceable against such Seller in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting the enforcement of

contemplated hereby constitute valid and binding obligations of Purchaser and
each other Person (other than such Seller and its Subsidiaries) party thereto,
such instruments and agreements will constitute valid and binding obligations
of such Seller, enforceable against such Seller in accordance with their

insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and by general equitable
principles.

 



 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and all other instruments and
agreements to be delivered by each Seller as contemplated hereby do not, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not
(i) conflict with any of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation,
the by-laws or equivalent charter documents of such Seller or any of its
respective Subsidiaries, in each case, as amended to the date of this

benefits under, any Material Contract or other material instrument to which
such Seller, or any of its respective Subsidiaries is a party or by which any
of their respective properties or assets are bound, or (iv) subject to the
applicable requirements of the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust
Laws, contravene any Law or any Order applicable to such Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries or by which any of their respective properties or assets are
bound.

 



 

Section 4.3 _Ownership of Equity Interests_. Each Seller has good and valid
title to the Equity Interests set forth opposite its name in _Section 1.1(a)_
of the Seller Disclosure Letter free and clear of all Liens, and is the record
and beneficial owner thereof. There is no outstanding Contract with any Person
to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding equity interest in
any Company. The assignments, endorsements and other instruments of transfer
delivered by each Seller to Purchaser at the Closing will be sufficient to
transfer such Sellers entire interest, record and beneficial, in the Equity
Interests set forth opposite its name in _Section 1.1(a)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter to Purchaser.

 



 

Section 4.4 _BMR, FCR and their Subsidiaries_.

jurisdiction in which the character or location of the properties owned,
leased or operated by such Subsidiary or the nature of the business conducted
by such Subsidiary makes such qualification necessary except where the failure
to so qualify has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

directly or indirectly, any capital stock or other equity, ownership,

their respective Subsidiaries, pursuant to which any Subsidiary of a Company
is or may become obligated to issue, deliver or sell or cause to be issued,
delivered or sold, shares of capital stock of or other equity or voting
interests in, any Subsidiary of a Company or any securities convertible into,

the related statements of income or operations and cash flows fairly present,
in all material respects, the results of operations and cash flows of FCR and

than routine claims for benefits arising in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice). Except as contemplated by Section 6.13(g), the
execution of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, do not

result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), "parachute
payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G of the Code), acceleration,
vesting or increase in benefits to any present or former employee of any
Company or their Subsidiaries. Full payment has been timely made of all

respect of or on the part of such Company or its Subsidiaries or event,
occurrence, condition or act (including the purchase of the Equity Interests

under any such Real Property Lease.

 



 

(d) With respect to each Real Property Lease pursuant to which a Company or
one of its Subsidiaries is a lessee or sublessee: (i) such Company or one of

(including the purchase of the Equity Interests hereunder) in respect of or on
the part of such Company or its Subsidiaries which, with the giving of notice,
the lapse of time or the happening of any further event or condition, would
become a material default or event of default under any such Real Property
Lease, in each case except for the purchase of the Equity Interests hereunder
to the extent a landlord consent is not obtained for any Real Property Lease
set forth in _Section 4.6_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter approving such
purchase. Except for the Leased Real Property subject to the Real Property
Leases, there is no other real property leased by any Company or their
respective Subsidiaries which is used in the business of the Companies or
their respective Subsidiaries.

 



 

(e) The buildings, structures, appurtenances and improvements included within
the Real Property have not had performed on them by Casella or any of its
Subsidiaries any material alteration, repair, improvement or other work that

and its Subsidiaries that are not purchased pursuant to this Agreement) or has
any other material commercial or business relationships with the Companies or
their Affiliates (other than with Seller and its Subsidiaries that are not
purchased pursuant to this Agreement). Ownership of securities of a company
whose securities are registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, of two percent (2%) or less of any class of such securities shall not
be deemed to be a financial interest for purposes of this _Section 4.20_.

 



 

Section 4.21 _Suppliers and Customers_. _Section 4.21_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter sets forth an accurate and complete list of each supplier
and customer accounting for more than one percent (1%) of the consolidated

such supplier and customer are good commercial working relationships, and
except as set forth in _Section 4.21_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, since
the Balance Sheet Date no such supplier or customer has canceled or otherwise
terminated (other than expirations which do not require any action to be taken
or notice to be given in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Contract), or threatened in writing to cancel or otherwise terminate (other
than upon the expiration of any Contract), its relationship with the Companies
or any of their respective Subsidiaries. Since the Balance Sheet Date none of
the Companies or its Subsidiaries has received any written notice that any
such supplier or customer may cancel or otherwise adversely modify its
relationship with such Company or any of its Subsidiaries or limit its
services, supplies or materials to such Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
its usage or purchase of the services and products of such Company or its
Subsidiaries (other than in connection with renegotiations of Contracts).
Purchaser agrees that any claim under _Section 10.2(a)_ based on lost
revenues resulting from a termination of any supplier or customer Contract
under this _Section 4.21_ shall be offset by any revenue generated by a new
supplier or customer Contract entered into by the Company or any Subsidiary
between the date hereof and the Closing Date.

respective Subsidiaries is in good operating condition, ordinary wear and tear

presently being used. Casella and its Affiliates (other than the Companies and
their respective Subsidiaries) do not possess, or have the right to use, any
Personal Property owned or leased by the Companies or their respective
Subsidiaries, other than the Intellectual Property to be licensed back to
Casella and its Affiliates pursuant to the License Agreement. Except for the
services described in the Transition Services Agreement, the Personal Property
owned or leased by a Company and its Subsidiaries, together with all owned and
leased real property of such Company and its Subsidiaries, all owned, leased
or licensed Intellectual Property of such Company and its Subsidiaries, and

useable in the ordinary course of business.

 



 

Section 4.25 _Customer Warranties_. There are no pending, nor to the Knowledge

commitments, and none of the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries have, nor

agreements hereunder, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, there is no fact,
occurrence or condition that makes any of the assumptions or statements set
forth in any Commitment Letter inaccurate in any material respect or that
would cause the commitments provided in any Commitment Letter to be terminated
or rendered ineffective or any of the conditions contained therein not to be
met; _provided_ , _however_ , Purchaser expresses no opinion as to whether the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ will be satisfied.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Solvency_. Assuming the accuracy of Sellers representations and
warranties contained in _Article IV_ (but without giving effect to any

contained therein), immediately after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the closing of the Financing to the
Knowledge of Purchaser:

 



 

(a) Purchaser shall be able to pay its debts as they become due and shall own
property having a fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay
its debts (including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent
liabilities); and

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall have adequate capital to carry on its businesses.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Sponsor Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Purchaser has delivered to Casella a limited guarantee, dated the
date hereof, of each Sponsor duly executed in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ (each, a " _Sponsor Guaranty_ "). Each Sponsor Guaranty
constitutes a legal, valid, duly authorized and binding obligation of such
Sponsor, enforceable against such Sponsor in accordance with its terms, except
as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and by general equitable principles. No Sponsor
Guaranty has been amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement. No
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach or default under each Sponsor Guaranty.

 _COVENANTS_

 



 

Section 6.1 _Access to Information Concerning Properties and Records_.

 



 

(a) Casella shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, upon reasonable prior
notice and during regular business hours (but in a manner so as not to
unreasonably interfere with Casellas or its Subsidiaries normal business
operations), afford Purchaser and each of Purchasers Representatives and
financing sources, full access to the properties, books and records of the

 



      
 

 



 

Companies and their respective Subsidiaries to the extent Purchaser, or any of
its Representatives or financing sources reasonably believes necessary or
advisable to familiarize itself with such properties and other matters and,
during such period, Casella shall furnish promptly to Purchaser, Purchasers
Representatives and Purchasers financing sources, as applicable, all
financial and operating data and other information concerning the Companies
and their respective Subsidiaries businesses, properties and personnel as
Purchaser, such Representatives or such financing sources may reasonably
request.

 



 

(b) For each month, beginning January 2011, Casella shall cause the Companies
to provide Purchaser with an unaudited consolidated balance sheet and related
unaudited consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders
equity and cash flows for the month then ended with respect to the Companies
and their respective Subsidiaries within fifteen (15) days of the end of such
month (the " _Monthly Financial Statements_ "). The Monthly Financial
Statements, except as indicated therein, shall be prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the Financial Statements except that
they need not contain footnotes and will be subject to year-end audit
adjustments.

 



 

Section 6.2 _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until Closing, Purchaser and
Casella shall be bound by and comply with the obligations of the
Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with its terms. After the Closing, the
Parties shall remain bound by the Confidentiality Agreement solely with
respect to "Confidential Information" relating to any portion of the business
of a Seller and its respective Subsidiaries and other Affiliates that is not a
subject of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, except as
modified by this _Section 6.2(a)_, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in accordance with its terms, except that (i) Section 24 thereof
regarding non-solicitation is hereby superseded by _Section 6.9_ below and
shall no longer have any force or effect with respect to Persons bound by such
_Section 6.9_ and (ii) the obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive and remain in effect for a period of two (2) years after the
Closing.

 



 

(b) Casella acknowledges that it and its Subsidiaries are in possession of
Confidential Material concerning the Companies. From and after the Closing,
Casella shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to, treat
confidentially and not disclose all or any portion of such Confidential
Material and will use such Confidential Material solely for the purpose of
consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and for no other
purpose; _provided_ , that Casella and its Subsidiaries may also use the
Confidential Material for the purpose of operating their respective businesses
in the ordinary course (where such Confidential Material does not involve a
Trade Secret held for use in connection with FCR or one of its Subsidiaries
except pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement) and otherwise to the
extent necessary to engage in any business not restricted by the terms of
_Section 6.8_. Such Confidential Material is proprietary and confidential in
nature and may be disclosed to Casellas Representatives only to the extent
necessary in connection with Casellas permitted use thereof (it being
understood that Casella shall be responsible for any disclosure by any such
Representative not permitted by this Agreement). If Casella or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives are requested or required to disclose (after
Casella has used its commercially reasonable efforts to avoid such disclosure
and after promptly advising and consulting with Purchaser about Casellas
intention to make, and the

 



      
 

 



 

proposed contents of, such disclosure) any of the Confidential Material
(whether by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process), Casella shall, or shall cause such
Affiliate or Representative to, provide Purchaser with prompt written notice
of such request so that Purchaser may seek an appropriate protective order or
other appropriate remedy. At any time that such protective order or remedy has
not been obtained, Casella or such Affiliate or Representative may disclose
only that portion of the Confidential Material which such Person is legally
required to disclose or of which disclosure is required to avoid sanction for
contempt or any similar sanction, and Casella shall exercise its commercially
reasonable efforts, to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to such Confidential Material so disclosed. From and after the
Closing Date, Casella and its Affiliates and Representatives, upon the request
of Purchaser, shall promptly deliver to Purchaser all documents, or other
tangible embodiments, constituting Confidential Material or other information
with respect to Casella and its Subsidiaries, without retaining any copy
thereof except to the extent necessary for Casellas permitted use thereof,
and shall promptly destroy all other information and documents constituting or
containing Confidential Material.

respective customers or clients within [**] prior to the date of this
Agreement or (y) in any way seek to interfere with the relationship between
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries and any Person or business relationship

Purchaser and Casella). The Purchaser Competing Business Notice shall disclose
in reasonable detail the Purchaser Competing Business and include as
attachments, any relevant portions of definitive documents relating to the
acquisition of the Purchaser Competing Business contained in the Integrated
Solid Waste Company (as may be redacted by Casella to remove information not

materials prepared by Casella, any of its Subsidiaries, or their respective
Representatives relating to such Purchaser Competing Business and with access
to any information Casella or any of its Subsidiaries has received with
respect to any such Purchaser Competing Business (the " _Evaluation Material_
"), subject to Purchaser entering into a confidentiality agreement with
customary terms with Casella or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable.
Casella shall not enter into any agreement to sell such Purchaser Competing
Business to any other party until the date that is thirty (30) days after the
Purchaser Competing Business Notice has been given to Purchaser; _provided_ ,

share with Purchaser any evaluation materials prepared by Casella, one of its
Subsidiaries, or their respective Representatives relating to such Purchaser
Competing Business and information Casella or any of its Subsidiaries has
received with respect to any such Purchaser Competing Business and for

Business. Purchaser may elect to purchase the Purchaser Competing Business
described in the Purchaser Competing Business Notice by delivering a written
notice of such election to Casella within thirty (30) days following its
receipt of the Evaluation Material from Casella or such longer period
described in the immediately preceding sentence. If Purchaser does not elect
to purchase such Purchaser Competing Business and Casella consummates its
contemplated acquisition of a Integrated Solid Waste Company, Casella shall
pay a licensing fee to Purchaser of [**] Dollars ($[**]) per ton of salable or
reusable commodities (not including Baled Residue, as defined in the
Commodities Marketing

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement) shipped each month by such Purchaser Competing Business following
the closing of the contemplated acquisition, but only to the extent Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates maintains a facility in the applicable [**]-mile
radius as of such time. Casella and Purchaser agree that in the event that
Purchaser elects to purchase such Purchaser Competing Business from Casella
pursuant to this _Section 6.8(b)(i)_, the representations, warranties,
covenants and indemnification provisions (including limitations, which shall
be pro rata in relation to the overall purchase price, in the event a separate
limitation is not specified with respect to the Purchaser Competing Business)
with respect thereto shall be the same as Casella receives from and gives to
the seller of such Purchaser Competing Business, either in the form of an
assignment by Casella of its rights with respect to the Purchaser Competing
Business under its purchase agreement with the seller of the Purchaser
Competing Business or in the form of an agreement between Casella and
Purchaser on terms consistent with the foregoing.

 



 

(ii) If Casella acquires an Integrated Solid Waste Company as permitted in
_Section 6.8(a)(i)_ and such Integrated Solid Waste Company, at the time of
Casellas agreement to consummate such acquisition, owns and/or operates any
Purchaser Competing Business which is located outside a [**] mile radius of
any similar business operated by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates at such
time, Casella may operate such Purchaser Competing Business in its discretion;
provided, that if Casella decides, at any time, following such acquisition, to
(x) convert any such Purchaser Competing Business facility to single-stream
processing, (y) increase the capacity by [**] percent ([**]%) or more at such
facility or (z) build a new facility for such Purchaser Competing Business
(each, an " _Expansion_ "), Casella shall give prior written notice thereof
(the " _Expansion Notice_ ") to Purchaser and offer to Purchaser an
opportunity to jointly own (which joint venture would design, build and
operate the Expansion) the Expansion through a 50/50 Partnership. The
Expansion Notice shall disclose in reasonable detail the contemplated
Expansion. Purchaser may elect to purchase an interest in the Expansion
described in the Expansion Notice by delivering a written notice of such
election to Casella within thirty (30) days following delivery to Purchaser of
the Expansion Notice.

 



 

(c) _Purchaser s and Parents Non-Compete Obligation_. In consideration of
the sale of the Equity Interests by Sellers for the Final Purchase Price,
Purchaser has caused each of the executive officers listed on _Section
6.8(c)_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter to enter into a non-competition
agreement (a true and complete copy of such agreements is attached hereto as
_Exhibit G_) which agreement shall be effective only upon the Closing, and
from the date of this Agreement until the [**] anniversary of the Closing
Date, and subject to Purchasers right of first offer set forth in _Section
6.8(d)(i)_, Parent and Purchaser shall not, and shall cause their controlled
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly:

 



 

(i) in the Franchise Territory, directly or indirectly own, manage, operate,
control, be employed by or participate in the ownership, management, operation
or control of, or be connected in any manner with any business of the type and
character currently engaged in by Casella and its Subsidiaries in the
Franchise Territory, including without limitation, any business involving the
collection, recycling, disposal or diversion from disposal of municipal solid
waste or construction and demolition debris sourced from within the Franchise
Territory (any such business, a " _Seller Competing Business_ "). For these
purposes, the following shall not be considered to be a Seller Competing
Business: (A) ownership of securities of two percent (2%)

 



      
 

 



 

or less of any class of securities of a public company and (B) maintaining its
ownership interest in the Tompkins County JV;

 



 

(ii) persuade or attempt to persuade any Person not to hire Casella or such
Subsidiary, or to hire another Person, in each case, with respect to a Seller
Competing Business; or

 



 

(iii) solicit for the benefit of any Person other than Casella or any of its
Subsidiaries, the business (to the extent relating to a Seller Competing
Business) of any Person that is a customer or client of Casella or any of this
Subsidiaries, or was its customer or client within [**] prior to the date of
this Agreement or in any way seek to interfere with the relationship between
Casella or any of its Subsidiaries and any Person or business relationship
(relating solely to a Seller Competing Business) including making any negative
or disparaging statements or communications about Casella or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

From the date of this Agreement until the [**] anniversary of the Closing
Date, and subject to Purchasers right of first offer set forth in _Section
6.8(d)(i)_, Parent and Purchaser shall not authorize or allow any Person
(other than any of their respective controlled Affiliates to the extent
permitted pursuant to _Section 6.8_) to use any Companies Intellectual
Property within the Franchise Territory in connection with a Seller Competing
Business. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the preceding sentence of
this _Section 6.8(c)_, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit any buyer of
Parent or Purchaser or of any of their controlled Affiliates from conducting
business in the Franchise Territory other than through Parent or Parents
controlled entities (i.e., Company X shall not be prohibited from initiating
or continuing a Seller Competing Business in the Franchise Territory
notwithstanding its acquisition of Parent or Purchaser or any of their
controlled Affiliates, so long as such operations are not conducted by Parent
or Purchaser or any of their controlled Affiliates and so long as Company X
and its Affiliates (including Parent, Purchaser and their controlled
Affiliates) do not use any Companies Intellectual Property within the
Franchise Territory). The Parties agree that this restriction shall apply to
(i) any Companies Intellectual Property owned by the Companies at the Closing,
(ii) Intellectual Property developed through collaboration with Sellers after
the Closing, (iii) Intellectual Property developed by the Purchaser that
claims priority to or could have claimed priority to a patent or patent
application acquired by Purchaser from Sellers at the Closing or any
Intellectual Property developed through collaboration with Sellers after the
Closing and, (iv) while owned by Parent or any controlled Affiliate, any other
Intellectual Property, including Intellectual Property purchased by Purchaser
from third parties.

 



 

(d) _Right of First Offer_.

 



 

(i) Without limiting the foregoing, in the event Casella or one of its
Affiliates desires to seek an equity partner or operator for any facility to
be located within the Franchise Territory which is a Purchaser Capability (a "
_Business Opportunity_ "), Casella shall give prior written notice of the
Business Opportunity (the " _Offer Notice_ ") to Purchaser. The Offer Notice
shall disclose in reasonable detail the Business Opportunity, the desired
material terms and conditions of the Business Opportunity, including, any
payment terms or equity or debt arrangements contemplated by Casella. Casella
shall not enter into any agreement relating to the Business Opportunity with
any other party until the date that is thirty (30) days after the Offer

 



      
 

 



 

Notice has been given to Purchaser (the " _Authorization Date_ "). For
purposes hereof, " _Purchaser Capability_ " means a standalone materials
recovery facility or a facility for the manufacturing of Engineered Feedstock.

 



 

(ii) Purchaser may elect to participate in a Business Opportunity described in
an Offer Notice by delivering a written notice of such election to Casella
prior to the Authorization Date.

 



 

(iii) If Purchaser has not elected to participate in a Business Opportunity
described in the Offer Notice on or before the Authorization Date, or, if the
parties are unable to reach a definitive agreement within the ninety (90) day
period thereafter (the " _Negotiation Period_ "), Purchaser shall not be
entitled to such Business Opportunity and Casella or one of its Affiliates
may, during the one hundred eighty (180) day period immediately following the
expiration of the Negotiation Period, enter into the Business Opportunity
specified in the Offer Notice with another Person on terms not materially more
favorable to such Person, than those specified in the Offer Notice.

 



 

(e) The parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this _Section
6.8_ are ancillary to the transactions contemplated hereby. It is the desire
and intent of the Parties that the provisions of this _Section 6.8_ shall be
enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the Laws and public policies
applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. If any particular
provisions or portion of this _Section 6.8_ shall be adjudicated to be
invalid or unenforceable, this _Section 6.8_ shall be deemed amended to
delete therefrom such provision or portion adjudicated to be invalid or
unenforceable, such amendment to apply only with respect to the operation of
this _Section 6.8_ in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication
is made.

 



 

(f) The Parties recognize that the performance of the obligations under this
_Section 6.8 _by each Party is special, unique and extraordinary in
character, and that in the event of the breach by a Party of the terms and
conditions of this _Section 6.8_ to be performed by such Party, the other
Party shall be entitled, if they so elect, to obtain damages for any breach of
this _Section 6.8_, or to enforce the specific performance thereof by the
breaching Party or to enjoin the breaching Party or its Affiliates from
performing services for any Person.

 



 

(g) Without limiting the foregoing, each of the Parties agrees not to
challenge, and to cause its Affiliates not to challenge, the enforceability of
the provisions of this _Section 6.8_. In the event of the breach by a Party
of the terms and conditions of this _Section 6.8(g)_, the other Party shall
be entitled, if they so elect, to obtain damages for the breach of this
_Section 6.8(g)_, or to enforce the specific performance thereof by the
breaching Party or to enjoin the breaching Party or its Affiliates from
performing services for any Person.

 



 

(h) In the event of any Change of Control of Casella, the foregoing _Sections
6.8(a)  (g)_ shall terminate immediately upon the consummation of such
transaction.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Non-Solicitation of Employees_.

 



 

(a) _Generally_.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) From and after the Closing Date, Casella shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, for a period of [**] after the
Closing Date, knowingly solicit for employment any Transferred Employee or
employee of a Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date;
_provided_ , that this paragraph shall not preclude Casella or its Affiliates
from soliciting for employment or hiring any such employee who (i) responds on
such individuals own initiative to a general solicitation through a general
circulation advertising medium (whether written, electronic, radio or
otherwise) by or on behalf of Casella or any of its Affiliates that is not
targeted at Transferred Employees, (ii) contacts Casella or its Affiliates
directly on such individuals own initiative or (iii) is not then currently,
and has not been for a period of six (6) months, employed by Purchaser or its

(ii) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates (which, for the avoidance of doubt shall not include any portfolio
company of the Sponsors or any of their Affiliates except for Parent, the
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly,
for a period of [**] after the Closing Date, knowingly solicit for employment
any person who was an employee of Casella or any of its Affiliates on or prior
to the Closing Date (other than any Transferred Employee or employee of a
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date); _provided_ , that
this paragraph shall not preclude Purchaser or its Affiliates from soliciting
for employment or hiring any such employee who (i) responds on such
individuals own initiative to a general solicitation through a general
circulation advertising medium (whether written, electronic, radio or
otherwise) by or on behalf of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates that is not
targeted at employees of Casella or its Affiliates, (ii) contacts Purchaser or
its Affiliates directly on such individuals own initiative or (iii) is not
then currently, and has not been for a period of six (6) months, employed by
Casella or its Affiliates.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Casella and Purchaser shall not, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates (which, for the avoidance of doubt
shall not include any portfolio company of the Sponsors or any of their
Affiliates except for Parent, the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries)
not to, directly or indirectly, for a period of [**] after the Closing Date,
hire any Person listed on _Section 6.9(b)(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter
(in respect of Casella), and _Section 6.9(b)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter (in respect of Purchaser).

 



 

(c) The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this
_Section 6.9_ are ancillary to the transactions contemplated hereby. It is
the desire and intent of the Parties that the provisions of this _Section
6.9_ shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the Laws and
public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.
If any particular provisions or portion of this _Section 6.9_ shall be
adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, this _Section 6.9_ shall be
deemed amended to delete therefrom such provision or portion adjudicated to be
invalid or unenforceable, such amendment to apply only with respect to the
operation of this _Section 6.9_ in the particular jurisdiction in which such
adjudication is made.

 



 

(d) The Parties recognize that the performance of the obligations under this
_Section 6.9_ by Casella is special, unique and extraordinary in character,
and that in the event of the breach by Casella of the terms and conditions of
this _Section 6.9_ to be performed by Casella, Purchaser shall be entitled,
if it so elects, to obtain damages for any breach of this _Section 6.9_, or

 



      
 

 



 

to enforce the specific performance thereof by Casella or to enjoin any
employees of Casella or its Affiliates from performing services for any
Person.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Resignation of Officers and Directors_. At the written request
of Purchaser (which request shall be delivered at least three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing), Casella shall cause any so requested member of the
boards of managers, boards of directors or officer of each Company and its
Subsidiaries to tender his/her resignation from such position effective
immediately prior to the Closing Date and in the event any such individual
does not tender his/her resignation, Casella shall take such actions necessary
to remove such individuals from such positions.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Permits_. Commencing on the date of this Agreement, the Parties,
cooperating in good faith, shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
take such steps, including the filing of any required applications with any
Governmental Entity, as may be necessary to effect the transfer or re-issue of
the Permits necessary for the business of the Companies and their Subsidiaries
to Purchaser on or as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, to the
extent such transfer is permissible under applicable Law. To the extent such
Permits are not transferred or re-issued to Purchaser prior to the Closing,
the Parties shall enter into an agreement pursuant to which Casella shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such Permits remain in place to
the extent permitted by Law and necessary for the operation of the business of
the Companies and their Subsidiaries until such Permits are transferred or re-
issued to Purchaser.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Post-Closing Access to Records, Personnel and Real Property;
Litigation Support_.

 



 

(a) For a period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
preserve and retain, and make available to Casella upon Casellas reasonable
request, all corporate, accounting, Tax, legal, auditing, human resources and
other books and records of the Companies (including (i) any documents relating
to any action, claim, lawsuit, demand, inquiry, hearing, investigation, notice
of a violation or noncompliance, litigation, proceeding, arbitration, appeal
or other dispute, and (ii) all Tax Returns, schedules, work papers and other
material records or other documents relating to Taxes of the Companies)
relating to the conduct of the Companies prior to the Closing Date that
Purchaser receives from Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during such
seven (7) year period, Purchaser may dispose of any such books and records
which are offered in writing to, but not accepted by, Casella.

 



 

(b) If and for so long as either Party actively is contesting or defending
against any action, claim, lawsuit, demand, inquiry, hearing, investigation,
notice of a violation or noncompliance, litigation, proceeding, arbitration,
appeal or other dispute, brought by a third party in connection with (i) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing
Date involving Companies and their respective Subsidiaries, the non-contesting
or non defending Party shall reasonably cooperate with the contesting or
defending Party and its counsel, which cooperation will include, but not be
limited to, the following: (A) if requested by the contesting or defending
Party, the non-contesting or non-defending Party will instruct its officers,
directors and employees to (x)

 



      
 

 



 

appear for interviews, at reasonable times and locations, and (y) answer all
questions truthfully concerning the contesting or defending Party, the
Companies or concerning their work for the Companies or one of their
respective Subsidiaries, (B) the non-contesting or non-defending Party will
produce all of the non-privileged documents relating to the claim within the
non-contesting or non-defending Partys custody and control, which it is
reasonably requested to produce by the contesting or defending Party, and (C)
upon reasonable notice from the contesting or defending Party, the non-
contesting or non-defending Party shall instruct its officers, directors and
employees to (x) appear for hearings, depositions and at trial (including as
witnesses) related to any such claim, lawsuit, demand, inquiry, hearing,
investigation, notice of a violation or noncompliance, litigation, proceeding,
arbitration, appeal or other dispute, and (y) meet with the Representatives of
the contesting or defending Party to assist in preparation for such
depositions and trials, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or
defending Party (unless the contesting or defending Party is entitled to
indemnification therefore as provided in _Article VIII_). All information
received pursuant to this _Section 6.12_ will be kept confidential. Each
Party agrees that it will not, and it will not permit any of its Affiliates
to, bring or support any other party in bringing any claim, action or
proceeding in any court other than as permitted under _Section 11.9_ and
_Section 11.10_.

 



 

Section 6.13 _Employee Relations and Benefits_.

 



 

(a) It is understood by the parties hereto that the employment of the
employees of the Companies and their Subsidiaries shall continue immediately
following the Closing uninterrupted by the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on substantially similar terms and conditions in the aggregate as
prior to the Closing except as otherwise provided in this _Section 6.13(a)_,
except for such employees of FCR and their Subsidiaries listed in _Section
6.13(a)(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter who are operating in the Franchise
Territory and who shall be transferred by Casella to become employees of
Casella or any of its other Affiliates prior to the Closing (the " _Retained
Employees_ "). Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
controlled Affiliates to, offer at-will employment to the employees listed on
_Section 6.13(a)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the " _Business
Employees_ "), and the employment by Casella or its Subsidiaries of any such
Business Employee who shall have accepted such offer of employment shall
terminate effective as of the Closing Date and commence with Purchaser as of
the Closing Date (any such Business Employee who are offered and commence
employment with the Purchaser or its controlled Affiliates on the Closing
Date, a " _Transferred Employee_ ," and all such employees, collectively, the
" _Transferred Employees_ "). Effective on the Closing Date, Casella and any
applicable Subsidiary of Casella hereby waives and releases any non-compete or
other restrictions which would prevent any Business Employee from accepting
such employment offer from, and/or performing duties with any Person;
_provided_ however that any restrictions contained in any employment agreement
with such Business Employee shall survive other than any non-competition
provision therein, which shall be terminated and replaced by the noncompete
provisions in the form of _Exhibit G_. Casella shall also provide such waiver
in a separate form satisfactory to Purchaser to be provided to such Business
Employee, which shall expressly release such Business Employee from any
obligations they may have to Casella in order allow them to accept an
employment offer from and/or perform duties with, Purchaser (or a controlled
Affiliate of Purchaser, as applicable), or to a successor to Purchaser or
controlled Affiliate of Purchaser. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, Casella shall retain responsibility for the payment of any employee
benefits or entitlements pursuant to any

 



      
 

 



 

Employee Benefit Plan or Law, including severance pay that may be due to any
employee of the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries or to any Transferred
Employee as a result of or in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or in connection with their employment prior
to the Closing Date except to the extent any such payments are payable under
Law or under an employee benefit plan of Purchaser as a result of the
termination of any employee of FCR or one of its Subsidiaries or any
Transferred Employee by Purchaser after the Closing; _provided_ , however,
that with respect to any accrued but unused vacation, sick, personal or
similar paid time off (" _PTO_ ") to which any such employee is entitled
immediately prior to the Closing Date to the extent included as an FCR
Transaction Expense, Purchaser shall assume the liability for such PTO and
allow such employees of the Companies to use, in accordance with procedures
established by Purchaser, such PTO and, if such employees employment with
Purchaser terminates for any reason, Purchaser shall pay such employees the
balance of any such unused PTO.

 



 

(b) Except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth in this _Section 6.13_
or in the Transition Services Agreement, (i) Purchaser shall not be obligated
to assume, continue or maintain any of the Employee Benefit Plans; (ii) no
assets or liabilities of the Employee Benefit Plans shall be transferred to,
or assumed by, Purchaser or Purchasers benefit plans; and (iii) Casella and
its Subsidiaries (other than the Companies) shall be solely responsible for
funding or paying any benefits under any of the Employee Benefit Plans,
including any termination benefits and other employee entitlements accrued
under such plans by or attributable to employees of Casella and its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) Except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth in this _Section 6.13_
or in the Transition Services Agreement, (i) Casella shall take such action as
is necessary such that, as of the Closing Date, the Companies and their
Subsidiaries and the Transferred Employees cease participation in each
Employee Benefit Plan, (ii) Casella and its Affiliates (other than the
Companies and their Subsidiaries) shall retain all Liabilities for claims
under the Employee Benefit Plans, whether such claims are made before, on or
after the Closing Date, and (iii) Casella shall be solely responsible for
paying and providing long-term disability and any applicable life insurance
benefits due with respect to any employee of the Companies and their
Subsidiaries (and any individual formerly employed by the Companies and their
Subsidiaries) who is currently receiving long-term disability benefits as of
the Closing Date; provided that if and when such disabled employee is no
longer eligible to receive long-term disability benefits, and is ready,
willing and able to return to full-time employment within one (1) year
following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall offer at-will employment to such
individual.

 



 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall: (i) confer upon any
employee of Casella or its Subsidiaries, or any Representative of any such
employee, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or
continued employment for any period or terms of employment, for any nature
whatsoever, or (ii) be interpreted to prevent or restrict Purchaser or its
Affiliates from modifying or terminating the employment or terms of employment
of any Transferred Employee or any employees of a Company or its Subsidiaries
including the amendment or termination of any employee benefit or compensation
plan, program or arrangement, after the Closing Date, except to the extent
otherwise expressly set forth in this _Section 6.13_. For the avoidance of
doubt, Casella and its Affiliates shall not be obligated to amend or terminate
any Employee Benefit Plan pursuant to which such Transferred Employees

 



       
 

 



 

or any employees of a Company or its Subsidiaries continue to participate in
after the Closing pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement.

 



 

(e) Casella shall permit, and cause its Subsidiaries to permit, Purchaser to
contact and make arrangements with the Business Employees and/or the employees
of the Companies and their Subsidiaries regarding employment or prospective
employment by Purchaser on and after the Closing and for the purpose of
ensuring the continuity of the business of the Companies and their
Subsidiaries, and Casella shall not discourage, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to discourage, any such employees from consulting with
Purchaser; _provided_ , however, that any such contact and/or consultation
shall occur only at such times and in such manner as has been mutually agreed
upon, with such mutual agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, by Purchaser
and Casella so as not to interfere with Casellas or its Subsidiaries normal
business operations. Casella shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make
available to Purchaser such personnel information and similar information as
Purchaser may request with respect to any Transferred Employee, including
compensation and employment records, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law.

 



 

(f) Casella shall be solely responsible for compliance with the requirements
of Section 4980B of the Code and part 6 of subtitle B of Title I of ERISA ("
_COBRA_ "), including the provision of continuation coverage (within the
meaning of COBRA), with respect to all employees and former employees of the
Companies and their Subsidiaries and/or the Business Employees, and their
respective spouses and dependents, for whom a qualifying event (within the
meaning of COBRA) occurs at any time prior to or on the Closing Date under any
group health plan of Casella or its Affiliates.

 



 

(g) Casella shall take such action as is necessary to provide that all
Transferred Employees and any employees of the Companies and their
Subsidiaries who are participants in the Casella Waste Systems 401(k) Plan
(the " _Seller 401(k) Plan_") have a fully vested and nonforfeitable interest
in their entire respective account balances under such plan as of the Closing
Date (regardless of their years of vesting credit under the Seller 401(k)
Plan). On or prior to the Closing Date, with respect to all Transferred
Employees and any employees of the Companies or their Subsidiaries, Casella
shall contribute all contributions to the Seller 401(k) Plan which are
required to be made on or before the Closing Date under the Seller 401(k)
Plan, and within five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date, Casella
shall make all contributions to the Seller 401(k) Plan which relate to service
or employee salary deferral contributions on or prior to the Closing Date,
_provided_ that any employer contribution to such Seller 401(k) Plan will be
made only with respect to employees of the Companies who have satisfied the
requirements for such contributions under the terms of the Seller 401(k) Plan
other any "last day" or similar service obligation otherwise applicable.
Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall establish a retirement plan
intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code (the " _Purchaser 401
Plan_ "). Purchaser shall permit rollover contributions of any amounts
maintained by a Transferred Employee or an employee of Companies or their
Subsidiaries under the Seller 401(k) Plan to the Purchaser 401 Plan, including
the rollover of participant loans under the Seller 401(k) Plan. In addition,
as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall establish a medical spending
account and dependent care plan under Section 125 Plan of the Code (the "
_Purchaser Cafeteria Plan_ ") and shall, upon Casella providing Purchaser with
specific details relating thereto, credit to accounts established for
employees of the Companies all amounts credited

 



      
 

 



 

under accounts of a similar Employee Benefit Plan, net of any amounts for
which such employees have received reimbursement. Once the administrators of
the Purchaser Cafeteria Plan and Casellas similar Employee Benefit Plan have
determined how to address the claims made by employees of the Companies and
Transferred Employees following the Closing (but which arose prior to the
Closing) so that the net account balances under Purchaser Cafeteria Plan can
be established, Casella shall cause to be transferred to Purchaser an amount
in cash equal to the excess of the aggregate accumulated contributions to the
flexible spending reimbursement accounts under the medical spending account
and dependent care plan under Section 125 Plan of the Code made during the
year in which the Closing Date occurs by the employees of the Companies over
the aggregate reimbursement payouts made for such year from such accounts to
such employees as of the agreed upon transfer date.

 



 

(h) Each Transferred Employee and each employee of the Companies or their
Subsidiaries shall be credited under employee benefit plans established and
maintained by Purchaser or any Affiliate with all service which was credited
to such employee while employed by Casella or any Subsidiaries for purposes of
vesting and eligibility and for purposes of determining the level of benefits
(other than under any defined benefit plan, severance plan or retiree medical
plan). In addition, Purchaser shall waive any pre-existing condition, actively
at work, evidence of insurability, waiting period requirement or similar
provisions, under any employee benefit plan with respect to any Transferred
Employee and each employee of the Companies or their Subsidiaries to the
extent satisfied under any Employee Benefit Plan. Provided the Seller provides
Purchaser with the necessary records within a reasonable period of time after
the Closing, Purchaser shall also credit, under each comparable employee
benefit plan of Purchaser, each Transferred Employee or employee of the
Companies or their Subsidiaries with any deductibles paid under any Employee
Benefit Plan for the plan year in which the Closing occurs; _provided_ ,
however, that following the period under the Transition Service Agreement
applicable to health insurance, credit of payments towards out-of-pocket
maximums shall only be provided upon the consent of the carrier selected as
the insurance provider for Purchasers group medical plan.

 



 

(i) Purchaser or its controlled Affiliates, as the case may be (each of such
Purchaser and Affiliates employing any Transferred Employee being a "
_Successor Employer_ ") shall as of the Closing Date succeed to and assume the
immigration-related interests, liabilities, and obligations of Casella or its
Subsidiaries related to any Transferred Employee.

 



 

Section 6.14 _Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act_. Sellers
shall be liable, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, for any
obligations and liabilities under WARN (a) arising prior to the Closing Date
with respect to the Transferred Employees or any current or former employee of
the Companies or their Subsidiaries (other than the Retained Employees) and
(b) arising on, prior to or after the Closing Date with respect to the
Retained Employees, the Business Employees (other than the Transferred
Employees) and any other current or former employee of Casella or its
Subsidiaries. Purchaser shall be liable, and shall indemnify and hold harmless
Seller, for any obligations and liabilities under WARN arising on or after the
Closing Date with respect to any employee of the Companies or their
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date and any Transferred Employee. On or before
the Closing Date, Sellers, on behalf of the Companies and their Subsidiaries,
shall provide a list, by location, of all employees of the Companies and their
Subsidiaries who have experienced "employment losses" (as defined

 



      
 

 



 

under WARN) within ninety (90) days prior to the Closing Date or have been
notified by the Companies or their Subsidiaries that they will experience
"employment losses" after the Closing Date and Sellers, on behalf of the
Companies and their Subsidiaries, shall update this list up to and including
the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 6.15 _Insurance Matters_.

 



 

(a) Coverage of the tangible or intangible personal property, liabilities,
ownership, activities, businesses, operations, officers, employees and agents
of the Companies and their Subsidiaries (the " _Covered Assets and Persons_ ")
under all current or previous insurance policies maintained by Casella and its
Subsidiaries (the " _Seller Corporate Policies_ "), shall cease as of the
Closing Date and the Covered Assets and Persons shall be deleted in all
respects as insureds (or additional insureds, as the case may be) with regard
to any occurrences or wrongful acts which occur after the Closing Date under
all Seller Corporate Policies, with the exception of any insurance policies
described in _Section 6.15_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter. To the extent
that there is any claim pending or made as of the date hereof or thereafter
under any Seller Corporate Policy relating to the Covered Assets and Persons,
Casella shall pursue such claim with reasonable diligence (or at the request
of Purchaser, Casella shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause Purchaser
to be subrogated in respect of any such claim) and promptly following the
resolution of such claim (but not before the Closing), remit any proceeds (net
of any deductible, costs of recovery, and other costs required to be paid, or
incurred, by Casella with respect thereto) received in respect of such claim
to Purchaser. Any such proceeds received or pending claims relating to the
Covered Assets and Persons prior to the Closing shall be excluded from the
calculation of the Closing Working Capital. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
from and after the Closing, Seller agrees (i) to maintain the Seller Corporate
Policies in order to provide insurance coverage for any occurrences or alleged
wrongful acts which occurred prior to the Closing (regardless of when such
occurrences or alleged wrongful acts may be reported), (ii) to remain
responsible for fulfilling all financial obligations related to the Seller
Corporate Policies, including, without limitation, the payment of all
deductibles, costs of recovery, and other costs required to be paid, or
incurred, with respect to any claims under any Seller Corporate Policy
relating to any such occurrences or alleged wrongful acts which occurred prior
to the Closing, and (iii) to notify the insurers of any claims related to any
such occurrences or alleged wrongful acts which occurred prior to the Closing
and to use commercially reasonable efforts to administer such claims and
deliver to the Companies or their Subsidiaries the proceeds related to such
claims for the life of such Seller Corporate Policies. Seller agrees that so
long as it maintains director and officer, employment practices and fiduciary
liability insurance policies, such policies shall cover the Companies and
their Subsidiaries with respect to Losses incurred as a result of any
occurrences, wrongful acts or events which occurred prior to the Closing.

 



 

(b) If, after the Closing Date, Purchaser or Casella (or any of their
respective Affiliates) reasonably requires any information regarding claims
data or other information pertaining to a claim or an Occurrence that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim (including any pre-Closing
claims under the Seller Corporate Policies) in order to give notice to or make
filings with insurance carriers or claims adjustors or administrators or to
adjust, administer or otherwise manage a claim, then Casella or Purchaser, as
the case may be, shall cause such information to be supplied to the other (or
its designee), to the extent such information is in its possession and control
or can be reasonably obtained by Casella or

 



      
 

 



 



 

Purchaser (or their respective Affiliates), as applicable, promptly upon a
written request therefor. In furtherance of the foregoing, if any third party
requires the consent of Casella or any of its Affiliates to the disclosure of
claims data or information maintained by an insurance company or other third
party in respect of any claim (including any pre-Closing claims under any
Seller Corporate Policies), such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 



 

Section 6.16 _Intellectual Property_.

 



 

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date,
Sellers shall, and shall cause the Companies and their Subsidiaries to, pursue
any claim that arises related to the material violation, infringement, misuse,
or misappropriation by any third party (including any employee or former
employee of any Seller or its Subsidiaries including the Companies and their
Subsidiaries) of any Companies Intellectual Property or the rights thereto or
in connection therewith, or any other claim that Sellers or their
Subsidiaries, including the Companies and their Subsidiaries, would have
pursued in the ordinary course of business prior to the date of this Agreement
in each case, if and only if the failure to pursue the same would materially
prejudice the Sellers or their Subsidiaries, including the Companies and
their Subsidiaries, rights with respect thereto.

 



 

(b) At and after the Closing, Sellers shall, at their own expense, effect
physical and legal transfer of all files, documents, books and other records
relating to the Companies Intellectual Property and the prosecution,
maintenance, enforcement or defense of the Companies Intellectual Property,
including all such files, documents, books and other records held by any
outside counsel to Seller or the Companies. Sellers shall, at their own
expense, reasonably cooperate with Purchaser and its attorneys in (i) the
processing of any change in ownership of any of the Companies Intellectual
Property, (ii) the provision of conception or reduction to practice
information, statements or affidavits of use, (iii) transfer of knowledge
about any Trade Secrets within the Companies Intellectual Property and (iv)
other factual or technical support reasonably necessary for Purchaser to
transfer, prosecute, enforce or defend the Companies Intellectual Property.
Such actions may include having employees or consultants of Sellers and their
Affiliates execute assignment documentation confirming Purchasers, the
Companies and their Subsidiaries rights in and to the Companies Intellectual
Property.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall execute documentation, in a form
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, that assigns all right, title and interest
in and to the Sellers Transferred IP, including the rights to pursue all
claims for past, present and future infringements, misappropriations or
violations of the Sellers Transferred IP, to one of the Companies or their
Subsidiaries as designated by Purchaser.

 



 

(d) Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, Casella hereby grants to
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries a royalty-free, paid-up, non-exclusive,
perpetual license to make, have made, import, copy, use, modify, enhance,
prepare derivative works of, offer for sale, sell and otherwise provide or
distribute products and services incorporating or based on any non-patented
information (which includes "know how" for each use of such term in this
Agreement) which is directly applicable to the production and processing of
Engineered Feedstock (other than such non-patented information which is
included within the Sellers Transferred IP) and in the possession of the
Business Employees immediately following the Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.17 _Further Assurances_. At any time and from time to time after the
Closing Date, without further consideration, each Party, at the reasonable
request of the other Party, shall execute and deliver such further instruments
of conveyance, assignment, assumption and transfer with respect to the Equity
Interests and Companies Intellectual Property and take such further action as
may be necessary or appropriate in order to (a) effectuate the intent of this
Agreement, (b) perfect or record title of Purchaser in the Equity Interests
and Companies Intellectual Property, (c) put Purchaser in possession of the
Equity Interests and Companies Intellectual Property and (d) provide such
other Party in all respects with the intended benefits of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.18 _Release of Liens_. As soon as practicable following the date
hereof, Casella shall: (a) request that the pledge of the Equity Interests
pursuant to the terms of the Seller Pledge Agreement, any Liens and security
interests on the property and assets of the Companies and any of their
Subsidiaries under the Seller Loan Documents, including the Companies
Intellectual Property and the guarantee of the Companies and their
Subsidiaries pursuant to the Seller Indentures, in each case, be released on
or prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the terms thereof and (b) take
all such other action as shall be necessary to cause such pledge, Liens and
security interests and all other Liens thereunder to which the Companies and
any of their Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets are
bound or subject to be fully released on or prior to the Closing Date in a
manner satisfactory to Purchaser.

 



 

Section 6.19 _Use of Proceeds_. On or after the Closing Date, Casella shall
cause the Initial Purchase Price and any Purchase Price Adjustment payable to
Sellers, in each case, when and if paid, to be applied in the manner required
by the Seller Loan Documents.

 



 

Section 6.20 _Equity Financing Commitments_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section
6.20(d)_, Parent acknowledges that it shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to consummate the Equity Financing and Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions,
and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary, proper or advisable to

investment affiliates (and the rights of Purchaser) under the equity
Commitment Letters (which may include, at the request of Casella, filing one
or more lawsuits against the Sponsors); _provided_ , _however_ , that neither
Purchaser nor Parent shall have any obligation under this _Section 6.20(a)_
after the End Date (it being understood that on such date Purchaser may
terminate any litigation it has commenced or any other actions it has taken
pursuant to this _Section 6.20(a)_.

 



 

(b) Parent shall not amend, alter or waive, or agree to amend, alter or waive
(in any case whether by action or inaction), any term of the Equity Commitment
Letters without the prior written consent of Casella (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent agrees to notify
Casella promptly, and in any event within one (1) Business Day, if at any time
prior to the Closing Date (i) the Equity Commitment Letters expire or are

 



      
 

 



 

terminated for any reason (or if any person attempts or purports to terminate
the Equity Commitment Letters, whether or not such attempted or purported
termination is valid), (ii) the Sponsors refuse to provide, express an intent
to refuse to provide or express any concern or reservation regarding its
obligation or ability to provide the full Equity Financing on the terms set
forth in the Equity Commitment Letters or (iii) for any reason Parent no
longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain all or any
portion of the Equity Financing on the terms set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letters.

 



 

(c) Immediately prior to the Closing, upon its receipt of any Equity
Financing, Parent shall distribute all such Equity Financing to Purchaser.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this _Section 6.20_ shall require, and in no event shall
commercially reasonable efforts of Purchaser or Parent be deemed or construed
to require, Purchaser or Parent to (i) seek Equity Financing from any source
other than those counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that
contemplated by, an Equity Financing Letter or (ii) pay any fees in excess of
those contemplated by the Equity Financing Letters (whether to secure waiver
of any conditions contained therein or otherwise).

 



 

Section 6.21 _Debt Financing Commitments_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser
acknowledges that it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters (or terms, including with respect to the conditionality
thereof, not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Purchaser),
including by using commercially reasonable efforts to (i) maintain in effect
each Debt Commitment Letter and negotiating a definitive agreement
(collectively, the " _Debt Financing Agreements_ ") with respect to each Debt
Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions set forth in such Debt
Commitment Letter (or on terms, including with respect to the conditionality
thereof, not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Purchaser than the
terms and conditions in such Debt Commitment Letter), (ii) comply with all
covenants and agreements of Purchaser set forth in each Debt Commitment Letter
and Debt Financing Agreement and (iii) consummate the Debt Financing at or
prior to the Closing. In the event that all conditions in a Debt Commitment
Letter (other than the availability of funding of any of the Equity
Financing), or upon funding will be satisfied, Purchaser shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the lender party to such Debt
Commitment Letter to fund on the Closing Date the Debt Financing required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise
enforce its rights under such Debt Commitment Letter. Purchaser will furnish
correct and complete copies of any Debt Financing Agreement to Casella
promptly upon the execution thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser
shall not have any obligation under this _Section 6.21_ after the End Date
(it being understood that on such date Purchaser may terminate any actions it
has taken pursuant to this _Section 6.21_).

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall keep Casella informed with respect to all material
activity concerning the Debt Financing and shall give Casella prompt notice of
any material adverse change with respect to the Debt Financing. Without
limiting the foregoing, Purchaser agrees to notify Casella promptly, and in
any event within one (1) Business Day, if at any time prior to the Closing
Date (i) a Debt Commitment Letter expires or is terminated for any reason (or
if any

 



      
 

 



 

person attempts or purports to terminate a Debt Commitment Letter, whether or
not such attempted or purported termination is valid), (ii) the lender refuses
to provide, expresses an intent to refuse to provide or expresses any concern
or reservation regarding its obligation or ability to provide all or any
portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by a Debt Commitment Letter on the
conditions set forth therein or (iii) for any reason Purchaser no longer
believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain all or any portion of
the Debt Financing on substantially the terms described in the Debt Commitment
Letters. Without the prior written consent of Casella (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Purchaser shall not, nor
shall it permit any of its controlled Affiliates to, take any action or enter
into any transaction, including any merger, acquisition, joint venture,
disposition, lease, contract or debt or equity financing, that could
reasonably be expected to impair, delay or prevent consummation of all or any
portion of the Debt Financing. Without the prior written consent of Casella,
Purchaser shall not amend or alter, or agree to amend or alter, a Debt
Commitment Letter in any manner that would impair, delay or prevent the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(c) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated in a Debt Commitment Letter or a Debt
Financing Agreement, until the End Date, Purchaser shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange to promptly obtain such Debt Financing from
alternative sources on terms, including with respect to the conditionality
thereof, not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Purchaser and in an
amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing that is
otherwise available, together with any cash and cash equivalents held by
Purchaser as of the Closing, to pay in cash all amounts required to be paid by
it in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Initial Purchase Price or Final Purchase Price, as applicable,
and all payments, fees and expenses of Purchaser related to or arising out of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (an " _Alternative Debt
Financing_ ") and to obtain one or more new financing commitment letters
(each, an " _Alternative Debt Commitment Letter_ ") and one or more new
definitive agreements (each, an " _Alternative Debt Financing Agreement_ ")
providing therefor. In such event, the term "Debt Financing" as used in this
Agreement shall be deemed to include any Alternative Debt Financing, the term
"Debt Commitment Letters" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to include
any Alternative Debt Commitment Letter and the term "Debt Financing Agreement"
as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to include any Alternative Debt
Financing Agreement. Purchaser will furnish correct and complete copies of any
Alternative Debt Commitment Letter or Alternative Debt Financing Agreement to
Casella promptly upon its execution.

 



 

(d) Casella agrees to provide Purchaser with such cooperation in connection
with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by
Purchaser and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause appropriate
officers and employees of Seller, the Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries (i) to be available on a customary basis to meet with prospective
lenders, (ii) to assist with the preparation of disclosure documents, offering
documents, information memoranda, projections and similar documents in
connection therewith, (iii) to furnish Purchaser and Purchasers financing
sources with financial statements and financial and other pertinent
information regarding the Companies and their Subsidiaries, as may be
reasonably requested by Purchaser, (iv) to execute and deliver any definitive
financing documentation, security documents, hedging arrangements, customary
certificates, legal opinions (which may be reasoned, if counsel reasonably
believes it cannot give the opinion otherwise) or

 



      
 

 



 

other documents as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with
the financing for the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case which
will become effective only on or after the Closing, (v) to take such
reasonable actions as may be required to facilitate the pledge of collateral
to secure such financing (including cooperation in connection with the pay-off
of existing Indebtedness and the release of Liens related thereto), (vi) to
obtain all waivers, consents and approvals from other parties to Contracts and
Liens to which the Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries is a
party or by which any of them, their assets or properties or the Purchased
Assets are bound or subject, and (vii) to take all other actions necessary to
permit the consummation of the financing contemplated by Commitment Letters.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Casella nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any
other liability in connection with the Debt Financing. Purchaser shall,
promptly upon request by Casella, reimburse Casella for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs incurred by Casella or any of its subsidiaries in connection with
such cooperation. All non-public or otherwise confidential information
regarding Casella or its Subsidiaries obtained by Purchaser or its
representatives or financing sources pursuant to this _Section 6.21(d)_ shall
be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
nothing in this _Section 6.21_ shall require, and in no event shall
commercially reasonable efforts of Purchaser be deemed or construed to
require, Purchaser to (i) incur the Debt Financing on terms materially less
favorable, in the aggregate, to Purchaser than those contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter or (ii) pay any fees in excess of those contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letters (whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained
therein or otherwise).

 



 

Section 6.22 _Conduct of Business by Purchaser Prior to the Closing_.
Purchaser agrees that, between the date hereof and the Closing, except as
contemplated by this Agreement, it shall not, directly or indirectly, without
the prior written consent of Casella, take or cause to be taken any action
that could by expected to materially delay, impair or prevent the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or propose, announce an
intention, enter into any agreement or otherwise make a commitment to take any
such action.

 



 

Section 6.23 _Replacement of Guarantees, Performance Bonds and Letters of
Credit_. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Casella, Purchaser shall
arrange, within 180 days following the Closing, for replacement arrangements
(which shall include a full and complete release of each Seller and their
respective Affiliates (other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries)), of
all guarantees, performance bonds and letters of credit, reasonably
satisfactory to Casella with respect to all obligations of the Companies and
their Subsidiaries which are subject to any guarantee, covenant, indemnity,
bond or similar assurance provided by Casella or any of its Affiliates (other
than the Companies and their Subsidiaries) as of the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 6.24 _Reimbursement for Certain Assets of the Companies_. Purchaser
shall reimburse Casella for costs and expenses required to be paid by Casella
following the Closing for those certain automobiles, telephones and other
assets set forth on _Section 6.24_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, as used
by the Companies or their Subsidiaries as of the date hereof. Such
reimbursement shall be made monthly following receipt of invoices therefor
from Casella. If Casellas costs related to any of the foregoing are
increased, Casella shall promptly notify

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser of such increase and Purchaser shall have the right to terminate its
use of any automobile, telephones or other assets referred to in _Section
6.24_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, subject to payment by Purchaser of all
termination fees payable by Casella with respect thereto, if any.

 



 

Section 6.25 _Transfer of Claverack Facility and USGF_. Prior to the Closing,
Sellers shall take all necessary actions to complete the transfer of the

audits or similar events with respect to Taxes relating to a taxable period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date for which Sellers may be liable under
this Agreement (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar event, a
" _Tax Matter_ "). Casella, or its Representative, at Casellas sole expense,
shall have the authority to represent the interests of Casella and its
Affiliates and the Companies and their Subsidiaries, as applicable, with
respect to any Tax Matter before the IRS, any other Tax authority or any other
Governmental Entity and shall have the right to control the defense,
compromise or other resolution of any Tax Matter, including responding to
inquiries, and contesting, defending against and resolving any assessment for
additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of,
or relating to, a Tax Matter; _provided_ , that none of Casella or any of its
Affiliates shall enter into any settlement of or otherwise compromise any Tax
Matter that adversely affects or may adversely affect the Tax liability of
Purchaser, the Companies or their Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of the
foregoing for any period ending after the Closing Date, including the portion
of the Overlap Period that is after the Closing Date, without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Casella or its Representative shall keep
Purchaser fully and timely informed with respect to the commencement, status
and nature of any Tax Matter. Casella shall, in good faith, allow Purchaser to
make comments to Casella or its Representative, regarding the conduct of or
positions taken in any such proceeding. Purchaser shall provide or cause
another entity to provide to Sellers and/or any of their Affiliates and/or
their representatives powers of attorney as may reasonably be requested by
Sellers in order to exercise their rights under this _Section 8.3_; provided,
however, that such powers shall permit the designee to act only with respect
to the specific Tax Matters at issue for which Sellers may be liable under
this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 8.3(a)_, or if Casella does not
elect to control a Tax Matter pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_, Purchaser shall
have the sole right to control any audit or examination by any Tax authority,
initiate any claim for refund, amend any Tax Return, and contest, resolve and
defend against any assessment for additional Taxes, notice of Tax deficiency
or other adjustment of Taxes of or relating to, the income, assets or
operations of the Companies and their Subsidiaries for all taxable periods;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the
Companies and their Subsidiaries not to enter into any settlement of any
contest or otherwise compromise any issue with respect to the portion of the
Overlap Period ending on or prior to the Closing Date that could increase the
Tax liability of Sellers without the prior written consent of Casella, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Indemnification for Taxes_. Sellers (jointly and severally) shall
defend and hold Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Companies and
their Subsidiaries) and their respective members, stockholders,
Representatives, partners, managers, officers and directors harmless on an
after-tax basis from and against: (i) all Taxes and Losses suffered, incurred
or paid, directly or indirectly, by Purchaser and its Affiliates (including
the Company and its Subsidiaries) as a result of, arising out of, or related
to any failure of any representation or warranty made pursuant to _Section
4.14_ to be true and correct in all respects (without giving effect to any
"material", "materially", "materiality", "Material Adverse Effect", "material
adverse effect", "material adverse change" or similar qualification contained
therein) on and as of the date of this Agreement and on and as of the Closing
Date as if made on such date (other than those made on a specified date, which
shall be true and correct in all respects as of such specified date); (ii) all
Taxes imposed on, asserted against or attributable to the properties, income
or operations of the Companies and their Subsidiaries or any Taxes for which
the Companies and their Subsidiaries are otherwise liable, for all Pre-Closing
Periods and (iii) all Taxes imposed on the Companies and their Subsidiaries as
a result of the provisions of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or the
analogous provisions of any state, local or foreign law. In no event shall
Sellers be liable for Taxes to the extent the amount of Taxes are included in
the computation of Closing Working Capital and Purchaser shall indemnify,
defend and hold Sellers and their Affiliates and their representative members,
stockholders, partners, managers, officers, directors and agents harmless on
an after-tax basis from and against all Taxes of the Companies and their
Subsidiaries for all Post-Closing Periods and Taxes of the Companies and their
Subsidiaries resulting solely from actions, that are not in the ordinary
course of business, taken or caused to be taken by Purchaser on the Closing
Date after the Closing.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Post-Closing Access and Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) After the Closing Date, Purchaser, the Companies and their Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information and assistance (including access to books, records, work papers
and Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Periods) relating to the Companies and their
Subsidiaries as is reasonably necessary for the preparation of any Tax Return,
claim for refund or audit, and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit
or proceeding relating to any proposed Tax adjustment. Upon reasonable notice,
Sellers and Purchaser shall make their, or shall cause the Companies or their
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to make their, employees and

 



      
 

 



 

facilities available on a mutually convenient basis to provide reasonable
explanation of any documents or information provided hereunder.

 



 

(b) Any request for information or documents pursuant to this _Section 8.5_
shall be made by the requesting Party in writing. The other Party shall
promptly (and in no event later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the
request) provide the requested information. The requesting Party shall
indemnify the other Party for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such
Party in connection with providing any information or documentation pursuant
to this _Section 8.5_. Any information obtained under this _Section 8.5_
shall be kept confidential, except as otherwise reasonably may be necessary in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in
conducting any Tax audit, dispute or contest.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Tax Agency Agreements_. Immediately after the Closing, Casella
will take such action as may be necessary to terminate any agreement with any
Tax Authority authorizing Casella or any Affiliate of Casella to act as an
agent on behalf of the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries with respect to
such Tax Authority and Casella will use its best efforts to have such
termination effective as of the Closing Date.

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement by Casella pursuant to
_Section 9.1(e)_, Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Casella, as
Casellas sole and exclusive remedy, a termination fee in the amount of Six
Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($6,500,000) (the " _Reverse Break-up
Fee_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Reverse Break-up Fee shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Seller Indemnitees against, Purchaser, Parent, each Sponsor, each provider of
Debt Financing or any of their respective, direct or indirect, former, current
or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates or assignees (collectively,
the " _Purchaser Related Parties_ ") for all Losses suffered as a result of
the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and
upon payment of such amount, none of the Purchaser Related Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event of the termination of
this Agreement by Casella and the payment of the Reverse Break-up Fee, the
Purchaser Related Parties shall have no liability or obligation whatsoever and
Sellers and their Affiliates shall have no remedies whatsoever; _provided_ ,
however, that the Reverse Break-up Fee shall only be payable in accordance
with the terms of _Section 9.1(e)_ hereof; provided further, however, that no
remedy whatsoever is available to Sellers in the event that Casella terminates
this Agreement under any provision other than _Section 9.1(e)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) in no event
shall Purchaser or any Sponsor pursuant to any Sponsor Guaranty, be subject to
(nor shall Sellers, the Company or their respective Affiliates seek to
recover) monetary damages in excess of any amount agreed to in a Sponsor
Guaranty executed by such Sponsor and (ii) no personal

 



      
 

 



 

liability whatsoever will attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by
any former, current or future director, officer, agent or employee of
Purchaser, any Sponsor, provider of Debt Financing or their respective
Affiliates, nor any former, current or future direct or indirect holder of any
equity interests or securities of Purchaser, any Sponsor, any provider of Debt
Financing or their respective Affiliates (whether such holder is a limited or
general partner, member, stockholder or otherwise), nor any Affiliate of
Purchaser or any Sponsor, nor any Affiliate of any provider of Debt Financing,
or of any direct or indirect director, officer, employee, partner, Affiliate,
member, controlling person or representative of any of the foregoing whether
by the enforcement of any judgment or assessment or by any legal or equitable
proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable Law.
The Reverse Break-up Fee payable pursuant to this _Section 9.2(a)_ shall be
paid by wire transfer of same-day funds within three (3) Business days after
the demand therefor, which demand may only be made following the occurrence of
the termination event giving rise to the payment obligation described in this
_Section 9.2(a)_.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Casellas
right to receive payment of the Reverse Break-up Fee from Purchaser pursuant
to the first sentence of _Section 9.2(a)_ or from the Sponsors pursuant to
the Sponsor Guarantees shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and Casellas
and any other Seller Indemnitees sole and exclusive remedy for any and all
Losses suffered or incurred by Casella or any other Person in connection with
this Agreement (and the termination of this Agreement), the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination, and upon payment of such amount
neither Casella nor any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain
any other claim, action or proceeding against Purchaser, any Sponsor, provider
of Debt Financing or any of their respective Affiliates or future Affiliates
and assigns, nor any former, current or future direct or indirect holder of
any equity interests or securities of Purchaser, any Sponsor, provider of Debt
Financing or their respective Affiliates (whether such holder is a limited or
general partner, member, stockholder or otherwise), arising out of this
Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated this Agreement or any matters
forming the basis for such termination. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, if a court of competent jurisdiction has ordered Purchaser to pay
the Reverse Break-up Fee, Casella shall not be entitled to enforce such order
if (i) Purchaser delivers to Casella, within three (3) Business Days following
the issuance of such order, a notice electing to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with _Articles_ _II_ and _III_ of
this Agreement and (ii) the Closing occurs within three (3) Business Days
following the delivery of such notice.

 



 

(c) (i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser pursuant
to _Section 9.1(d_) as a result of the failure of Sellers to perform the
covenants and obligations in _Section 6.3(b)_ in all material respects
assuming that the "exception" parenthetical in the lead-in language to
_Section 6.3(b_) does not exist, Casella shall reimburse Purchaser for its
Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement in an amount not to exceed
$6.5 million (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ "); provided that Purchaser has
not failed to perform its covenants and obligations under _Sections 6.20_ and
_6.21_ in all material respects. (ii) In the event that Purchaser has notified
Sellers on or prior to February 28, 2011 that Purchaser is then ready, willing
and able to Close (subject to the satisfaction of any remaining conditions
within the control of Sellers) or that Purchaser has ceased efforts to Close
prior to such time based on receipt of written notification from Sellers that
the condition set forth in _Section 7.3(d)_ could not be satisfied on or
prior to February 28, 2011, and Sellers are, at any time thereafter, unwilling
to

 



      
 

 



 

Close on account of the failure of the condition in _Section 7.3(d)_ to be
satisfied, then upon the termination of this Agreement by Purchaser in
accordance with _Section 9.1_, Casella shall pay Purchaser liquidated damages
equal to $6.5 million (the " _Lender Waiver Damages_ "). In each case, in the
event that Purchaser shall receive full payment of the Expense Reimbursement
or the Lender Waiver Damages, as applicable, the receipt of such payment shall
be deemed to be liquidated damages and Purchasers sole and exclusive remedy
for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Purchaser or any
other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination of this
Agreement), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and
neither Purchaser nor any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain
any other claim, action or proceeding against Casella or any of its Affiliates
arising out of this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated this
Agreement or any matters forming the basis for such termination. For purposes
of this _Section 9.2(c)_, "ready, willing and able to Close" shall not be
interpreted to require that Purchasers funding sources shall have funded any
amount of the Initial Purchase Price or Final Purchase Price. Upon the written
request of Purchaser, Sellers shall respond within two (2) Business Days as to
whether the bank consent is in effect.

 



 

(d) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
9.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement.

 



 

(e) Except as set forth in _Sections 9.2(a)_ and _9.2(b)_ , termination of
this Agreement shall not relieve any Party for any breach by such Party, prior
to the termination of this Agreement, of any covenant or agreement (but not
any representation or warranty) contained in this Agreement or impair the
right of any Party to obtain such remedies as may be available to it in Law or
equity with respect to such a breach by any other Party.

(a) any failure of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser in this

For the avoidance of doubt, Purchasers obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless Seller Indemnitees pursuant to clauses (b) and (c) of the immediately

Section 10.4 _Limitation on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 10.4(b)_, (i) neither Sellers nor Purchaser, as the
case may be, shall be liable for any claim for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 10.2(a)_ or _Section 10.3(a)_, as the case may be, unless and until
the aggregate amount of Losses which may be recovered from Sellers or
Purchaser, as the case may be equals or exceeds One Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000) (the " _Basket_ "), in which case Sellers or
Purchaser, as the case may be, shall be liable for all indemnifiable Losses
incurred by Sellers or Purchaser, respectively, and not just the amount that
exceeds the Basket and (ii) neither Sellers nor Purchaser, as the case may be,
shall be liable for an aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses arising from
claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ or _Section
10.3(a)_ as the case may be, in excess of Fifteen Million Dollars
($15,000,000).

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the limitations set forth
in Section 10.4(a) shall not apply to Losses incurred by (i) any Purchaser
Indemnitee in connection with or arising from any breach of any representation
or warranty in _Section 4.2(a)_ (Authorization), _Section 4.3_ (Ownership of
Equity Interests), _Section 4.5_ (Capitalization), _Section 4.14_ (Tax
Matters) or _Section 4.16_ (Brokers or Finders Fee) and (ii) any Seller
Indemnitee in connection with or arising from any breach of any representation
or warranty of Purchaser in _Section 5.2(a)_ (Authorization) or _Section
5.4_ (Brokers or Finders Fee).

 



 

Section 10.5 _Losses Net of Insurance_. The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under _Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.3_ shall be
net of (i) any specific accruals or reserves on the Financial Statements
referenced in _Section 4.7(a)_, (ii) any amount for which a reserve or
accrual is included in final Closing Working Capital or which has otherwise
been taken into account as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price pursuant
to the definition thereof for purposes of the calculation of the Final
Purchase Price, (iii) any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party (net of
any Taxes and costs of investigation of the underlying claim and of
collection) pursuant to any indemnification by or indemnification agreement
with any Person (other than this Agreement) and (iv) any insurance proceeds
(net of any Taxes and any costs of investigation of the underlying claim and
of collection) received as an offset against such Loss (each source of
recovery referred to in clauses (iii) and (iv), a " _Collateral Source_ "). If
the amount to be netted hereunder in connection with a Collateral Source from
any payment required under _Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.3_ is received
after payment by the Indemnifying Party of any amount otherwise required to be
paid to an Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article X_, the Indemnified
Party shall repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such receipt, any
amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this
_Article X_ had such receipt occurred at the time of such payment. In the
event that Purchaser makes a claim against Sellers for indemnification
pursuant to this _Article X_ and the subject matter of such indemnification
claim relates to the potential liability of a Collateral Source from which
Purchaser may have otherwise asserted a claim for Losses, Purchaser shall, at
Sellers request and expense following the full satisfaction by Sellers of
their obligations under this _Article X_, subrogate its rights to such claim
in favor of Sellers and assign all of its rights in respect of such claim to
Sellers. Each Indemnified Party shall take commercially reasonable steps to
mitigate any Losses as soon as reasonably practicable after such Indemnified
Party becomes aware of any event which does, or could reasonably be expected
to, give rise to any such Losses. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary, Purchaser, the Sponsors and/or any Lender or arranger under the Debt
Commitment Letters or any other source of Debt Financing and their respective
Affiliates shall not be liable for or obligated to pay consequential, special,
multiple,

 



      
 

 



 

punitive or exemplary damages, including damages arising from loss of profits,
business opportunities or goodwill in respect of any breach or failure to
comply with this Agreement or any transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Financings) or any damages, limited to each Sponsors pro rata share with
regard to Sponsors obligations, in excess of the Reverse Break-Up Fee.

 



 

Section 10.6 _Indemnification Procedure_.

 



 

(a) Promptly after the incurrence of any Losses by any Person entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.4_, _Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.3_
(an " _Indemnified Party_ "), including, any claim by a Person described in
_Section 10.7_, which might give rise to indemnification hereunder, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Party from which indemnification is
sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") a certificate (a " _Claim Certificate_
"), which Claim Certificate shall:

 



 

(i) state that the Indemnified Party has paid or anticipates it will incur
liability for Losses for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement; and

 



 

(ii) specify (and have annexed thereto all supporting documentation, including
any correspondence in connection with any Third-Party Claim and paid invoices,
if any, for claimed Losses) each individual item of Loss included in the
amount so stated, the date such item was paid (if paid), the basis for any
anticipated liability and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of
warranty, breach of covenant or claim to which each such item is related and
the computation of the amount to which such Indemnified Party claims to be
entitled hereunder.

 



 

The Indemnified Party making the claim shall state only what is required in
subsections (i) \- (ii) above and shall not be deemed to admit or deny the
validity of the facts or circumstances out of which such claim arose.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall object to the
indemnification of an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim or claims
specified in any Claim Certificate, the Indemnifying Party shall, within
thirty (30) days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such Claim
Certificate, deliver to the Indemnified Party a notice to such effect,
specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such objection, and the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall, within the sixty (60) day
period beginning on the date of receipt by the Indemnified Party of such
objection, attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to each of such claims to which the Indemnifying Party
shall have so objected. If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall succeed in reaching agreement on their respective rights with respect to
any of such claims, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
promptly prepare and sign a memorandum of agreement setting forth such
agreement. Should the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party be unable
to agree as to any particular item or items or amount or amounts within such
time period, then the Indemnified Party shall be permitted to submit such
dispute as set forth in _Section 11.9_. The Party which receives a final
judgment in such dispute shall be indemnified and held harmless for all
reasonable attorney and consultants fees or expenses by the other Party.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) Claims for Losses specified in any Claim Certificate to which an
Indemnifying Party shall not object in writing within thirty (30) days of
receipt of such Claim Certificate, claims for Losses covered by a memorandum
of agreement of the nature described in _Section 10.6(b)_, and claims for
Losses the validity and amount of which have been the subject of determination
pursuant to _Section 11.9_ as described in _Section 10.6(b)_ or shall have
been settled with the consent of the Indemnifying Party, as described in
_Section 10.7_, are hereinafter referred to, collectively, as " _Agreed
Claims_ ". Within five (5) Business Days of the determination of the amount of
any Agreed Claims (or at such other time as the Indemnified Party and
Indemnifying Party shall agree), the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the
Indemnified Party an amount equal to the Agreed Claim by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to the bank account or accounts designated by the
Indemnified Party in a notice to the Indemnifying Party not less than two (2)
Business Days prior to such payment.

 



 

Section 10.7 _Third-Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) If a claim by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") is made against
any Indemnified Party, and if such party intends to seek indemnity with
respect thereto under this _Article X_, such Indemnified Party shall promptly
notify the Indemnifying Party of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that the
failure to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually and materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have
ten (10) days after receipt of such notice to assume the conduct and control,
through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party at the expense
of the Indemnifying Party, of the settlement or defense of such Third Party
Claim and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with it in connection
therewith; _provided_ , that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall permit the
Indemnified Party to participate in such settlement or defense through counsel
chosen by such Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that, subject to _Section
10.7.(b)_, the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such
Indemnified Party, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume
the defense of such action only to the extent the Indemnifying Party
acknowledges in writing its indemnity obligation to the extent set forth in
this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall
not be entitled to assume control of such defense and shall pay the fees and
expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if (A) such Third Party
Claim may reasonably give rise to Losses which are more than 200% of the
amount indemnifiable by such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Article X_;
(B) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (C) the
claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party;
(D) the Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by counsel that a
reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party; or (E) upon petition by the
Indemnified Party, the appropriate court rules that the Indemnifying Party
failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such Third Party Claim;
or (F) if the defendant in such Third Party Claim is Pegasus Capital Advisors,
L.P. or its members, managers, officers or directors, such Indemnified Party
reasonably believes an adverse determination with respect to the action,
lawsuit, investigation, proceeding or other claim giving rise to such claim
for indemnification would be detrimental to or injure such Indemnified Partys
reputation.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any Indemnified Party shall have
the right to employ separate counsel in any such action or claim and to
participate in the defense of

 



      
 

 



 

such Third Party Claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall not be
at the expense of the Indemnifying Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party
shall have failed, or is not entitled, to assume the defense of such Third
Party Claim in accordance with _Section 10.7(a)_, (ii) the employment of such
counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party,
which authorization shall not be unreasonably withheld, or (iii) the named
parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party shall
have been advised in writing by such counsel that there may be one (1) or more
legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are not available to
the Indemnifying Party, or available to the Indemnifying Party the assertion
of which would be adverse to the interests of the Indemnified Party. So long
as the Indemnifying Party is reasonably contesting any such Third Party Claim
in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such Third
Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to pay or settle any such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that in
such event it shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by the Indemnifying
Party for such Third Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Party shall have
consented to such payment or settlement.

 



 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within ten
(10) days after the receipt of the Indemnified Partys notice of a Third Party
Claim of indemnity hereunder that it elects to undertake the defense thereof,
the Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise
the Third Party Claim but shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity
therefor pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(d) The Indemnifying Party shall not, except with the consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), enter into any settlement that is not entirely indemnifiable by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Article X_ and does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the Person or Persons asserting such
Third Party Claim to all Indemnified Parties of an unconditional release from
all liability with respect to such Third Party Claim or consent to entry of
any judgment.

 



 

(e) The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with each
other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third
Party Claim, including making available records relating to such Third Party
Claim (subject to the terms of a joint defense agreement if deemed advisable
by the Indemnifying Party) and furnishing, without expense to the Indemnifying
Party and/or its counsel, such employees of the Indemnified Party as may be
reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of any such Third
Party Claim or for testimony as witnesses in any proceeding relating to such
Third Party Claim.

 



 

(f) In the case of a Third Party Claim that is also a Tax Matter, to the
extent that anything in this _Section 10.7_ is contrary to the provisions in
_Article VIII_, _Article VIII_ shall govern.

 



 

Section 10.8 _Sole Remedy/Waiver_. Except as otherwise provided herein, or in
the case of fraud, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, in the event that
the Closing occurs, the remedies provided for in _Section 8.4_ and this
_Article X_ shall be the Parties sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of
the representations and warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement or
any claims relating to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
in

 



      
 

 



 

this _Section 10.8_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prevent any Party
from receiving the full amount of the Initial Purchase Price or of any
Purchase Price Adjustment in accordance with _Section 3.2_ hereof.

 



 

Section 10.9 _Sellers  Waiver_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Casella hereby waives and acknowledges that it shall not
exercise or assert, any right of contribution or right to indemnity or any
other right or remedy against the Companies or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with any indemnification obligation or any other
Liability to which Casella or any of its Subsidiaries may become subject under
this Agreement or otherwise in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated herein.

such assistance and information, including but not limited to environmental
investigations, reports, assessments and remedial work plans, all relevant
correspondence to or received from any Governmental Entity, and access to each
of the facilities identified in _Section 10.2(f)_, that is necessary or
appropriate for Sellers to fulfill their obligations under _Section 10.2(f)_.

Section 11.9 _Required Dispute Resolution Process_. Any dispute, controversy,
claim or disagreement between the Parties arising from, relating to or in
connection with this Agreement (each a " _Dispute_ "), shall be resolved in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 11.9_; provided, that to the
extent such Dispute is in excess of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), upon
the request by a Party, such Dispute shall be resolved in accordance with
_Section 11.10_ and this _Section 11.9_ shall not apply.

 



 

(a) Any Dispute shall be considered in person or by telephone by the
designated dispute resolution representatives of each Party (who shall be
persons with authority to resolve such Dispute) (each, such Partys " _DR
Representative_ ") within seven (7) Business Days of receipt of a written
notice from any Party confirming the existence of a Dispute under this
_Section 11.9_ and specifying the nature of such Dispute. The DR
Representatives shall meet as often as the Parties deem reasonably necessary
to gather and furnish to each other all information with respect to the
Dispute in issue which is appropriate and germane in connection with its

 



      
 

 



 

resolution. The DR Representatives shall discuss the problem and negotiate in
good faith in an effort to resolve the Dispute.

 



 

(b) Any Dispute that has not been resolved within thirty (30) days of the
first meeting or telephone conference of the DR Representatives shall, upon
written notice given by any Party to the other Parties, be submitted to
mediation. The Parties will jointly appoint a mutually acceptable mediator,
and if they cannot agree upon such a mediator within fifteen (15) days after
the written notice submitting the Dispute to mediation, the American
Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ ") shall appoint the mediator. The Parties
agree to participate in good faith in the mediation and negotiations related
thereto for a period of thirty (30) days commencing with the appointment of
the mediator and any extension of such period as mutually agreed to by the
Parties. Each Party shall bear its own costs relating to such mediation, and
the Parties shall share equally the mediators fees and expenses.

 



 

(c) If the Dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days after the
appointment of the mediator (or any extension of such period as mutually
agreed to by the Parties), the Dispute shall be submitted to, and finally
determined by, binding arbitration administered by the AAA in accordance with
its Commercial Arbitration Rules. There shall be a single arbitrator, to be
appointed by mutual agreement of the Parties or, if the Parties cannot agree
within thirty (30) days after the demand for arbitration, to be appointed by
the AAA (the " _DR Arbitrator_ "), and such DR Arbitrator shall be an attorney
having experience and familiarity with commercial contract disputes. The place
of arbitration shall be New York, New York, and the arbitration shall be
conducted in English (with the use of translators as and when necessary). Each
Party shall bear its own costs relating to such arbitration and all related
proceedings. Judgment upon the award rendered by the DR Arbitrator may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. This arbitration agreement
shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the
Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Section 1 et seq. Each Party shall continue
to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and this
Agreement shall remain in effect while the Dispute is being resolved.

 



 

(d) Nothing in this _Section 11.9_ shall prevent any Party from (i)
exercising any of such Partys rights or remedies granted under this
Agreement; or (ii) pursuing judicial remedies in aid of arbitration (including
applications to compel arbitration) to stay judicial proceedings pending
arbitration, or interlocutory, interim or provisional orders of injunction,
replevin, attachments or other measures that may be necessary to prevent
injury to a Party pending the appointment of the DR Arbitrator or pending the
DR Arbitrators determination of the merits of the Dispute. Each Party
irrevocably consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York in connection with
any action permitted under this _Section 11.9_.

 



 

(e) With respect to action, disputes or claims of less than Five Million
Dollars ($5,000,000), each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring

Federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and appellate courts thereof).

 



 

Section 11.11 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
contained in this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory
policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions
contained in this Agreement shall remain in valid and binding and shall in no
way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and this Agreement shall be

 ** _COMMODITIES MARKETING AND BROKERAGE AGREEMENT_**

 



 

This **COMMODITIES MARKETING AND BROKERAGE AGREEMENT** (this " _Agreement_ ")
is made and entered into this 28th day of February, 2011 (the " _Effective
Date_ "), by and between (i) Casella Waste Systems, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), and (ii) RE Community Holdings II, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (f/k/a CE Holdings II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company) (the " _Broker_ "). The parties hereto may be referred to herein
individually as a " _Party_ ", or collectively as the " _Parties_ ".

 



 

 ** _RECITALS:_**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Company and the Broker are parties to a Purchase and Sale
Agreement (the " _Purchase Agreement_ ") dated as of January 23, 2011,
pursuant to which the Company will transfer to the Broker all rights and title
to FCR, LLC and its subsidiaries;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Companys willingness to enter into the Purchase Agreement
and to consummate each of the transactions contemplated thereunder is
contingent upon, subject to and in reliance on the services provided by the
Broker hereunder (the " _Services_ "), including the brokerage services and
the risk management services, and the Company would not have entered into the
Purchase Agreement but for the commitments, obligations, and other agreements
of the Broker as set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , in connection with the operation of the Companys business at
the Companys and its affiliates Charlestown and Auburn, Massachusetts and
Ontario, New York facilities (the " _Recycling Facilities_ "), the Company and
its affiliates receive certain Recyclable Materials, which they process into
salable or reusable commodities for marketing and/or sale (any such
commodities as produced in the Recycling Facilities, and only in the Recycling
Facilities, including Engineered Feedstock, the " _Products_ "; for the
avoidance of doubt, Products do not include any Baled Residue);

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Company desires that the Broker act as its exclusive broker
during the Term with respect to the Marketing and Sales of the Products from
the Recycling Facilities;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Broker is willing, desirous of and possesses the necessary
marketing and sales expertise, experience, relationships, market knowledge and
capabilities, to secure the sale or movement of the Products upon beneficial
pricing and other contractual terms.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the premises and of the mutual
covenants, representations, warranties and agreements herein contained, the
Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

      
 

 



 

SECTION 1. _DEFINITIONS_.

 



 

When used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the respective
meanings specified therefor below.

is a fossil fuel substitution for combustion, and (c) which is used in a
biological, thermal or chemical conversion process to produce electricity,
heat, gaseous fuels, liquid fuels, and chemicals. Engineered Feedstock
includes uses of source separated organic portions of municipal solid waste
when mixed with municipal solid waste and used as described in subsections (b)
and (c) of the preceding sentence, but specifically excludes the use of source
separated organics if not mixed with municipal solid waste which are then used
in a biological, thermal or chemical conversion process.

 



 

" _Marketing and Sales_ " shall mean the services provided by the Broker to
identify and solicit users of the Products and the coordination of the sale of
these Products.

 



 

" _WTE Baled Residue Cap_ " shall mean, for any calendar month, nine percent
(9%) of the aggregate volume, in tons, of Products and Baled Residue sent from
the Recycling Facilities during such month.

 



 

SECTION 2. _DUTIES OF THE BROKER_.

 



 

2.1 Appointment; Efforts.

 



 

(a) The Company hereby appoints the Broker as its exclusive sales broker for
the Marketing and Sales of the Products from the Recycling Facilities during
the Term, and the Broker hereby accepts such appointment on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement. At the Companys request from time to
time, the Broker shall also act as sales broker pursuant to the terms hereof
for the Marketing and Sales of recycled materials produced at the Companys
facilities other than the Recycling Facilities (and upon mutually agreeable
pricing terms); _provided_ , that the Company shall have no obligations under
this Agreement in respect of any recyclable materials derived

      
 

 



 

from its other currently owned or operated facilities or facilities that the
Company may own or operate in the future; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ ,
that if the Company voluntarily moves Product currently being processed at any
Recycling Facility to a Company facility that is not a Recycling Facility, the
moved Product shall remain subject to the Companys payment obligation to the
Broker under Section 3 to the extent the moved Product has not been replaced.
The Company shall provide the Broker with weekly reports of its inventory of
Products to be offered for sale pursuant to this Agreement. The Broker shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to promote, solicit orders for and
procure orders for the Products FOB applicable Recycling Facility, or FOB
buyers location in the case of glass materials or shipments to export
shipment piers, and shall in all instances act in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable Laws. The Broker may engage subcontractors from
time to time to perform all or any portion of the Services, subject to the
prior written approval of the Company.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing _Section 2.1(a)_, the Company shall have
the right to market and sell any or all of the Products on its own behalf
(i.e., without utilizing any other broker, other than export brokers, to
provide the services otherwise being provided by the Broker hereunder), (i) if
in good faith it believes that the price it can obtain for Products so
marketed and sold by it exceeds the gross price (net of transportation costs
but prior to deduction for the payment pursuant to _Section 2_ below) it
expects to have received if such Products had been marketed and sold hereunder
by the Broker, or (ii) if in good faith it determines that for overall
relationship purposes it is important to supply the Products to one or more
customers other than the customer(s) identified by the Broker, unless in any
such case such volumes of Product are under a contract as listed on Schedule 1
attached hereto (the " _Contracted Volumes_ "), which Contracted Volumes will
not be subject to the Companys rights under this _Section 2.1(b)_). Any
Product shipped by the Company pursuant to this _Section 2.1(b)_ shall remain
subject to the Companys payment obligation to the Broker under _Section 3_.
The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the quality
standards and obligations for the Contracted Volumes.

 



 

(c) The Brokers services hereunder shall include informing the Company as to
available and applicable risk mitigation strategies (including without
limitation agreements such as hedge agreements, floor price contracts and
forward price contracts, etc.) relating to the Products. Such services shall
include, at the Companys request, (i) presenting the Company with the same
risk management contract opportunities, such as hedge agreements, floor price
contracts and forward price contracts, etc., as are available to the Broker
for its (or its affiliates) own comparable products, each upon such terms and
conditions as are mutually agreed and which shall be the rights and
obligations of the parties thereto separate from the terms and obligations of
this Agreement, including, without limitation, obligations and rights related
to the Services and Brokerage Fees; or (ii) identifying for and presenting to
the Company hedging arrangements that match the specific parameters requested
by the Company (i.e., regardless of whether the Broker has procured comparable
contracts for its own products), subject to the establishment by the Company,
at its cost, of financial assurances required by the counterparty to any such
hedging arrangement; _provided_ ,

      
 

 



 

 _however_ , that nothing herein shall preclude the Company from procuring and
entering into risk management strategies identified and chosen without the
assistance of the Broker. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Broker makes no representations or warranties of any kind regarding the
Companys eligibility for or ability to enter into any such risk mitigation
strategy, and shall not be required to assume any obligation or liability in
connection with any such arrangements.

 



 

2.2 Product Sales; Authority.

 



 

(a) Except as may otherwise be agreed by the Company and the Broker in writing
in the context of any specific sale, all Product shipments shall be executed
and managed directly between the Company and the applicable customer, FOB
applicable Recycling Facility or delivery locations pursuant to the applicable
purchase order (such as glass shipments or shipments to export shipping
piers). All payments or charges for the Products shall be made directly to the
Company from, or by the Company to, the customer, except that all hedge
agreement payments or charges shall be made directly between the Company and
the appropriate counterparty. The Broker shall promptly transmit to the
Company all offers or orders received by it for the Products. The Broker shall
provide all reasonable sales support to the Companys customers in a manner
that is consistent with standard and customary industry practices.

 



 

(b) The Broker shall have no authority or power to (a) collect funds or accept
payment of any invoices issued by the Company, (b) act for or to conclude
contracts on behalf of or in the name of the Company or (c) create any
liability of the Company or to otherwise bind the Company in any way or for
any purpose. For the avoidance of doubt, all customers will be invoiced by the
Company and all payments or charges will be made directly by the customer to
the Company or by the Company to the customer, as applicable, except that all
hedge agreement payments or charges shall be made directly between the Company
and the appropriate counterparty.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
and Broker shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause
customers under the contracts listed on Schedule 1 to accept invoices directly
from the Company for all deliveries made by the Company with respect to any
recyclable materials shipped from a Company owned or operated facility. If and
to the extent Broker shall receive any payments that are payable to the
Company from customers in respect of such recyclable materials, (i) Broker
shall promptly remit all such payments to the Company, and (ii) the Company
shall pay to Broker (if not already paid) all Brokerage Fees in respect of
such recyclable materials in accordance with Section 3 hereof. The Companys
obligations to supply Contracted Volumes pursuant to any contract listed on
Schedule 1 shall terminate upon the expiration of the current term of such
contract. The Company agrees that in connection with such invoicing activities
it shall take no action reasonably expected to adversely affect the Brokers
relationship with such customers; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not
affect the Companys right to enforce its rights and remedies in connection
with the deliveries under the listed contracts, including the right to
initiate collection actions for payments due; _provided_ , that as a condition
to enforcing

      
 

 



 

any such rights, the Company shall provide Broker with at least three (3)
business days prior written notice describing the action or actions sought to
be taken.

 



 

2.3 Company Instructions. The Broker shall at all times comply in all material
respects with any standing general instructions or specific instructions which
may be given by the Company on a case-by-case basis regarding the information
that the Broker may convey to a particular customer with regard to the
Products, including, among other things, payment, delivery and other terms and
conditions.

 



 

2.4 Books and Records; Audit Right.

 



 

(a) The Broker shall maintain complete and accurate records concerning all
reasonable offers, orders and customer information relating to the Products
and shall provide to the Company:

 



 

(i) on a monthly basis, a forecast of its expected sales (together with
information on pricing and allocation) and reports on its strategies and
activities related to the Products;

 



 

(ii) on a quarterly basis, a review and assessment of customer lists related
to the Products; and

 



 

(iii) a list of mills with open purchase orders for the following month for

(ii) a list of the Products inventory and all the Products shipped from the
Recycling Facilities for the previous month.

 



 

(c) The Broker shall afford the officers, accountants and other authorized
representatives of the Company access upon reasonable notice and during normal
business hours to such records, management and offices of the Broker as may be
directly related to the sale of the Products following the date of this
Agreement and the Brokers performance of its obligations under this
Agreement; _provided_ , that such access shall not unreasonably disrupt the
operations of the Broker.

 



 

(d) The Company shall afford the officers, accountants and other authorized
representatives of the Broker access upon reasonable notice and during normal
business hours to such records, management and offices of the Company as may
be directly related to the sale of the Products following the date of this
Agreement and the Companys performance of its obligations under this
Agreement; _provided_ , that such access shall not include any right to review
customer specific information related to

      
 

 



 

inbound volumes of Recyclable Materials, or unreasonably disrupt the
operations of the Company.

 



 

SECTION 3. _PAYMENT_.

 



 

Within ten (10) days following the end of each calendar month, the Company
shall (a) deliver a statement (the "Shipment Statement") to the Broker
detailing the amounts of all Products shipped during such month from a
Recycling Facility or from a warehouse used by the Company to store any
Product prior to shipment to a customer and (b) within thirty (30) days of the
delivery of the Shipment Statement pay to the Broker an amount in cash equal
to [**] Dollars ($[**]) for each ton so shipped (the "Brokerage Fee"), net of
any tonnage discrepancies (as calculated based upon the applicable Facilitys
tonnage scale or scales, or, where provided in an applicable purchase order,
the customers scale or scales).

 



 

SECTION 4. _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_.

 



 

4.1 Each Party individually represents and warrants to the other Party that:

(b) The Broker agrees that it shall not make any representations or warranties

Effective Date (such ten-year period, the "Term"), unless earlier terminated
in accordance with this Section 5. This Agreement may be renewed upon mutual
agreement between the Parties following the expiration of the Term.

 



 

5.2 Termination.

 



 

(a) This Agreement may be terminated

 



 

(i) at any time upon mutual written agreement of the Parties or in accordance
with _Section 5.3(c)_; or

 



 

(ii) immediately by a Party fifteen (15) days following the delivery of
written notice to the other Party in the event that any of the other Partys
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement are shown to be
materially untrue or incorrect (an " _Inaccuracy_ "), which Inaccuracy is not
cured within such fifteen (15) day period; _provided_ , that such fifteen (15)
day cure period may be extended by such non-defaulting Party in its sole
discretion; or

 



 

(iii) immediately by a non-defaulting Party fifteen (15) days following the
delivery of a written notice to the other Party in the event of a failure by
the

      
 

 



 

other Party to materially perform a material obligation of such other Party
under the terms of this Agreement (a " _Default_ "), which Default is not
cured within such fifteen (15) day period; _provided_ , that such fifteen (15)
day cure period may be extended by such non-defaulting Party in its sole
discretion; and

 



 

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may terminate this Agreement
at any time after the first anniversary of the Effective Date upon the
provision of at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Broker.
Such termination shall be contingent on the payment by the Company to the
Broker of a termination payment (the " _Termination Payment_ ") in an amount
equal to Five Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($5,600,000) less the sum
of all Prior Year Payments that occurred prior to the year in which the
Termination Payment is calculated. As used herein, a "Prior Year Payment" for
a given year shall mean the lesser of (i) all amounts paid by the Company to
the Broker hereunder on account of such year or (ii) $500,000, with the first
Prior Year Payment calculated for the 12 month period prior to the first
anniversary of the Effective Date and each subsequent Prior Year Payment
calculated for each 12 month period following the first anniversary of the
Effective Date until the date this Agreement expires or is terminated.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Company sells any
Recycling Facility, (A) the acquirer must assume in writing all of the
obligations of the Company hereunder with respect to such sold Recycling
Facility; _provided_ that, to the extent such obligations are not so assumed
and paid by such acquirer, the Company shall remain liable for such
obligations based on deemed monthly volumes from such sold Recycling Facility
equal to the average monthly volume calculated over the twelve full calendar
months preceding such sale; or (B) such sale shall be deemed a termination of
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 5.2(a)(iv)_ and the Company shall be
required to pay the Termination Payment calculated as of the date of such
sale.

 



 

The termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ shall not
prejudice the rights of any Party accrued hereunder up to and including the
date of termination, and shall not affect any rights or obligations hereunder
which are specified in this Agreement to survive, or by their nature are to
survive, such termination. Following any such termination, the Broker shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell any unsold Products pursuant
to the terms hereof which were reported by the Company to the Broker prior to
the date of termination as available for sale and for which the Company
reaffirms in writing its obligation to pay the Brokerage Fee for any such
Products that are sold. The provisions of _Section 6_, and the Brokers
indemnification obligations set forth in _Section 7.1_ shall survive any
termination of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Broker shall
have no obligations or liabilities related to any contracts for Products
entered into by the Company and its customers pursuant to this Agreement; such
contracts shall not be affected by the termination of this Agreement and shall
continue to survive pursuant to the terms thereof.

 



 

5.3 Force Majeure.

 



 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement: " _Force Majeure_ " shall mean any act,
event or condition materially and adversely affecting the ability of a Party
to perform

      
 

 



 

or comply with any material obligation, duty or agreement required of such
Party under this Agreement, if such act, event, or condition is beyond the
reasonable control of the nonperforming Party or its agents relying thereon;
is not the result of the willful or negligent action, inaction or fault of the
Party relying thereon; and the nonperforming Party has been unable to avoid or
overcome the act, event or condition by the exercise of due diligence,
including, without limitation: (i) an act of God, epidemic, landslide,
lightning, earthquake, fire, explosion, storm, flood or similar occurrence;
(ii) an act of a public enemy, war, blockage, insurrection, riot, general
unrest or restraint of government and people, civil disturbance or
disobedience, sabotage, act of terrorism or similar occurrence; (iii) a
strike, contracted customer mill closure, work slowdown, or similar industrial
or labor action; (iv) an order or judgment (including without limitation a
temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, preliminary injunction,
permanent injunction, or cease and desist order) or other act of any federal,
state, county or local court, administrative agency or governmental office or
body which prevents the performance of a Partys obligations as contemplated
by this Agreement; or (v) adoption or change (including a change in
interpretation, enforcement or permit requirement) of any Law after the
Effective Date preventing performance of or compliance with the obligations
hereunder.

 



 

(b) Neither Party shall be liable to the other for Losses if such Partys
performance is delayed or prevented due to an event of Force Majeure;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such Force Majeure shall not excuse either Party
from performing its payment obligations under this Agreement except to the
extent that the inability to make such payment is itself Force Majeure. In the
event of a Force Majeure, the affected Party shall promptly notify the other
Party of the event of Force Majeure and its likely duration. During the
continuation of the Force Majeure event, the nonperforming Party shall (i)
exercise commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or limit Losses to the
performing Party; (ii) exercise commercially reasonable due diligence to
overcome the Force Majeure event; (iii) to the extent it is able, continue to
perform its obligations under this Agreement; and (iv) cause the suspension of
performance to be of no greater scope and no longer duration than the Force
Majeure event requires.

 



 

(c) In the event of a delay in either Partys performance of its obligation
hereunder for more than sixty (60) days due to a Force Majeure, the other
Party may, at any time thereafter, terminate this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 6. _CONFIDENTIALITY_.

 



 

6.1 Generally. This Section 6 shall survive the expiration or termination of
this Agreement or the Services for a period of two (2) years following any
such expiration or termination, and shall apply to the Parties and to all
agents, directors, managers, employees, subcontractors, officers, attorneys,
consultants, advisors or other persons acting on behalf of the Parties
(together, the "Representatives"). The terms and provisions of this Agreement,
all communications between the Parties, in whole or in part, and all
information developed by or received by either Party in connection with the
Parties performances under this Agreement and the Services (including
communications

      
 

 



 

heretofore) (the "Confidential Information") are confidential and shall be
treated as confidential by the Parties.

 



 

6.2 Receipt of Information. Each Party agrees that any "Confidential
Information" (as defined below) received from the other Party or generated in
whole or in part thereon, with regard to the Services after the Effective
Date, shall be and remain the property of the disclosing Party, and that the
receiving Party and its Representatives shall not have any right or license
thereto, and the receiving Party and its Representatives shall not disclose
the Confidential Information or use it for any purpose other than in
furtherance of the purposes of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Confidential Information" shall include all records in any form, in whole or
in part, including without limitation reports, statements, examinations,
memoranda, opinions, folders, files, books, manuals, pamphlets, forms, papers,
designs, drawings, maps, photos, letters, notes, journals, notebooks,
microfilms, computer tapes, portable drives or discs or any other electronic
storage media, e-mail, or electronic files. Without limiting the foregoing,
all data relating to the Recycling Facilities and the Products, including the
quantity, mix, pricing and purchaser thereof, shall be and remain the property
of the Company. "Confidential Information" shall not include information
which: (i) was rightfully in the possession of, or demonstrably known by, the
receiving Party prior to its receipt from the disclosing Party; (ii) is in the
public domain at the time of disclosure, not as a result of any inaction or
action of the receiving Party; (iii) is approved for release by the disclosing
Party in writing prior to the disclosure; or (iv) is independently developed
by the receiving Party without reliance on or use of any Confidential
Information.

 



 

6.3 Required Disclosure. If the receiving Party or any of its Representatives
are requested or required to disclose (after the receiving Party has used its
commercially reasonable efforts to avoid such disclosure and after promptly
advising and consulting with the disclosing Party about the receiving Partys
intention to make, and the proposed contents of, such disclosure) any of the
Confidential Information (whether by deposition, interrogatory, request for
documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process), the
receiving Party shall, or shall cause such Representative to, provide the
disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such request so that the
disclosing Party, at its sole cost and discretion, may seek an appropriate
protective order or other appropriate remedy. At any time that such protective
order or remedy has not been obtained, the receiving Party or such
Representative may disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information
which such Party or Representative is legally required to disclose or of which
disclosure is required to avoid sanction for contempt or any similar sanction,
and the receiving Party shall exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such
Confidential Information so disclosed.

 



 

6.4 Breach. Each Party (as a receiving Party) acknowledges that a breach of
the requirements of this Section 6 may cause a disclosing Party immediate and
irreparable harm and that the damages that such disclosing Party will suffer
may be difficult or impossible to measure. Therefore, upon any actual or
impending action or circumstance which, in the disclosing Partys sole
discretion, may cause a violation of this Section 6, the disclosing Party will
be entitled to issuance of a restraining order,

       
 

 



 

preliminary and permanent injunction, without bond, restraining or enjoining
such action, and, except as otherwise may be required by Law, the receiving
Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to inform any receiving
third party of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and
request that the receiving third party not disclose such Confidential
Information. This remedy will be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any
other remedy which may otherwise be available to the disclosing Party under
this Agreement, at Law, or in equity.

 



 

6.5 Press Releases and Announcements. No Party shall issue any press release
or public announcement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
without the prior written approval of the other Party; provided, however, that
any Party may make any public disclosure it believes in good faith is required
by applicable Law, regulation or stock market rules (in which case the
disclosing Party shall use reasonable efforts to advise the other Party and
provide such Party with a copy of the proposed disclosure prior to making such
disclosure).

 



 

SECTION 7. _INDEMNIFICATION_.

 



 

7.1 Indemnification by the Broker. The Broker shall, to the fullest extent
allowed by Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its direct

losses, damages, amounts paid in settlement, interest, costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), penalties (civil, criminal or
administrative), court costs and other out-of-pocket expenses (collectively,
"Losses") incurred or suffered by any Company Indemnified Party to the extent

allowed by Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Broker, its direct and
indirect equityholders, its affiliates and their respective Representatives
(each, a "Broker Indemnified Party") from and against any and all Losses
incurred or suffered by any Broker Indemnified Party to the extent that such
Losses arise by reason of, or result from (in each case, to the extent not
waived by the Broker Indemnified Party):

      
 

 



 

(a) a material breach or material inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
of the Company contained in this Agreement;

(d) any claim by a customer based on the quality of the Products or any other
failure of the Company to perform its obligations to such customer, including
without limitation, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made
by the Company in any contract or purchase order entered into by the Company
with any customer related to the Products or any representation or warranty
made by the Broker to a customer which was authorized by the Company pursuant
to and in accordance with _Section 4.3(b)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such indemnification shall not extend to any claim for which the Broker is
required to indemnify the Company under this Agreement; or

 



 

(e) any actions taken or not taken by the Broker under this Agreement at the
Companys specific direction, except to the extent such action is one for
which the Broker is required to indemnify the Company under this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 8. _LIMITATION OF LIABILITY_.

 



 

The Parties shall not be liable for any Losses in respect of any special,
indirect, incidental, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages suffered,
asserted or alleged by either Party or any third party arising from or
relating to this Agreement or the Services, regardless of whether such damages
are claimed under contract, warranty, indemnity, tort or any other theory at
Law or in equity, except to the extent that such damages are actually paid by
a Party to a third party.

 



 

SECTION 9. _MISCELLANEOUS_.

 



 

9.1 Independent Contractor. The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that
the Broker is an independent contractor for purposes of this Agreement and is
solely responsible for all of its Representatives. Except as specifically
provided for in this Agreement, neither Party shall have any right, power or

or to act as or be an agent or representative of, or to otherwise bind, the
other Party. The Broker shall not represent itself to have any authority to
act on behalf of the Company. Furthermore, this Agreement shall not be

Representative_ ") within seven (7) Business Days of receipt of a written

(c) Any Dispute that has not been resolved within thirty (30) days of the

written notice given by any Party to the other Parties, be submitted to
mediation. The Parties will jointly appoint a mutually acceptable mediator,

appointed by mutual agreement of the Parties or, if the Parties cannot agree

proceedings. Judgment upon the award rendered by the DR Arbitrator may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. This arbitration agreement
shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the
Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Section 1 et seq. Each Party shall continue
to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and this
Agreement shall remain in effect while the Dispute is being resolved.

 



 

(e) Nothing in this _Section 9.14_ shall prevent any Party from (i)
exercising any of such Partys rights or remedies granted under this
Agreement; or (ii) pursuing judicial remedies in aid of arbitration (including
applications to compel arbitration) to stay judicial proceedings pending
arbitration, or interlocutory, interim or provisional orders of injunction,
replevin, attachments or other measures that may be necessary to prevent
injury to a Party pending the appointment of the DR Arbitrator or pending the
DR Arbitrators determination of the merits of the Dispute. Each Party
irrevocably consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York in connection with
any action permitted under this _Section 9.14_.

SECTION 2. _Grant of License to Casella ("License")_.

 



 

2.1 _Grant of License Inside Franchise Territory_. Subject to the terms of
this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, RE hereby grants to Casella and its

Territory to make, have made, import, copy, use, modify, enhance, prepare
derivative works of, offer for sale, sell and otherwise provide or distribute
products and services covered by the Licensed Patents, or incorporating or
based on (i) any non-patented information (which includes "know how" for each
use of the term in this Agreement) which is transferred to RE or its
Affiliates pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (including any non-patented
information that is owned by FCR or its Subsidiaries) and in the possession of
employees of Casella or its Subsidiaries immediately following the Closing
(other than the Business Employees (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) and
employees of FCR and its Subsidiaries) or (ii) Non-Patent Collaboration IP.
The license set forth in this Section 2.1 shall be exclusive with respect to
the Licensed Patents and non-exclusive with respect to the non-patented
information and Non-Patent Collaboration IP.

 



 

(a) _Transfer of License Rights with Transfer of Ownership of Casella
Facility_. Subject to the restrictions in the Purchase Agreement and the other
provisions of this Agreement, the License Rights granted by _Section 2.1_ of
this Agreement are sublicensable to any future owner of a Casella facility
(whether as a result of an asset transfer, stock transfer, merger or
otherwise) which may, as permitted herein, use the License Rights solely for
the purpose of operating such facility and the License Rights are
transferrable with the ownership of such facility so that the facility
maintains sufficient License Rights to continue operations subsequent to the
transfer of ownership; provided such transferred License Rights shall not in
any event exceed the scope of such License Rights at such facility as of the
date of the transference of the ownership of such facility and may not be
independently sublicensed to third parties who do not own or operate such
facility. The License Rights shall also extend to any upgrades and/or
replacements of such facility. The transfer of ownership of a Casella facility
and the transfer of the related License Rights as permitted above and
described in this section shall not require REs approval. For the avoidance
of doubt, Collaboration IP developed after the transference of the Casella
facility at issue is not and shall not be sublicensed to the third party
acquirer of such Casella facility under this provision.

 



 

2.2 _Engineered Feedstock Opportunity_ _._ Notwithstanding _Section 2.1_
hereof, if Casella elects to utilize the Engineered Feedstock IP or the
Collaboration IP within the Franchise Territory in connection with the
operation of a renewable energy, refuse to energy gasification or similar
project using Engineered Feedstock that converts waste to energy (an "
_Engineered Feedstock Opportunity_ "), RE shall have an option (the " _Option_
") to participate in such opportunity through a 50/50 Partnership, pursuant to
the terms and procedures set forth in this _Section 2.2_, and on such other
terms as Casella and RE agree.

 



 

(i) _Notice and Option Period_. Upon its election to pursue an Engineered
Feedstock Opportunity, Casella shall provide written notice to RE in
accordance

 



      
 

 



 

with _Section 12_ hereof, describing the proposed Engineered Feedstock
Opportunity in all material respects as well as the terms of a proposed 50/50
Partnership with RE (the " _Casella Term Sheet_ "). REs actual receipt of the
Casella Term Sheet will commence an option period which will remain open for a
period of sixty (60) days (the " _Option Period_ "), during which RE may
provide written notice to Casella of its election to proceed (the " _Election
to Proceed_ ") with the negotiation of a 50/50 Partnership for such Engineered
Feedstock Opportunity. In the event that RE does not deliver notice of its
Election to Proceed prior to the end of the Option Period, the Option shall
expire and, subject to the other terms of this Agreement, RE shall have no
further rights with respect to the Engineered Feedstock Opportunity. RE
understands and acknowledges that Casellas delivery of the Casella Term Sheet
may be in the context of a project which is the subject of a request for
proposals and nothing in this paragraph shall limit the right of Casella to
respond to and otherwise make progress under such request for proposal pending
the expiration or exercise of REs participation rights hereunder. Casella may
not enter into any agreement concerning such Engineered Feedstock Opportunity
with any third party that would violate this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) _Effect of Failure to Exercise the Option_. REs failure to deliver
notice of its Election to Proceed prior to expiration of the Option Period
will have no effect on the grant of the License to Casella or Casellas rights
hereunder, including Casellas right to subsequently pursue such Engineered
Feedstock Opportunity subject to the other terms of this Agreement, including
the restrictions set forth in _Section 2.4_; provided, however, that Casella
may not pursue such Engineered Feedstock Opportunity as specified in the
Casella Term Sheet with another Person on terms that are materially more
favorable to such Person, than those proposed to RE in the Casella Term Sheet.
Casellas right to pursue such Engineered Feedstock Opportunity with such
other Person shall include the right to sublicense to its joint venture with
such Person the License Rights granted to it under this Agreement, subject to
the execution by any such joint venture and other Person of a reasonable
confidentiality agreement and agreement to terms, including restrictions,
consistent with those set forth in this Agreement. Upon request, Casella and
its joint venture shall provide RE with the documentation necessary to confirm
Casellas compliance with such obligations, subject to REs execution and
delivery of a confidentiality agreement reasonably acceptable to both Parties.

 



 

(iii) _Negotiation Period_. Casellas receipt of notice of an Election to
Proceed from RE will commence a negotiation period (the " _Negotiation Period_
") which will remain open for a period of ninety (90) days during which the
parties shall in good faith negotiate the terms of a partnership or comparable
legal relationship to form the 50/50 Partnership with respect to the
Engineered Feedstock Opportunity (the " _Definitive Partnership Agreement_ ").
In the event that RE and Casella do not enter into a Definitive Partnership
Agreement prior to the end of the Negotiation Period, the Option shall expire
and, subject to the other terms of this Agreement, RE shall have no further
rights with respect to the Engineered Feedstock Opportunity.

 



 

(iv) _Effect of Failure to Execute a Definitive Partnership Agreement_. REs
failure to execute a Definitive Partnership Agreement prior to the expiration
of the Negotiation Period will have no effect on the grant of the License to
Casella or Casellas rights hereunder, including Casellas right to
subsequently pursue such Engineered Feedstock

 



      
 

 



 

Opportunity subject to the other terms of this Agreement, including the
restrictions set forth in _Section 2.4_; provided, however, that Casella may
not pursue such Engineered Feedstock Opportunity as specified in the Casella
Term Sheet with another Person on terms that are materially more favorable to
such Person, than those proposed to RE in the Casella Term Sheet Casellas
right to pursue such Engineered Feedstock Opportunity with such other Person
shall include the right to sublicense to its joint venture with such Person
the License Rights granted to it under this Agreement, subject to the
execution by any such joint venture and other Person of a reasonable
confidentiality agreement and agreement to terms, including restrictions,
consistent with those set forth in this Agreement. Upon request, Casella and
its joint venture shall provide RE with the documentation necessary to confirm
Casellas compliance with such obligations, subject to REs execution and
delivery of a confidentiality agreement reasonably acceptable to both Parties.

 



 

(v) _Expenses_. Each Party shall be responsible for one-half of all expenses
related to the Engineered Feedstock Opportunity that are incurred prior to the
execution of the Definitive Partnership Agreement, other than expenses
incurred by the Parties on their own behalf related to the negotiation,
drafting, and execution of the Definitive Partnership Agreement and any
related documentation (" _Feedstock Opportunity Expenses_ ").

 



 

(vi) _Co-Branding Rights_. In the event that RE elects to pursue a 50/50
Partnership pursuant hereto with respect to an Engineered Feedstock
Opportunity, the Parties shall agree on co-branding rights with respect to the
use of the Engineered Feedstock IP and Collaboration IP in connection with
such Engineered Feedstock Opportunity, prior to the use of any Engineered
Feedstock IP or Collaboration IP in connection with such Engineered Feedstock
Opportunity. The Parties negotiation of the co-branding rights shall be
conducted in good faith and such agreement on the co-branding rights shall not
be unreasonably delayed or withheld so as to delay activity in the Engineered
Feedstock Opportunity. All use of REs brands on any product or service,
including in connection with an Engineered Feedstock Opportunity in which RE
and Casella have a 50/50 Partnership, shall be subject to the prior written
approval of RE, which may be withheld or granted in REs sole discretion.
Similarly, all public disclosures, including press releases, concerning an
Engineered Feedstock Opportunity involving RE shall be subject to the prior
written approval of both Parties, which may be withheld or granted in such
Partys sole discretion, except to the extent such disclosure is required by
Law. If RE elects not to exercise the Option and join in a particular
Engineered Feedstock Opportunity, Casella may utilize any branding it wishes
to use in connection with such Engineered Feedstock Opportunity except for
branding, trademarks and service marks owned by RE or its Affiliates.

 



 

(vii) _Confidentiality_. RE agrees that all written information designated as
confidential by Casella and provided to RE pursuant to this _Section 2.2_, to
the extent not already publicly available or already known to RE without any
obligation of confidentiality, shall be held in confidence and not used by it
for any purpose other than for the purpose of evaluating and exercising the
Option and negotiating a Definitive Partnership Agreement. The obligations of
this _Section 2.2(a)(vii)_ shall expire upon the execution of the Definitive
Partnership Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(viii) _License Restriction_. If RE does not exercise the Option and Casella
otherwise pursues the identified Engineered Feedstock Opportunity, any
feedstock produced by Casella using the Licensed Patents or Collaboration IP
may not be sold, offered for sale, or distributed to any third party outside
the Franchise Territory or to a third party in the Franchise Territory for
such third partys use outside the Franchise Territory. Casella shall include
(and ensure that documentation is executed containing) a contractual
restriction consistent with the foregoing restriction and naming RE as an
express third party beneficiary in its agreement with such third parties.

 



 

2.3 _Grant of License Outside Franchise Territory_. Subject to the terms of
this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, RE hereby grants to Casella and its
Subsidiaries a non-exclusive, royalty-free, paid-up, perpetual license outside
the Franchise Territory to make, have made, import, copy, use, modify,
enhance, prepare derivative works of, offer for sale, sell and otherwise
provide or distribute products and services covered by the Licensed Patents,
or incorporating or based on (i) any non-patented information which is
transferred to RE or its Affiliates pursuant to the Purchase Agreement
(including any non-patented information that is owned by FCR or its
Subsidiaries) and in the possession of employees of Casella or its
Subsidiaries immediately following the Closing (other than the Business
Employees (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) and employees of FCR and its
Subsidiaries) or (ii) Non-Patent Collaboration IP, provided, however, that the
license granted in this Section 2.3 is limited to, and is intended to be no
broader than, use within the scope of the activities permitted under Section
6.8 of the Purchase Agreement. If, for any reason, the restrictions on
activities under the Purchase Agreement shall discontinue, this license grant
shall remain no broader than those activities permitted under Section 6.8 of
the Purchase Agreement as if those restrictions remained in effect.

 



 

(a) _Engineered Feedstock IP_. Casellas license to use Engineered Feedstock
IP or Collaboration IP outside the Franchise Territory requires REs prior
written consent, which may be withheld or granted in REs sole discretion.

 



 

(b) _Territorial Scope of Licensed Patents_. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that the territorial scope of the Licensed Patents is limited by the nature of
what a patent is and therefore the License Rights granted with respect to
patents and provided for in this _Section 2.3_ are necessarily limited to the
scope of those territorial limitations.

 



 

(c) _Transfer of License Rights with Transfer of Ownership of Casella
Facility_. Subject to the restrictions in the Purchase Agreement and the other
provisions of this Agreement, the License Rights granted by _Section 2.3_ of
this Agreement are sublicensable to any future owner of a Casella facility
(whether as a result of an asset transfer, stock transfer, merger or
otherwise) which may, as permitted herein, use the License Rights solely for
the purpose of operating such facility and the License Rights are
transferrable with the ownership of such facility so that the facility
maintains sufficient License Rights to continue operations subsequent to the
transfer of ownership; provided such transferred License Rights shall not in
any event exceed the scope of such License Rights at such facility as of the
date of the transference of the ownership of such facility and may not be
independently sublicensed to third parties who do not own or operate such
facility. The License Rights shall also extend to any upgrades and/or

 



      
 

 



 

replacements of such facility. The transfer of ownership of a Casella facility
and the transfer of the related License Rights as permitted above and
described in this section shall not require REs approval. For the avoidance
of doubt, Collaboration IP developed after the transference of the Casella
facility at issue is not and shall not be sublicensed to the third party
acquirer of such Casella facility under this provision.

 



 

2.4 _License Transfer Restriction_. Subject to _Sections 2.1(a), 2.3(c), 10,
and 17_ the License Rights, including the rights to the Licensed Patents and
Collaboration IP, may not be sublicensed or assigned without the prior written
consent of RE, which may be withheld or granted in REs sole discretion.

 



 

2.5 _Confidentiality_. Casella agrees that all non-patented information
licensed to Casella and certain other Persons pursuant to _Sections 2.1 and
2.3_ of this Agreement, to the extent not already publicly available, shall be
held in confidence, not disclosed to third parties, and not used by them for
any purpose other than for the purpose of internally operating their
respective businesses in the ordinary course and otherwise in accordance with
this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 3. _Collaboration Between The Parties_

 



 

3.1 _Collaboration Meetings_. From time to time, the Parties shall cause
certain of their employees knowledgeable in the inventions claimed by the
Licensed Patents and developing Intellectual Property in the RandD Field to meet
for purposes of developing and sharing information as to the Licensed Patents
and Intellectual Property in the RandD Field including new patent applications
filed, patents or applications or material know-how acquired or created by
either Party, and information ( _e.g_., test data) related to the Licensed
Patents and Intellectual Property in the RandD Field (each a " _Collaboration
Meeting_ "). Each Party may pick its own personnel in its sole discretion for
participation in the Collaboration Meetings. During each such Collaboration
Meeting, the Parties may also collaborate on developing new Intellectual
Property in the RandD Field. The results of the Collaboration Meetings should,
insofar as possible, be reduced to writing and shared with the meeting
participants.

 



 

3.2 _Collaboration IP_. All Intellectual Property disclosed or developed by
the Parties at such Collaboration Meetings with respect to the RandD Field
(collectively " _Collaboration IP_ ") shall be the sole property of RE. To the
extent that such Collaboration IP is not otherwise owned by RE by operation of
law or otherwise, Casella, on its own behalf and on behalf of its employees,
hereby assigns its entire right, title and interest in and to the
Collaboration IP to RE, without requiring any further compensation. Prior to
permitting any of their employees to attend a Collaboration Meeting, each
Party shall cause such employees to have executed written agreements securing
their respective ownership from the employee of all Intellectual Property to
be shared or learned by the employee at the Collaboration Meetings. Casella
shall, and shall use reasonable efforts to cause its employees to, execute all
documents reasonably requested by RE to confirm REs ownership of the
Collaboration IP and to enable RE to prosecute any applications for patents or
registrations filed in connection with the Collaboration IP.

 



      
 

 



 

3.3 _Additional Licensed Patents_. RE may from time to time elect to file
patent applications or obtain patents covering the Collaboration IP. To the
extent that RE does so, the prosecution and maintenance of such patents and
patent applications shall be handled by RE at REs sole expense. All patent
applications filed and patents obtained by RE that claim the Collaboration IP
shall be deemed "Licensed Patents" hereunder and licensed to Casella as
provided in _Section 2_; provided that because the Collaboration IP relates
to Engineered Feedstock, it shall be deemed Engineered Feedstock IP and
treated accordingly once such Collaboration IP becomes the subject of a patent
application or issued patent.

 



 

3.4 _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Subject to 3.4(b) below, all discussions and disclosures made by a Party
to the other Party at a Collaboration Meeting shall be kept confidential by
the receiving Party; provided that the foregoing restriction shall not prevent
any Party from disclosing its own information and Intellectual Property to a
third party or disclosing Collaboration IP as otherwise expressly permitted
under this Agreement

 



 

(b) In connection with any anticipated use by Casella or an authorized joint
venture pursuant to Section 2.2 of this Agreement of any Collaboration IP in a
manner which may adversely affect the patentability of such Collaboration IP,
Casella will cooperate on a commercially reasonable basis with RE in order to
enable RE to prepare and file patent applications from such Collaboration IP;
provided, however, that RE understands and acknowledges that Casellas
anticipated use of such Collaboration IP may be in the context of a project
which is the subject of a request for proposals in which case RE shall
cooperate with Casella in the development of a response to such proposal which
shall be subject to appropriate confidentiality provisions or other
limitations on disclosure. Any disclosure of non-public Collaboration IP to a
third party by Casella may only be made to a third party provided that an
appropriate confidentiality agreement with provisions no less stringent than
those set forth in this Section 3.4 is entered into with such third party
naming RE as an express third party beneficiary.

 



 

3.5 _Termination of Collaboration Meetings_. Upon the execution of a
definitive agreement for a Change of Control of either Casella or RE or an
assignment of this Agreement to the extent permitted by _Section 17.1_ below,
either Party may by written notice to the other terminate the provisions of
_Section 3.1_ above, provided however, that such termination shall not affect
the provisions of _Sections 3.2 through 3.4_ with respect to any Collaboration
IP previously developed. If, for whatever reason, such definitive agreement is
terminated prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control of either Party, the
provisions of _Sections 3.1_ shall be reinstated. The Party which is the
subject of the Change of Control shall provide notice to the other Party
pursuant to _Section 12_ of this Agreement prior to the occurrence of any
Change of Control.

 



 

SECTION 4. _RE s Maintenance of Licensed Patents and Patent Litigation_

 



 

4.1 _Maintenance of Licensed Patents_. During the Term of this Agreement, RE
shall maintain the Licensed Patents as it deems appropriate in its sole
discretion.

 



      
 

 



 

(a) In the event that RE decides not to maintain or prosecute any individual
patent or application included within the Licensed Patents, RE shall inform
Casella in a timely manner of the intent to discontinue maintenance or
prosecution of the individual patent or application.

 



 

(b) Upon notice to Casella as referenced in _Section 4.1(a)_ above, Casella
shall have the option but not the obligation to assume responsibility for the
maintenance or prosecution of the individual patent or application. In such an
event, Casella shall notify RE in writing of its intention to assume
responsibility for such maintenance or prosecution and shall provide to RE all
required documents to be filed, not less than thirty (30) days before each
applicable maintenance or prosecution due date or deadline, until such patent
or application is assigned according to Section 4.1(c) below, after which time
RE will no longer have any responsibility for, or obligations related to, the
maintenance or prosecution of such assigned patent or application.

 



 

(c) If Casella assumes responsibility for the maintenance or prosecution of an
individual patent or application included within the Licensed Patents as
provided for in _Section 4.1(b)_ above, then RE shall thereupon assign the
patent or application to Casella for the agreed upon price of $1.00.

 



 

4.2 _Patent Litigation_.

 



 

(a) RE shall have the right, but not the obligation, to commence any action at
law or in equity at its own expense against any third party for infringement
of one or more of the Licensed Patents. With respect to any legal actions
instituted, (i) RE may join Casella in such action and include it as a named
party in the action if Casella is a necessary party under applicable Law; (ii)
Casella may, at its option and expense, participate in such action ( _e.g_.,
as a party in the action or otherwise); (iii) Casella shall assist RE in the
prosecution of such litigation to the extent reasonably requested and RE shall
reimburse Casella for its reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses incurred
in connection with such assistance unless Casella voluntarily joins in such
action in which case Casella shall bear all of its costs and expenses; and
(iv) except as provided in the following sentence RE shall retain any recovery
in such action. If Casella joins in such action and has paid for all of its
own costs and expenses, including legal fees, RE and Casella shall share in
proportion to the damages for the acts of infringement outside and inside the
Franchise Territory, respectively, in such action after each Parties expenses
and legal fees have been deducted from the recovery.

 



 

(b) If, however, RE elects not to institute such an action against a third
party with respect to infringement within the Franchise Territory, it shall
promptly notify Casella in writing and Casella shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to institute action at its own expense against such third
party. With respect to any such legal actions instituted by Casella, (i)
Casella may join RE in such action and include it as a named party in the
action if RE is a necessary party under applicable Law; (ii) RE may, at its
option and expense, participate in such action ( _e.g_., as a party in the
action or otherwise); (iii) RE shall assist Casella in the prosecution of such
litigation to the extent reasonably requested and Casella shall reimburse RE
for its reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with such
assistance unless RE voluntarily

 



   

     
 

 



 

joins in such action in which case RE shall bear all of its costs and
expenses; and (iv) Casella shall retain any recovery in such action related to
infringement in the Franchise Territory, with any recovery relating the
territories outside the Franchise Territory being provided to and retained by
RE should it join in the action and pay its own legal fees and costs.

 



 

4.3 _Authorization_. RE hereby represents and warrants to Casella that RE is a
limited liability company duly organized and validly existing under the laws
of the State of Delaware with the full legal right, power and authority to
enter into and perform this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this
representation and warranty does not extend to, or constitute any
representation or warranty with respect to, any Intellectual Property or
related rights acquired by RE from Casella or its Affiliates pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 5. _Casella s Obligations_.

 



 

5.1 _Grant-back License_. To the extent that Casella, any of its Subsidiaries,
or any of its authorized sublicensees creates, invents, or obtains pursuant to
_Section 4.1(b)_ of this Agreement, or otherwise creates or invents any
Intellectual Property rights using the Licensed Patents (collectively, the "
_Improvement IP_ "), Casella, for itself and on behalf of its Subsidiaries and
authorized sublicensees grants to RE and its Subsidiaries a non-exclusive,
perpetual, royalty-free, paid-up world-wide license to make, have made,
import, copy, use, modify, enhance, prepare derivative works of, offer for
sale, sell and otherwise distribute products and services covered by the
Improvement IP ("Grant-back License"). Casella shall notify RE in writing upon
the filing of an application to register or obtain a patent covering such
Improvement IP and subsequently upon the issuance of the related registration
or patent. REs rights and obligations with respect to this Grant-back License
shall be subject to terms and restrictions to RE that are reciprocally similar
to those applied to Casella under Sections 2.1(a), 2.3(c), 2.4, 4, 5.2, and
9.2 of this Agreement.

 



 

5.2 _Casella s Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. Casella
represents, warrants and covenants that it, its Subsidiaries and any of its
authorized sublicensees shall:

 



 

(a) comply in all material respects with federal, state, and local laws,
rules, and regulations in the performance of this Agreement and its use of the
License Rights, including any applicable patent marking requirements;

 



 

(b) not take any action that injures or impairs or is reasonably likely to
injure or impair the Licensed Patents, Collaboration IP, or REs rights
therein;

 



 

(c) not take any action in violation of or inconsistent with the limitations
and restrictions placed on the License Rights;

 



 

(d) not challenge (by way of asserting a claim or otherwise) the validity or
enforceability of any of the Licensed Patents or provide any information or
support to any Person for the purpose of such Person using such information or
support to make any challenge (by way of asserting a claim or otherwise)
against any of the Licensed Patents;

 



      
 

 



 

(e) file, or support any Person in filing, for inter-parte or ex-parte re-
examination, nullity or opposition proceeding or otherwise oppose or
challenge, or support any Person in opposing or challenging, the granting or
enforceability of any of the Licensed Patents; and

 



 

(f) not attempt to register (or apply to register) any Collaboration IP or
obtain any patents (or apply to obtain any patents) that claim subject matter
of the RandD Field in any jurisdiction.

 



 

5.3 _Sublicense Conditions_. Any sublicense of License Rights pursuant to
Sections 2.1(a) and 2.3(c), shall be made in writing. In such written
agreements, Casella shall identify, and the sublicensee shall acknowledge and
accept, this Agreement and the scope of each of the obligations and
restrictions hereunder. Further, RE shall be identified as a third party
beneficiary in each such agreement. Provided that Casella and its
Subsidiaries comply with the foregoing in granting sublicenses, Casella and
its Subsidiaries shall not be deemed in breach of this Section 5 as a result
of the conduct of the sublicensee. In such case, RE shall be responsible for
addressing the activities of such sublicensee who is in violation of this
Section 5.

 



 

5.4 _Authorization_. Casella hereby represents and warrants to RE that Casella
is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the
State of Delaware with the full legal right, power and authority to enter into
and perform this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 6. _Disclaimer_

 



 

6.1 Each Party makes no representations or warranties of any kind with respect

until the issue is addressed pursuant to _Section 9.1_ of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 8. _Limitation of Liability_.

 



 

8.1 Neither Party shall be liable to the other Party, its sublicensees or
customers, or any other third parties for any consequential, punitive,
multiple, special or other indirect damages whatsoever, regardless of whether
such liability is based on breach of contract, tort, strict liability, breach
of warranties, infringement of Intellectual Property, failure of essential
purpose or otherwise, and even if advised of the possibility of such damages;
except to the extent that such damages are actually paid by a Party to a third
party.

 



 

8.2 The terms and provisions of this _Section 8_ shall survive the expiration
or any termination of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 9. _Governing Law and Dispute Resolution_.

 



 

9.1 THIS AGREEMENT AND THE LEGAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW

FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED WITHIN NEW YORK COUNTY IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL
HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OVER ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTIES

AND THE AGREEMENTS, INSTRUMENTS AND DOCUMENTS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THE
PARTIES CONSENT TO AND AGREE TO SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH
COURTS. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES AND AGREES NOT TO ASSERT IN ANY SUCH
DISPUTE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY CLAIM THAT (A)

RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT IN ANY FORUM OTHER THAN EXCLUSIVELY IN THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS
LOCATED WITHIN NEW YORK COUNTY IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

 



 

9.2 Casella acknowledges and agrees that its breach (or any breach by its
sublicensees, if any are authorized hereunder) of this Agreement or the use of
the Licensed Patents or Collaboration IP in violation of this Agreement shall
cause irreparable harm to RE and that in any resulting proceedings, RE shall
be entitled to injunctive relief without being required to post a bond or
provide an undertaking.

 



      
 

 



 

9.3 The Parties hereby agree that mailing of process or other papers in
connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in this

SECTION 10. _Casella Change of Control_.

 



 

10.1 In the event of a Change of Control of Casella, the License Rights
identified in _Section 2_ and the rights and obligations set forth in
_Section 4.1_ shall terminate immediately, except as noted below:

 



 

(a) The License Rights as they existed as of the date of the Change of Control
shall continue unaffected with respect to existing facilities of Casella and
its Subsidiaries (and joint ventures in which Casella or Casellas
Subsidiaries are parties as permitted in this Agreement and the Purchase
Agreement and facilities sublicensed pursuant to Sections 2.1(a) or 2.3(c)),
including any upgrades and replacements (including facilities of Casellas
Subsidiaries and of joint ventures in which Casella or Casellas Subsidiaries
are parties as permitted in this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement and
facilities sublicensed pursuant to Sections 2.1(a) or 2.3(c)), and for any new
facility of Casella or its Subsidiaries (and joint ventures in which Casella
or Casellas Subsidiaries are parties as permitted in this Agreement and the
Purchase Agreement) for which permits have been applied for by or on behalf of
Casella or its Subsidiaries or any authorized joint venture prior to the
Change of Control of Casella. These limited continued License Rights for such
facilities may not be independently sublicensed to third parties who do not
own or operate such facility and may not be used at any facility or location
other than the specific facility authorized prior to the Casella Change of
Control. For the avoidance of doubt, if the licensed facility is inoperable as
a result of no fault of the sublicensee/licensee, an upgrade and/or
replacement facility can include site changes for the facility to another
nearby location, provided such location is within ten (10) miles of the
original location of the facility licensed hereunder.

 



 

10.2 For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a Change of Control of
Casella, the License Rights shall not extend to any uses of, operations or
facilities owned or operated by, the acquirer of Casella or any of such
acquirers Subsidiaries other than as provided in the preceding paragraph.

 



 

SECTION 11. _Independent Contractors; No Third Party Rights_.

 



 

11.1 Each Party is acting as an independent contractor in entering into and
performing its obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement is not
intended to, and shall not be deemed to, create a joint venture, partnership,
agency or employer-employee relationship between the Parties. Nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed to confer any benefit on, or create any
obligation, duty or liability to, or create any standard of care with respect
to, any person, firm or entity not a Party to this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 12. _Notices_.

 



 

12.1 Except as otherwise provided herein, all notices, requests, claims,

SECTION 16. _Extension; Waiver_.

 



 

16.1 No failure or delay on the part of any Party in the exercise of any right
hereunder shall impair such right or be construed as a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right
preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right.

 



 

SECTION 17. _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_.

 



 

17.1 This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the
Parties and their permitted successors and assigns. Other than in connection
with a Change of Control of Casella, neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by Casella

REs sole discretion. Any attempted assignment in violation of this

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 17_ will be void. Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, RE
may assign this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations
hereunder in its sole discretion.

20.1 If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to
be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions contained in
this Agreement shall remain valid and binding and shall in no way be affected,
impaired or invalidated, and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and
enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
term, provision, covenant or restriction or any portion thereof had never been
contained herein.

 



 

SECTION 21. _Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

21.1 EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, AND
