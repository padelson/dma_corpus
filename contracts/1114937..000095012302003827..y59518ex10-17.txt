                      (ii)       the reasons why each matter is disputed.

           (b)        Once the Vendor Guarantor or the Purchaser has given a
                      Dispute Notice, the relevant party may not dispute any
                      further items or amounts in the Completions Accounts.

           (c)        If the Vendor Guarantor and the Purchaser have not
                      resolved the dispute within 10 Business Days after the
                      date the Dispute Notice was given, they must promptly
                      submit the matter or matters in dispute to the Independent
                      Accountant for determination.

           (d)        The identity of the Independent Accountant must be agreed
                      by the Vendor Guarantor and the Purchaser. If the Vendor

                      Days of the Purchaser giving the Purchaser Response to the

                      nominated, at the request of either the Vendor Guarantor
                      or the Purchaser, by the President of the Institute of
                      Chartered Accountants (New South Wales Branch).

           (e)        The disputed matters must be referred to the Independent
                      Accountant by written submission which must include the
                      Completion Accounts, the Dispute Notice, and an extract of
                      the relevant provisions of the agreement. The Independent
                      Accountant must also be instructed to finish its
                      determination no later than 15 Business Days after its
                      appointment (or another period agreed by the parties). The
                      Vendor Guarantor and the Purchaser will each be entitled
                      to submit written representations to the Independent
                      Accountant.

           (f)        The parties must promptly give the Independent Accountant
                      any information, assistance and cooperation requested in
                      writing by the Independent Accountant in connection with
                      its determination. All correspondence between the
                      Independent Accountant and a party must be copied to the
                      other parties.

           (g)        The Independent Accountant must act as an expert and not
                      as an arbitrator and its written determination will be
                      final and binding on the parties in the absence of
                      manifest error and the Completion Accounts will be deemed
                      to be amended accordingly and will be taken to comprise
                      the final Completion Accounts.

6.7        COSTS

           The costs of the:

           (a)        Auditors in preparing the Completion Accounts; and

           (b)        the Independent Accountant (if instructed),

           will be borne by the Vendor Guarantor as to one half, and the

9.7        PROVISIONS AND RECOVERIES

           Despite any other provision of this agreement, the Warrantor has no
           Liability for a Warranty Claim to the extent that (but only to the
           extent that):

           (a)        the Warranty Claim is set off against and deducted from
                      the Deferred Amount;

           (b)        the subject matter of the Warranty Claim is provided for
                      or fairly disclosed in the Accounts or the Purchaser

9.8        FINANCIAL LIMITS

           The Warrantor has no Liability for a Warranty Claim:

           (a)        unless the Liability of the Warrantor in respect of such
                      Warranty Claim (or series of related Warranty Claims (eg
                      stamp duty claims)) is $500,000 or more; and

                      under CLAUSE 9.8(a)) exceeds $8.5 million, in which case
                      the Warrantor shall be Liable (subject always to the other
                      provisions of this CLAUSE 9) for the full amount and not

           The maximum Liability of the Warrantor (including legal costs and

9.10       TIME LIMITS

           Except for a Warranty Claim in relation to the Vendors' title to the
           Shares (where no time limit will apply), the Warrantor has no
           Liability for a Warranty Claim unless:

           (a)        in the case of a Warranty Claim relating to any Warranty
                      other than those in PARAGRAPHS 8.1(a) and 16 (Taxation) of
                      SCHEDULE 3, the Purchaser has given written notice of the
                      Warranty Claim to the Warrantor under CLAUSE 9.11 on or
                      before 30 September 2003;

           (b)        in the case of a Warranty Claim relating to any Warranty

                                                                   NTL AUSTRALIA
                                                            SHARE SALE AGREEMENT


           (c)        in either case, unless the Warranty Claim has been settled
                      or legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction
                      in respect of the Warranty Claim have been commenced by
                      the Purchaser against the Warrantor within six months of
                      the Warranty Claim being notified by the Purchaser to the
                      Warrantor.

9.11       NOTICE OF POTENTIAL WARRANTY CLAIM

           If the Purchaser becomes aware of anything which is or may be
           reasonably likely to give rise to a Warranty Claim under this CLAUSE
           9, it must notify the Warrantor in writing (CLAIM NOTICE):

           (a)        setting out the act, matter or thing relied on as giving
                      rise to the Warranty Claim, the Warranty the subject of
                      the Warranty Claim and all relevant details of the
                      Warranty Claim; and

           (b)        within 20 Business Days after it has first come to the
                      Purchaser's attention.

           For the avoidance of doubt, breach by the Purchaser of this CLAUSE
           9.11 will not prejudice the Purchaser's right to make a Warranty
           Claim.

9.12       DOUBLE CLAIMS

           (a)        The Warrantor has no Liability for a Warranty Claim to the
                      extent that the loss occasioned by the fact, matter, event
                      or circumstance giving rise to such Warranty Claim is
                      recovered under any other provision of this agreement or
                      any of the other agreements to be entered into pursuant to
                      this agreement.

           (b)        If the same fact, matter, event or circumstance gives rise
                      to more than one Warranty Claim, no member of the
                      Purchaser Group is entitled to recover more than once in
                      respect of the same loss arising out of such fact, matter,
                      event or circumstance.

9.13       CHANGES AFTER THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT

           The Warrantor shall not be liable for any Warranty Claim to the
           extent that (but only to the extent that) it arises, or is increased
           or extended by:

           (a)        any change to legislation, any decision of any court or
                      tribunal, any increase in rates of Taxation or any change
                      in the published practice of a Taxation authority, in each
                      case made on and/or after the date of this agreement
                      (provided in each case the previously applying law or
                      practice has been complied with by the Target Group);

           (b)        any change in the financial year end of any member of the
                      Purchaser Group made on and/or after Completion;

           (c)        any change in any accounting policy or practice of any
                      member of the Purchaser Group made on and/or after
                      Completion, save where such change is required to conform
                      such policy or practice with generally accepted policies
                      or practices or where such change is necessary to correct
                      an improper policy or practice;

           (d)        any cessation of, or any change in, the nature or conduct
                      of any business carried on by any member of the Purchaser
                      Group being a cessation or change

                      occurring on and/or after Completion and not as a direct
                      result of the subject matter of the Warranty Claim; or

           (e)        any act, omission or transaction outside the ordinary and
                      usual course of business which is carried out or effected
                      by, or at the request or with the approval of any member
                      of the Purchaser Group (or any of their respective
                      directors or authorised officers or employees), other than
                      any act, omission or transaction contemplated by this
                      agreement.

9.14       RIGHTS OF THE WARRANTOR

           (a)        The Warrantor, subject to this CLAUSE 9.14, is in respect
                      of an act, matter or thing notified by the Purchaser under
                      CLAUSE 9.11, where that act, matter or thing relates to an
                      actual or threatened Claim from a third party, entitled to
                      elect by written notice given to the Purchaser within 10
                      Business Days of receipt of a Claim Notice to (at the

                      (i)        take over the conduct of the Claim; and

                      (ii)       take such actions as the Warrantor may decide
                                 about it, including the right to negotiate,
                                 defend and/or settle the Claim and to recover
                                 costs incurred as a consequence of the Claim
                                 from any person.

           (b)        Where the Warrantor takes over the conduct and/or defence
                      of any claim under this CLAUSE 9.14, the Warrantor must:

                      (i)        afford the Purchaser the opportunity to consult
                                 with the Warrantor on all matters of
                                 significance for the goodwill of the Business;
                                 and

                      (ii)       at reasonable and regular intervals provide the
                                 Purchaser with written reports concerning the
                                 conduct, negotiation, control, defence and/or
                                 outcome or settlement of the Claim.

           (c)        The Purchaser must, and must procure that the Company and
                      each Target Group Company must, provide the Warrantor with
                      access to (with the right to take copies) and make
                      available to the Warrantor all relevant personnel,
                      relevant documents, books and records reasonably required
                      for the purpose of the conduct of any Claim under CLAUSE
                      9.14(a).

9.15       RIGHTS OF THE PURCHASER

           If the Purchaser gives the Warrantor a Claim Notice falling within
           CLAUSE 9.14(a) and the Warrantor does not elect to take over the
           control of a Claim under CLAUSE 9.14, the Purchaser may take such
           actions as the Purchaser may decide about it, including the right to
           negotiate, defend and/or settle the Claim and to recover costs
           incurred as a consequence of the Claim from any person, provided
           that:

           (a)        the Purchaser must at reasonable and regular intervals
                      provide the Warrantor with written reports concerning the
                      conduct, negotiation, control, defence and/or settlement
                      of the Claim and must not settle the Claim without the
                      prior approval of the Warrantor which must not be
                      unreasonably withheld;

                                                                   NTL AUSTRALIA
                                                            SHARE SALE AGREEMENT


           (b)        the Purchaser must afford the Warrantor the opportunity to
                      consult with the Purchaser on matters of significance in
                      relation to the conduct, negotiation and settlement of the
                      Claim; and

           (c)        the Warrantor must render to the Purchaser, at the
                      Purchaser's expense (but without prejudice to the
                      Purchaser's ability to seek recovery of that expense under
                      a Warranty Claim), all such assistance as the Purchaser
                      may reasonably require in disputing any Claim.

9.16       CONDUCT OF CLAIM INDEMNITY

           (a)        The Warrantor indemnifies the Purchaser, the Company, SPT
                      and the Target Group against all Liabilities incurred by,
                      or awarded against, any of them arising out of the conduct
                      of the Warrantor under CLAUSE 9.14 or acts required or
                      requested of any of them in respect of the same, as and
                      when they fall due, including legal costs and
                      disbursements of the relevant entity's lawyers.

           (b)        The restrictions on the Warrantor's Liability in respect
                      of Warranty Claims in this CLAUSE 9 do not apply in
                      relation to the indemnity in CLAUSE 9.16(a).

           (c)        The Purchaser holds the benefit of the indemnity in CLAUSE
                      9.16(a) on trust for itself and for the Company, SPT and
                      each Target Group Company.

9.17       NOTIFICATION OF CREDIT BY THE PURCHASER

           If any payment in respect of a Warranty Claim under the Warranties is
           made to the Purchaser by or on behalf of the Warrantor and after the
           payment is made the Purchaser receives any benefit or credit by
           reason of the matters to which the Warranty Claim relates, then the
           Purchaser:

           (a)        must immediately notify the Warrantor of the benefit or
                      credit; and

           (b)        provided there are no outstanding Warranty Claims by the
                      Purchaser (in which case, the Purchaser may apply the
                      amount of the benefit or credit by way of set-off against
                      such Warranty Claims), pay to the Warrantor an amount
                      equal to that paid to the Purchaser by or on behalf of the
                      Warrantor or (if less) the amount of the benefit or credit
                      received by the Purchaser,

           and the Purchaser's payment will be treated as a credit against the
           Warrantor's maximum aggregate liability under CLAUSE 9.9.

9.18       REMEDIABLE BREACHES

           The Warrantor will have no Liability for any Warranty Claim to the
           extent that the fact, matter, event or circumstance giving rise to
           such Warranty Claim is remediable and is remedied by or at the
           expense of the Warrantor within 60 Business Days of the date on which
           the relevant notice of the Claim is given to the Warrantor. Subject
           to the other limitations on Warranty Claims in this CLAUSE 9, the
           Warrantor will remain liable in respect of all loss and damage
           suffered or incurred by the Company or a Target Group Company prior
           to the relevant fact, matter, event or circumstance being remedied to
           the extent such loss and damage is not itself remedied or reimbursed.

9.19       REIMBURSEMENT OF CLAIMS

           If, after the Warrantor has made any payment in respect of a Warranty
           Claim, the recipient of that payment becomes entitled to recover from
           a third party (whether by payment, discount, credit, relief or
           otherwise) a sum which is referable to that payment by the Warrantor
           (RECOVERY AMOUNT), then upon actually receiving the Recovery Amount,
           the Purchaser must promptly repay (or procure the repayment) to the
           Warrantor so much of the Recovery Amount (after deduction of the
           recipient's reasonable costs of recovery) as does not exceed the
           amount paid by the Warrantor. The amount of the repayment must be
           deducted from the Warrantor's aggregate Liability in any future
           determination as to whether the financial cap in CLAUSE 9.9 has been
           exceeded.

9.20       UNASCERTAINABLE CLAIMS

           Except as provided in this CLAUSE 9.20, the Warrantor will have no
           Liability for any Warranty Claim which arises by reason of a
           Liability which, at the time when the relevant Claim Notice is given,
           is contingent only or is otherwise not capable of being quantified.
           The Warrantor will not be Liable to make any payment in respect of
           any such Warranty Claim:

           (a)        unless and until the Liability becomes an actual Liability
                      or (as the case may be) becomes capable of being
                      quantified; and

           (b)        unless the Liability becomes an actual Liability on or
                      before the sixth anniversary of the Completion Date.

9.21       MITIGATION

           The Purchaser must take, and must procure that each other member of
           the Purchaser Group takes, all reasonable action to mitigate any loss
           suffered by it which would, could or might result in a Warranty Claim
           against the Warrantor.

9.22       DEBT CLAIMS

           If the Warrantor makes any payment in relation to a Warranty Claim
           for any unpaid debt due to any member of the Purchaser Group then, if
           the Warrantor so elects, the Purchaser must (or must procure that the
           relevant member of the Purchaser Group must) assign the benefit of
           the debt to the Warrantor for a nominal consideration.

9.23       EFFECT OF PAYMENT

           A payment to the Purchaser under this CLAUSE 9 is, to the extent
           possible, to be treated as a reduction in the Purchase Price.

9.24       SURVIVAL

           The provisions of this CLAUSE 9 remain in full force and effect after
           Completion.

                           a result of the acquisition of or by any member of
                           the Vendor Group, or the merger of any member of the
                           Vendor Group with, another entity outside Australia
                           as part of a larger transaction of which the business
                           in Australia is not a material part of the business
                           as a whole.

         (c)      CLAUSE 14.1(a)(iii) shall not apply to:

                  (ii)     any recruitment of any person through a recruitment
                           agency (other than where such agencies deliberately
                           target employees covered by the provisions of CLAUSE
                           14.1) or as a response to a newspaper, web page or
                           other public employment advertisement.

14.3     SEVERABILITY

         If the prohibition or restriction contained in CLAUSE 14.1 is judged to
         go beyond what is reasonable in the circumstances and necessary to
         protect the goodwill of any Target Group Company but would be judged
         reasonable and necessary if any activity were deleted or the period or
         area were reduced, then the prohibitions or restrictions apply with
         that activity deleted or that period or area reduced by the minimum
         amount necessary.

14.4     ACKNOWLEDGMENTS BY THE WARRANTOR

         (a)      The Warrantor acknowledges that the prohibitions and
                  restrictions contained in this CLAUSE 14 are reasonable in the
                  circumstances and necessary to protect the value of the Shares
                  and the goodwill of the Target Group.

         (b)      The Warrantor acknowledges that in relation to this agreement
                  and in particular this CLAUSE 14 it has received legal advice
                  OR has had the opportunity of obtaining legal advice.

         (c)      The Warrantor acknowledges that monetary damages alone would
                  not be adequate compensation to the Purchaser for the
                  Warrantor's breach of this CLAUSE 14 and that the Purchaser is
                  entitled to seek an injunction from a court of competent
                  jurisdiction if:

                  (i)      the Warrantor fails to comply or threatens to fail to
                           comply with this CLAUSE 14; or

                  (ii)     the Purchaser has reason to believe the Warrantor
                           will not comply with this CLAUSE 14.

                           and to preserve the confidentiality of the

                  expense incurred in connection with this agreement, the
                  reimbursement or indemnity payment must not include any GST
                  component of the cost or expense for which an input tax credit
                  may be claimed by the party entitled to be reimbursed or
                  indemnified, or by its representative member.

         rights to the pledgee.

20.      WAIVER

20.1     FAILURE TO REQUIRE PERFORMANCE

         The failure of a party at any time to require performance of any

           type and on similar terms and conditions to that to be provided to

                      assets, other than for decrements in the value of these
                      assets;

           (b)        there must be no reduction in provisions other than for
                      payments made specifically relating to items for which
                      those provisions were made;

           (c)        deferred tax assets will not be recognised;

           (d)        insurance receivables will not be recognised, other than
                      for those where the insurer has confirmed in writing that
                      payment will be made;

           (e)        the SPT joint venture must be accounted for on the cost
                      basis and not equity accounted or consolidated, adjusted
                      for any decrement in the value of the investment; and

           (f)        any forgiveness of inter company debt owing by the group
                      must be treated as if it had not occurred.

1.2        APPLICATION OF POLICIES

           (a)        If there is a conflict between GAAP and the special
                      accounting policies referred to in paragraph 1.1, the
                      special accounting policies will prevail.

           (b)        Accounting policies must be consistently applied between
                      the Accounts and the Completion Accounts, except where a
                      special accounting policy referred to in paragraph 1.1
                      requires a different treatment.

           (c)        Where an item in the Completion Accounts is not governed
                      by GAAP, the Vendor Auditor should apply International
                      Accounting Standards relevant to the item, or, if these do
                      not govern the item, generally accepted accounting
                      principles for entities in a similar industry to the
                      Target Group.

1.3        NOTES

           The Completion Accounts must include disclosure of the accounting
           policies used and notes to the accounts (consistent with the notes
           disclosed in the Accounts).
