hereinafter defined), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company,
with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in such merger as a
direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, in accordance with the Nevada

time, on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than
the second business day after satisfaction (or waiver in accordance with this
Agreement) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI
(other than any such conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied
until the Closing Date, which shall be required to be so satisfied or (to the
extent permitted by applicable law) waived on the Closing Date), at the
offices of Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. in Dallas, Texas, unless another date or
place is agreed to in writing by the parties (such date on which the Closing
occurs, the " _Closing Date_ ").

  



  

1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time: (i) Merger Sub shall
be merged with and into the Company, the separate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the
Company is sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ");
and (ii) the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Haggar Corp." The
Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the NRS. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations and duties

obligations and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

1.4 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective time, the
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company shall be amended and
restated to be identical to the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of
Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, which shall be

thereafter amended in accordance with their respective terms and applicable
law.

  



  

2   

     
   

  



  

1.5 _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the
directors and officers of Merger Sub shall be the directors and officers of

their death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

# **ARTICLE II**

  

# 

  

# **EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB;
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

  

# 

  

2.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any party or the
holder of any shares of common stock of the Company, par value $0.10 per
share (" _Company Common Stock_ "), or capital stock of Merger Sub:

  



  

### (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain outstanding and shall be converted into and shall represent one share
of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, so
that, after the Effective Time, Parent shall be the holder of all of the
issued and outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporations capital stock.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Capital Stock of the Company_. Each share of Company Common Stock
and the associated right (the " _Right_ ") to purchase Series B Junior
Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.10 per share (" _Company Series
B Preferred Stock_"), of the Company in accordance with the Company
Rights Agreement (references in this Agreement to shares of Company Common
Stock shall also be deemed to refer to the Rights associated therewith, as
appropriate) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into the right to receive TWENTY NINE DOLLARS ($29.00) in
cash, without interest (subject to any required withholding pursuant to
Section 2.4(g)) (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such shares of Company
Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon
the surrender of such certificates in accordance with Section 2.4. All shares
of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury shares or by Parent
or Merger Sub or by any Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist as of the
Effective Time and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in
exchange therefor. No stockholders of the Company shall be entitled to
dissenters rights in connection with the Merger pursuant to the NRS or
otherwise.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Impact of Stock Splits, etc_. In the event of any change in the
Company Common Stock between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or the
like, the Merger Consideration to be paid for each share of Company Common
Stock as provided in this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

2.2 _Treatment of Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company
or any of their respective stockholders other than as required by Section
2.4(c)(ii), each option for the purchase of Company Common Stock (" _Company
Stock Option_ ") then outstanding, whether or not exercisable, under the
Companys 1992 Long Term Incentive Plan and 2003 Long Term Incentive Plan
(together, the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), shall (if not then fully
exercisable) become fully exercisable and shall thereafter represent the
right to receive only the following consideration: for each share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option an amount in cash equal to
the difference, if any, between (i) the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of a share of Company Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise
price of such Company Stock Option to the extent such difference is a
positive number (such amount in cash as described above being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Option Consideration_ "). The Company shall cause the
termination, effective at the Effective Time, of the Company Stock Plans.

  



  

2.3 _Treatment of Restricted Company Common Stock_. Immediately prior to
the Effective Time, the restrictions applicable to each share of restricted
Company Common Stock issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plans shall
immediately lapse, and, at the Effective Time, each share of such Company
Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms hereof.

  



  

2.4 _Payment for Securities_.

  



  

### (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall enter
into an agreement with the Companys transfer agent (or another entity
reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as agent for the stockholders of
the Company and holders of the Company Stock Options in connection with the
Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and to receive the Merger Consideration and
the Option Consideration to which the stockholders of the Company and holders
of the Company Stock Options shall become entitled pursuant to this ARTICLE
II. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for
the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Company
Stock Options, for payment in accordance with this ARTICLE II, through the
Paying Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to permit payment of the aggregate
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1 and the aggregate Option
Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.2 (the " _Payment Fund_ "). The
Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1 and the Option Consideration
payable pursuant to Section 2.2, in each case, out of the Payment Fund.
The Payment Fund shall be invested in short-term obligations of the United
States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by
the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such investment, or any loss resulting from any such investment, shall affect
Parents obligation to pay the Merger Consideration and Option Consideration
in accordance with Section 2.1 and Section 2.2. The Payment Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all the
expenses of the Paying Agent

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

### other than any expenses customarily charged by the Paying Agent in
connection with lost, stolen or destroyed certificates.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Payment Procedures_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Paying Agent shall deliver:

  

#### 

  

##### (A) to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of (i) an
outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ") or (ii) shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), a letter of transmittal (" _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent
or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set
forth in the Letter of Transmittal, and which shall have such other
provisions as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in
the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such shares, for payment of
the Merger Consideration therefor.

  

##### 

  

##### (B) to each holder of a Company Stock Option (x) an option surrender
agreement (" _Option Surrender Agreement_ ") which shall be in such form and
have such provisions as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify; and
(y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Company Stock
Option in exchange for the Option Consideration.

  

##### 

  

#### (ii) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefore the Merger Consideration for each share formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares and such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall be paid
or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate and each Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this ARTICLE II.

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

#### (iii) Upon surrender of a Company Stock Option for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, together with the Option Surrender Agreement, duly executed,
and any other documents reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent, (A) the holder of the Company Stock Option shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefore the amount of cash which such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.2;
and (B) the Company Stock Option so surrendered shall be canceled. Until
surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.4, each
Company Stock Option shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Option
Consideration.

  

#### 

  

### (c) _Termination of Rights_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Company Common Stock, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporations
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the
Company on any such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and after the Effective Time there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this ARTICLE II.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) The surrender of a Company Stock Option in exchange for the Option
Consideration shall be deemed a release of any and all rights the holder had
or may have had in respect of such Company Stock Option. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all action necessary (including

### carry on its business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified and
in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the business it
is conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its properties,
makes such qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where
the failure so to qualify would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect (as
defined below). Parent and Merger Sub each has heretofore delivered to the
Company complete and correct copies of its Certificate of Incorporation or
Articles of Incorporation, as applicable, and Bylaws, each as amended to
date. " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " means any result, occurrence,
condition, fact, change, violation, event or effect that, individually or in

binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable in accordance

reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors rights and to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law). Parent, as the owner of all of the outstanding shares of
Merger Sub, has approved this Agreement and the Merger in its capacity as
sole stockholder of Merger Sub.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.2(b)_ of the disclosure
schedule dated as of the date of this Agreement and delivered by Parent and
Merger Sub to the Company on or prior to the date of this Agreement (the "
_Parent Disclosure Schedule_ "), the execution and delivery of this Agreement
does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
compliance with the provisions hereof will not, conflict with, or result in
any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any material obligation or to the loss of a material benefit
under, or give rise to a right of purchase under, or result in the creation
of any Encumbrance upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or Merger
Sub under, or otherwise result in a material detriment to Parent or Merger
Sub under, any provision of (A) the Certificate of Incorporation or Articles
of Incorporation, as applicable, or Bylaws of Parent or Merger Sub, (B) any

its ultimate parent under the HSR Act and the expiration or termination of
the applicable waiting period with respect thereto; (B) the filing with the

and the other transactions contemplated hereby; (C) the filing of the

expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

  

#### 

  

### (c) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent, its Affiliates or its representatives for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or any other document filed

it is first published, sent or given to the Companys stockholders or the
Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under

facts that are likely to give rise to any Parent Litigation, in each case,
that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, nor
is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental
Entity or arbitrator outstanding against Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent
that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect the ability of the
Company or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Financing_. True, correct and complete copies of the debt commitment
letter dated August 18, 2005 from Merrill Lynch Capital, a division of
Merrill Lynch Business Financial Services Inc., and the supplemental letter

(collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") and the equity commitment
letter dated August 31, 2005 from the Guarantors and Infinity Associates LLC
(the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ ," and with the Debt Commitment Letter, the

of which are in full force and effect. The aggregate proceeds

  



  

28   

     
   

  



  

### contemplated by the Commitment Letters, if and when funded in accordance
with the Commitment Letters, together with the available cash of the Company,
will be sufficient for Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration, the aggregate Option Consideration, any
repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in the Commitment Letters, all
payments required under Section 5.5 hereof and the fees and expenses incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. The obligation
of the financing sources to fund the commitments under the Debt Commitment
Letter is not subject to any conditions other than as set forth in or
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter. The obligation of the financing
sources to fund under the Equity Commitment Letter is not subject to any
conditions other than as set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter and
conditions customary for transactions of this nature. As of the date of
this Agreement, no event has occurred that (with or without notice, lapse of
time, or both) would constitute a breach or default under the Equity
Commitment Letter by Parent or Merger Sub. Parent has no knowledge of any
facts or circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in (i) any of the
conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters not being satisfied to the
extent such conditions can be satisfied by, or are under the control of,
Parent or Merger Sub or (ii) the funding contemplated in the Commitment
Letters not being made available to Parent on a timely basis in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Solvency; Surviving Corporation After the Merger_. Neither Parent
nor Merger Sub is entering into the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present
or future creditors. Assuming that the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in this Agreement are true and correct in all material
respects, at and immediately after the Effective Time, and after giving
effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
the Surviving Corporation (i) will be solvent (in that both the fair value
of its assets will not be less than the sum of its debts and that the present
fair saleable value of its assets will not be less than the amount required
to pay its probable liability on its debts as they become absolute and
matured); (ii) will have adequate capital and liquidity with which to engage
in its business; and (iii) will not have incurred and does not plan to incur
debts beyond its ability to pay as they become absolute and matured.

  

### 

  

### (g) _Vote/Approval Required_. No vote or consent of the holders of any
class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this
Agreement or the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby. The vote or
consent of Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub is the only vote or
consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Merger Sub
necessary to approve this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

###

incorporated on August 29, 2005. Since their respective inception,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub has engaged in any activity, other than such
actions in connection with (i) its organization; (ii) in the case of Parent,
the purchase of all of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub; and (iii)
the preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the

receives an unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal with respect
to itself from a third party (under circumstances in which the Company has
complied with its obligations under this Section 4.2) that its Board of
Directors has in good faith concluded (following the receipt of the advice of

of Directors, following the receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel,
determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would be a
violation of its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under

that expressly permit the Company to comply with the provisions of this
Section 4.2) and (C) contemporaneously with furnishing any nonpublic
information to such third party, it furnishes such nonpublic information to
Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously so
furnished); (ii) engage in negotiations with the third party with respect to
the Acquisition Proposal, provided that at least 24 hours prior to entering

in response to an unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal, to
approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any such
Acquisition Proposal and, in connection therewith, to withdraw, modify or
change in a manner adverse to Parent the Recommendations, but only if:

  

### 

  

#### (i) the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith after
consultation with its financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, and following the receipt of advice of its
outside legal counsel, determines in good faith

  



  

35   

     
   

  



  

#### that the failure to take such action would be a violation of its
fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable law,

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) the Company has delivered to Parent a written notice (a " _Notice
of Superior Proposal_ ") that advises Parent that the Company has received a
Superior Proposal, summarizes the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal and attaches a complete copy of such Superior Proposal, and
identifies the person making such Superior Proposal (it being agreed and
understood that any subsequent amendments or modifications to such Superior
Proposal shall again be subject to the provisions of this subparagraph), and

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) either (x) on or before the expiration of the three business day
period following the delivery to Parent of any Notice of Superior Proposal,
Parent does not make a written offer (a " _Matching Bid_ ") in response to
such Superior Proposal, or (y) following receipt of a Matching Bid within the
three business day period following delivery to Parent of any Notice of
Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, after taking into consideration the Matching Bid, that the Superior
Proposal to which the Notice of Superior Proposal relates continues to be a
Superior Proposal.

  

#### 

  

Any action pursuant to this Section 4.2(d) shall not constitute a breach of

in this Agreement.

  



  

### (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent required
by applicable law.

  

### 

  

### (f) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing solicitation, initiation, encouragement, activity, discussion or
negotiation with any parties conducted heretofore by the Company or any of
its representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall promptly request that each person who has received confidential
information about the Company in connection with that persons consideration
of an Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all such information.

  

### 

  

### (g) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following meanings: (i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry,
offer or proposal relating to any transaction or series of related
transactions involving: (A) any purchase from the Company or acquisition by
any person, entity or "Group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of more than a twenty
percent (20%) interest in the total outstanding voting securities of the

any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
involving the Company, (B) any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course
of business), exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course
of business), acquisition or disposition of more than twenty percent (20%) of

other aspects of the proposal and the person, entity or Group making the
proposal, to be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the
Companys stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders) than the terms
of the Merger and is reasonably capable of being consummated.

5.1 _Preparation of Proxy Statement_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall promptly prepare and the Company shall file with the SEC the
preliminary Proxy Statement for use in connection with the solicitation of
proxies from the Companys stockholders in connection with the Merger and the
Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall
furnish such preliminary Proxy Statement to Parent for review before such
filing with the SEC and that such filing shall be subject to Parents prior
approval of the preliminary Proxy Statement, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Subject to Section 4.2(d), the
Proxy Statement shall include a description of the determinations and
approvals, and shall include the Recommendations, of the Companys Board of
Directors. The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall notify Parent of
the receipt of any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement
and of any requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for
additional information and shall provide to Parent promptly copies of all
correspondence between the Company or any representative of the Company and
the SEC. As promptly as practicable after comments are received from the SEC
with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company, Parent and the
Merger Sub shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to the
comments of the SEC. The Company shall give Parent and its counsel the
opportunity to review all amendments and supplements to the Proxy
Statement and all responses to requests for additional information and
replies to comments of the SEC prior to their being filed with or sent to the
SEC, and the filing of such shall be subject to Parents prior approval,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  Parent shall
promptly provide the Company with such information as may be required to be
included in the Proxy Statement or as may be reasonably required to respond
to any comment of the SEC.  After all the comments received from the SEC have
been cleared by the SEC staff and all information required to be contained in
the Proxy Statement has been included therein by the Company (or, in the
event the SEC has informed the Company that it will not review the
preliminary Proxy Statement, then as promptly as practicable following the
tenth (10th) day following the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement),
the Company shall file the definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC and cause
the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders of record, as of the
record date established by the Board of Directors of the Company, as promptly
as practicable thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board of
Directors of the Company withdraws, modifies or changes the
Recommendations in accordance with

  



  

37   

     
   

  



  

Section 4.2(d) so as not to recommend this Agreement or the Merger, upon the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(c)(i)
or Section 7.1(d)(i), the Company shall not be required to comply with
the provisions of this Section 5.1.

  



  

5.2 _Access to Information_. Until the Closing, the Company shall afford to
Parent and its representatives (including accountants and counsel) reasonable
and direct access (in each case, only at such locations and in accordance
with such procedures regarding prior notice and the time and duration of
access as are mutually agreed to between Parent and the Company prior to any
such access, it being agreed and understood that access to any directors,
officers and employees in accordance with such mutually agreed procedures
shall be granted without the supervision of a representative of the Company
if so requested by Parent) to all properties, books, records, files, Tax
Returns and directors, officers, employees and counsel of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries ( _provided_   _that_ Parent and its representatives
shall not have access for purposes of conducting any environmental sampling
or testing) and all other information with respect to their respective
businesses, together with the opportunity, at the sole cost and expense of
Parent, to make copies of such books, records and other documents and to
discuss the business of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries with such
directors, officers, employees and counsel for the Company as Parent may
reasonably request for the purposes of familiarizing itself with the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries. Parent and its representatives shall use their
reasonable commercial efforts to conduct any such activities in such a manner
as not to interfere with the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or otherwise cause any interference with the prompt and
timely discharge by the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries of
their normal duties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not have
access to personnel records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
relating to medical histories.  Parent agrees that it will not, and will
cause its respective representatives not to, use any information obtained
pursuant to this Section 5.2 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Confidentiality Agreement dated as of May 9, 2005 between Parent and Bear,
Stearns and Co. Inc., for itself and on behalf of the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), shall (subject to Section 7.5) continue to
apply with respect to information furnished thereunder or hereunder and any
other activities contemplated thereby.

  



  

5.3 _Stockholders Meeting_. The Company will take all action necessary in
accordance with the NRS and its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to
call, hold and convene as promptly as practicable a meeting of its
stockholders to consider adoption of the Merger and this Agreement (the "
_Stockholders  Meeting_"). The Company will solicit from its stockholders
proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, and will
take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of
its stockholders required by the rules of the Nasdaq or the NRS to obtain such
approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Stockholders Meeting to
the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to
the Proxy Statement is provided to its stockholders in advance of a vote on
the Merger and this Agreement or, if as of the time for which the
Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
the business of such Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall ensure that its

  



  

38   

     
   

  



  

Stockholders Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and
that all proxies solicited by it in connection with the Stockholders Meeting
are solicited in compliance with the NRS, its Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws, the rules of the Nasdaq and all other applicable legal requirements.
The Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend that the Companys
stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve the Merger and this
Agreement at the Stockholders Meeting (the " _Recommendations_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board of Directors of the Company
withdraws, modifies or changes the Recommendations in accordance with Section
4.2(d) so as not to recommend this Agreement or the Merger, upon the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(c)(i) or Section
7.1(d)(i), the Company shall not be obligated to take any action otherwise
required pursuant to this Section 5.3, and the Company may cancel any
scheduled stockholders meeting.

  



  

5.4 _HSR and Other Approvals_.

  



  

(a) Except for the filings and notifications made pursuant to applicable
Antitrust Laws, to which Sections 5.4(b) and 5.4(c), and not this Section
5.4(a), shall apply, promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the
parties shall proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate Governmental
Entities such authorizations, consents, notifications, certifications,
registrations, declarations and filings that are necessary in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall
diligently and expeditiously prosecute, and shall cooperate fully with each
other in the prosecution of, such matters.

  

### 

  

### (b) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, but in no event
later than ten Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the
parties shall file, or cause to be filed by their respective "ultimate parent
entities," with the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_
") the notifications and other information (if any) required to be filed
under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company shall fully cooperate with each
other and shall furnish to the other such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with
its preparation of any filing or submission which is necessary under the HSR
Act. Parent and the Company shall keep each other apprised of the status of
any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional
information from, the FTC or the Antitrust Division.  Parent shall take
whatever action is necessary to prevent the FTC, Antitrust Division, or other
Governmental Entity, as the case may be, from filing action with a court or
Governmental Entity, which, if the Governmental Entity prevailed, would
restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the Merger, including an agreement to (i) sell or otherwise dispose of, or
hold separate and agree to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories
of assets or businesses of the Company or Parent or eithers respective
Subsidiaries; (ii) terminate existing relationships and contractual rights
and obligations of the Company or Parent or eithers respective Subsidiaries;
(iii) terminate any relevant venture or other arrangement; or (iv) effectuate
any other change or restructuring of the Company or Parent (and, in each
case, to enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an order or
decree or file appropriate applications with the FTC, the Antitrust Division
or other Governmental Entity) (each a " _Divestiture Action_ "). In the event
any action is threatened or instituted challenging the Merger as violative of
the HSR

  



  

39   

     
   

  



  

### Act, the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, as amended, the Clayton Act of
1914, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, as amended, or
any other applicable law designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
for the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
(collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "), Parent shall take such action,
including any Divestiture Action, as may be necessary to avoid, resist or
resolve such action. Parent shall be entitled to direct any proceedings or
negotiations with any Governmental Entity relating to any of the foregoing,
provided that it shall afford the Company a reasonable opportunity to
participate therein. In addition, Parent shall take such action as may be
required by any federal or state court of the United States, in any action
brought by a Governmental Entity or any other person challenging the Merger
as violative of the Antitrust Laws, including any Divestiture Action, in
order to avoid the entry of any permanent injunction or other permanent order
which would restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent the consummation of the
Merger, and in the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or
other order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any
proceeding that would make consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would
restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall take promptly
any and all steps necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or
order so as to permit such consummation prior to the Termination Date.

  

### 

  

### (c) From the date of this Agreement through the date of termination of
the required waiting period under the HSR Act, Parent and Merger Sub shall
not take any action that could reasonably be expected to hinder or delay the
obtaining of clearance or the expiration of the required waiting period under
the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Law.

  

### 

  

5.5 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

### (a) Parent shall take such action as may be necessary so that on and
after the Effective Time, and for one year thereafter, officers and employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries who remain after the Closing in the
employ of the Company or its Subsidiaries are provided employee benefits,
plans and programs which, in the aggregate, are not materially less favorable
than those made available by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such
officers and employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and listed on
_Schedule 3.1(l)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, except that Parent
will have no obligation to maintain any equity compensation programs after
the Effective Time and, therefore, the assessment of the aggregate value of
the employee benefits, plans and programs prior to the Effective Time shall
not take into consideration any equity compensation programs.  For purposes
of eligibility to participate and vesting in all benefits provided by Parent
to such officers and employees, the officers and employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries will be credited with their years of service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries and any predecessors thereof to the extent
service with Parent and its Subsidiaries and any predecessors thereof is
taken into account under the plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries. The
eligibility of any officer or employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
participate in any welfare benefit plan or program of Parent shall not be
subject to any exclusions for any pre-existing conditions if such individual
has met the participation requirements of similar benefit plans and programs
of the Company and its Subsidiaries.  All individuals eligible to participate
in any plan or

  



  

40   

     
   

  



  

### arrangement contemplated above shall be immediately eligible to
participate in the similar plan or arrangement maintained by Parent or its
Subsidiaries (or the same plan or arrangement if still maintained).  Amounts
paid before the Effective Time by officers and employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries under any health plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries
shall, after the Effective Time, be taken into account in applying deductible
and out-of-pocket limits applicable under the health plans of Parent provided
as of the Effective Time to the same extent as if such amounts had been paid
under such health plans of Parent.  Nothing contained in this Section 5.5(a)
shall (i) create any rights in any officer or employee or former officer or
employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation in respect of continued
employment for any specified period of any nature or kind whatsoever or (ii)
require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to provide benefits beyond the
period required under the terms of any employee benefits, plans or programs.

  

### 

  

### (b) After the Effective Time, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and each
of their respective Subsidiaries are and shall remain liable for, and Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and each of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
responsible for and shall promptly discharge, all liabilities, duties and
claims (to or by any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries employees or
former employees, any beneficiary under any Employee Benefit Plan, any
Governmental Entity or otherwise) arising out of or relating to the
employment relationship between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
their respective employees and former employees, including liabilities,
duties and claims (i) for deferred compensation, incentive compensation,
retirement benefits, health and life benefits, severance arrangements and
benefits, disability benefits and other benefits under any Employee Benefit
Plan, fund, program, arrangement, policy or practice, (ii) relating to
continuation health coverage pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code and Title
I, Subtitle B, Part 6 of ERISA and (iii) for unemployment and workers
compensation or similar benefits. After the Effective Time, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and each of their respective Subsidiaries shall file
any and all annual reports, filings or notices that may be required in
connection with any Employee Benefit Plan to be filed with
Governmental Entities or provided to participants and beneficiaries after the
Closing.

  

### 

  

### (c) At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall assume, and
perform pursuant to, each of the severance benefit plans described in
_Schedule 5.5(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule in the same manner and
to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform pursuant to
such plans if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement had not been
consummated; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that for a period equal to twelve
months, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors shall not
terminate or otherwise amend such plans in a manner adverse to any employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries covered by such plans immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (d) At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall assume, and
perform pursuant to, the SERP and each of the employment agreements and
retention agreements described on _Schedule 5.5(d)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

  

### 

  

### (e) No later than three business days prior to the Closing Date, Parent
shall deliver a written notice (the " _Termination Notice_ ") to the Company
of the names of the employees

  



  

41   

     
   

  



  

### of the Company and its Subsidiaries whose employment shall be terminated
by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date
whose names are listed on _Schedule 5.5(e)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. At the Effective Time, Parent shall pay by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to accounts designated prior to the
Closing by the Company (subject to all applicable withholding taxes) the
amounts set forth in the columns entitled "Severance Payment Amount" and
"Retention Payment Amount" opposite each persons name on _Schedule 5.5(e)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule that is listed in the Termination
Notice, and shall pay or cause the Company to pay the employer portion of any
Medicare, Social Security or unemployment Taxes payable by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in respect of such cash payments; _provided_ _that_
any person listed in the Termination Notice who has a "Retention Payment
Amount" listed opposite his name shall only be entitled to receive such
payment at the Effective Time if such person is employed by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or if
such persons employment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
terminated for Good Reason (as defined in the Companys Executive Retention
Plan) prior to the Effective Time. If a persons name is listed on the
Termination Notice, and such person is employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, such person shall
be deemed to have been terminated for Good Reason (as defined in the
Companys Executive Retention Plan).

  

### 

  

### (f) No later than three business days prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a written schedule setting forth (i) the
amounts payable pursuant to the SERP as a result of the consummation of the
Merger and/or a termination of employment; and (ii) the accounts (including
any trust accounts established pursuant to the SERP) to which the
aforementioned amounts shall be payable at the Effective Time.  At the
Effective Time, Parent shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the accounts designated by the Company (subject to all applicable
withholding taxes) the amounts set forth in such schedule delivered pursuant
to this Section 5.5(f), and shall pay or cause the Company to pay the
employer portion of any Medicare, Social Security or unemployment
Taxes payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of such
cash payments.

  

### 

  

### (g) The Company shall take such action, prior to the Effective Time,
necessary to obtain from each individual who has entered into an Employee
Agreement with the Company a release in a form reasonably acceptable to
Parent acknowledging the accuracy of the Companys representations in Section
3.1(l)(i)(E) with respect to such individual and that the individual agrees
that he or she is not entitled to any payment not specifically set forth on
_Schedule 3.1(l)(v)(A)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

### 

  

5.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

  



  

### (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any DandO Indemnified
Person (as defined below) may have pursuant to any employment agreement,
indemnification agreement or otherwise, from and after the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective
Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who
acts as a fiduciary under any Employee Benefit

### Plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _D andO Indemnified
Persons_") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including
attorneys and other professionals fee and expenses), liabilities or
judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement with the approval of the
indemnifying party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) of or
in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part
out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, a fiduciary under any
Employee Benefit Plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was
serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or
other enterprise or by reason of anything done or not done by such person in
any such capacity whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or
existing prior to, at or after the Effective Time and whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (" _D andO Indemnified
Liabilities_"), including all DandO Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or
in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law (and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, jointly and severally, pay expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation to each DandO Indemnified Person to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law, provided that such DandO Indemnified
Person provides an undertaking to repay such expenses if such person is
determined to not be entitled to indemnification).  Without limiting the
foregoing, in the event any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation is brought against any DandO Indemnified Persons (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time), (i) the DandO Indemnified Persons may
retain the Companys regularly engaged independent legal counsel or other
counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the DandO Indemnified
Persons as promptly as statements therefor are received and (ii) Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall use their reasonable commercial efforts to
assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter, provided that neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld).  Any DandO Indemnified Person wishing to claim
indemnification under this Section 5.6(a), upon learning of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify the Surviving
Corporation (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a party from any
liability that it may have under this Section 5.6(a) except to the extent
such failure materially prejudices such partys position with respect to such
claims) and shall deliver to Parent and the Surviving Corporation any
undertaking required by applicable law, but without any requirement for the
posting of a bond or any other terms or conditions other than those expressly
set forth herein.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification
than are presently set forth in the Companys Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws. For a period of 6 years following the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify the
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation in any
manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who
at and at any time prior to the Effective Time were entitled
to indemnification thereunder (unless such amendment, repeal or modification
is

  



  

43   



  

      
  

  



  

### required by applicable law). Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor any indemnification agreements between the Company and
any of its directors, officers or employees.

  

### 

  

### (c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify any DandO
Indemnified Person against all reasonable costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses), such amounts to be payable in advance upon
request as provided in Section 5.6(a) (including the undertaking required
therein), relating to the enforcement of such DandO Indemnified Persons rights
under this Section 5.6 or under any charter, bylaw or contract regardless of
whether such DandO Indemnified Person is ultimately determined to be entitled
to indemnification hereunder or thereunder.

  

### 

  

### (d) Parent agrees that the Company will cause to be put in place
immediately prior to the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a
claims period of at least six years from the Effective Time from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys
existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _that_ Parent shall not be required to
expend in the aggregate in connection with the purchase of such tail coverage
an amount in excess of three **** times the Companys current annual premium
for such coverage (and to the extent such coverage shall exceed such amount,
Parent shall obtain the maximum amount of coverage as is available for such
amount).

  

### 

  

### (e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.6. The
provisions of this Section 5.6 are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, the parties hereto and each person entitled to
indemnification or insurance coverage or expense advancement pursuant to this
Section 5.6, and his heirs and representatives. The Surviving Corporation
shall not, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to, sell,
transfer, distribute or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to render the Surviving Corporation unable
to satisfy its obligations under this Section 5.6 unless proper provisions
are made for Parent or the transferee of such assets to assume the Surviving
Corporations obligations hereunder.

this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of
any failure of such party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect

5.11 _Investigation and Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub; No Other
Representations or Warranties_.

  



  

### (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that it has
made its own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed
an independent judgment concerning, the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their businesses and operations, and Parent and Merger Sub have requested
such documents and information from the Company as each such party considers
material in determining whether to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that it has had an opportunity to ask all
questions of and receive answers from the Company with respect to any matter
such party considers material in determining whether to enter into this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.
In connection with Parents and Merger Subs investigation of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and their businesses and operations, Parent, Merger Sub and
their representatives have received from the Company or its representatives
certain projections and other forecasts for the Company and its Subsidiaries
and certain estimates, plans and budget information. To the knowledge of
the Company, such projections, forecasts, estimates, plans, and budget
information with respect to any period or periods up to and including
December 31, 2005, were prepared in good faith and were based on reasonable
assumptions given the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
other business factors. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees
that there are uncertainties inherent in such projections, forecasts,
estimates, plans and budgets; that Parent and Merger Sub are familiar with
such uncertainties; that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility
for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all
estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to them or
their representatives; and that Parent and Merger Sub will not (and
will cause all of their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates or any
other person acting on their behalf to not) assert any claim or cause of
action against the Company or any of the Companys direct or indirect
partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, stockholders, Affiliates,

the foregoing, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, each of
Parent and Merger Sub agrees that neither the Company, any holder of the
Companys securities nor any of their respective

  



  

46   

     
   

  



  

### Affiliates or representatives, makes or has made any representation or
warranty to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their representatives or Affiliates

### 

  

#### (i) any projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets of future
revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any
component thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future

Subsidiaries or the future business, operations or affairs of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made
available to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective representatives or
Affiliates; or

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) any other information, statement or documents heretofore or
hereafter delivered to or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their

information, statements and documents so provided are, in all material
respects, complete and accurate copies of what they purport to be.

  

####

seek Alternative Financing pursuant to Section 5.16, to the lender under the
Alternative Financing (the " _Solvency Letter_ ") to be delivered to the
Company and the Companys Board of Directors, with such Solvency Letter
either being expressly addressed to such persons or being in such form and
manner as may be required in order that such persons shall be entitled to
rely upon such Solvency Letter as if such Solvency Letter were expressly
addressed to such persons.

  



  

5.13 _No Control of Other Party s Business_.  Except for any consents
contemplated by this Agreement to be required in order for the Company to
take certain specified actions, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
Companys or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective Time, and
except for consents contemplated by this Agreement to be required in order
for Parent to take certain specified actions, nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct Parents or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent
shall exercise, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries
respective operations.

  



  

5.14 _Audit_. As promptly as practicable following September 30, 2005, the

statement of operations and comprehensive income and consolidated statement
of cash flows, and notes thereto), as of and for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2005 (such actions, the " _Year End Audit_ ").  Prior to
September 30, 2005, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to take such actions to prepare for the Year End Audit as may be advisable in
order for the Year End Audit to be completed as promptly as practicable.

  



  

47   

     
   

  



  

5.15 _Rights Plan_. Except with respect to entering into the amendment to
the Company Rights Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, which
amendment shall not be rescinded or further amended without the consent of
Parent, the Company shall not redeem the Company Rights or amend or modify or
terminate the Company Rights Agreement, or determine any offer to be a
"Complying Offer" thereunder other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

5.16 _Financing_. Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the debt financing under the Debt Commitment Letter, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to (a) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the financing set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (including by consummating the financing
pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter), and (b) enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or on other terms and conditions
that in the aggregate are not materially less favorable to Parent. In the
event that any portion of the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter will not be available to Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall (a) promptly notify the Company
of such fact and (b) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
alternate financing for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
provided that the terms and conditions of such alternate financing in the
aggregate are not materially less favorable to Parent than those contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Alternative Financing_ "). The Company
shall cause its senior management to cooperate with all reasonable requests
by Parent in connection with such efforts by Parent, including causing such
persons to attend meetings with prospective members of and participants in
any syndicate of financial institutions being assembled to provide such
financing; provided that (a) any expenses incurred by the Company and its
senior management in connection with such cooperation will be paid by Parent
promptly upon request, and (b) such cooperation will not materially interfere
with the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The parties will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any debt evidenced by item 1 in
_Schedule 3.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule to be paid in full, all
letters of credit evidenced thereby to be either terminated or cash
collateralized and all commitments to lend thereunder to be terminated as of
the Closing, in each case, to the extent necessary or desirable in order
to cause the condition in Section 6.2(d) to be satisfied.

### (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by any party hereto as
provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of any party hereto except
with respect to this Section 7.2, the last two sentences of Section 5.2,
clause (a) of the last sentence of Section 5.16, Section 7.5 and ARTICLE
VIII; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such termination shall relieve any
party from liability for breach of any term or provision hereof.

  

### 

  

### (b) If (x) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i)
or (y) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i),
then the Company shall pay Parent a fee of $7,000,000 (the " _Termination
Fee_ ") in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Parent. If the Termination Fee shall be payable pursuant to

  



  

52   

     
   

  



  

### clause (x) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Termination Fee
shall be paid no later than one business day after the date of termination of
this Agreement, and if the Termination Fee shall be payable pursuant to
clause (y) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Termination Fee shall
be paid on the date of termination of this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (c) If (x) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii) or Section 7.1(b)(iii), (y) there shall have
been a publicly announced Acquisition Proposal (other than the Merger) prior
to such termination and (z) within 12 months after the date of
such termination, the Company consummates an Acquisition Proposal or enters
into a definitive agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than
the Merger), then within one business day after the demand of Parent
following any such event, the Company shall pay Parent an amount equal to the
Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Parent.

  

### 

  

### (d) In the event the Termination Fee shall be payable, Parent shall be
entitled to receive from the Company (in addition to the Termination Fee) its
documented fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement (not
to exceed $1,000,000) within one business day after the demand of Parent
after such event by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Parent. If this Agreement shall have been terminated by
Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iv) or Section 7.1(c)(ii) or
Section 7.1(d)(ii), then the terminating party shall be entitled to
receive, in addition to any damages to which it may be entitled, from
the non-terminating party its documented fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement (not to exceed $1,000,000) within one business
day after the demand of the terminating party after such event by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
terminating party.

  

### 

  

### (e) If the Company or Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(b)(iii) and at the time of such termination the conditions set
forth in Section 6.1, Section 6.2 (other than Section 6.2(d)) and Section 6.3
have been satisfied or waived (assuming for purposes of reading the
provisions in Section 6.1, Section 6.2 and Section 6.3 that the "Closing
Date" is the Termination Date), then Parent shall pay to the Company no later
than one business day after the date of termination of this Agreement a fee
of $7,000,000 in cash plus the Companys documented fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement (not to exceed $1,000,000) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Company; _provided_  that if the condition set forth in Section 6.2(d) is not
satisfied solely because of the failure of a condition that is specifically
described in the Debt Commitment Letter to be satisfied or because of the
failure of a condition to the Alternative Financing to be satisfied (in each
case, other than the funding under the Equity Commitment Letter), then no
amount shall be payable pursuant to this Section 7.2(e).

  

### 

  

### (f) In no event shall Parent be entitled to receive more than one payment
of the Termination Fee. Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without
these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if

  



  

53   

     
   

  



  

### either Parent or the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts
due pursuant to this Section 7.2, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent or the Company, as applicable, makes a claim that results in a
judgment against the party that failed to pay the amounts set forth in this
Section 7.2, the party that failed to pay shall pay to the other party its
reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in
this Section 7.2 at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made. Payment of the fees and expenses
described in this Section 7.2 shall be applied against any damages incurred
in the event of a breach of this Agreement (which damages will be calculated
without taking into account such offset for fees and expenses described in
this Section 7.2).

  

### 

  

7.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the
stockholders of the Company, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall
be made which by law requires further approval by such stockholders without
first obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

  



  

7.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed: (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party.

  



  

7.5 _Return of Information_.  Within ten business days following termination
of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1, Parent shall, and shall
cause Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates and representatives to,
return to the Company, or destroy, all Evaluation Material (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) furnished or made available to Parent and Merger
Sub and their respective Affiliates and representatives by or on behalf of
the Company, and all analyses, compilations, data, studies, notes,
interpretations, memoranda or other documents prepared by Parent or Merger
Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or representatives (including
electronic copies thereof) that refer to, relate to, discuss or contain, or
are based on, in whole or in part, any such Evaluation Material. Parent shall
deliver a certificate signed by its Chief Executive Officer, which
certificate shall provide evidence reasonably substantiating the return or
destruction of the Evaluation Material as required under this Section 7.5.

8.4 _Rules of Construction_.

  



  

### (a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that it has been represented
by independent counsel of its choice throughout all negotiations that have
preceded the execution of this Agreement and that it has executed the same
with consent and upon the advice of said independent counsel. Each party and
its counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement and
the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto
exchanged between the parties shall be deemed the work product of the parties
and may not be construed against any party by reason of its preparation.
Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would require
interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against any party that
drafted it is of no application and is hereby expressly waived.

  



  

56   

     
   

  



  

The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent
Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in
and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in
the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable,
that such items are material to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the
case may be. The headings, if any, of the individual sections of each of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule and Company Disclosure Schedule are inserted for
convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a
part of this Agreement. The Company Disclosure Schedule and Parent Disclosure
Schedule are arranged in sections corresponding to those contained in Section
3.1, Section 3.2, Section 4.1 and Section 5.5 merely for convenience, and the
disclosure of an item in one section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or
Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a particular representation or
warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to
all other representations or warranties to the extent that the relevance of
such item to such representations or warranties is reasonably apparent on the
face of such item, notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate
section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule with
respect to such other representations or warranties or an appropriate cross-
reference thereto.

  



  

### (b) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule is not intended and shall not be
deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such
amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy
between the parties to determine whether any obligation, item or matter
(whether or not described herein or included in any schedule) is or is not
material for purposes of this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (c) All references in this Agreement to Exhibits, Schedules, Articles,
Sections, subsections and other subdivisions refer to the corresponding
Exhibits, Schedules, Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions
of this Agreement unless expressly provided otherwise. Titles appearing at
the beginning of any Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions of
this Agreement are for convenience only, do not constitute any part of
such Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions, and shall be
disregarded in construing the language contained therein.  The words "this
Agreement," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof and words of similar
import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
subdivision unless expressly so limited. The words "this Section," "this
subsection" and words of similar import, refer only to the Sections or
subsections hereof in which such words occur. The word "including" (in its
various forms) means "including, without limitation." The word "person" shall
mean any individual, corporation, partnership or other entity, organization
or enterprise. Pronouns in masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall be
construed to state and include any other gender and words, terms and titles
(including terms defined herein) in the singular form shall be construed to
include the plural and vice versa, unless the context otherwise expressly
requires. Unless the context otherwise requires, all defined terms contained
herein shall include the singular and plural and the conjunctive and
disjunctive forms of such defined terms. Unless the context
otherwise requires, all references to a specific time shall refer to Dallas,
Texas time.

  



  

57   

     
   

  



  

8.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when two or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that
all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

  



  

8.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(together with the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, the Confidentiality Agreement and any other documents and
instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. The provisions of
Sections 5.5 and 5.6 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the persons referred to therein and their respective heirs
and representatives. Except as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence, this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any person other than
the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

  



  

8.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
the principles of conflicts of law thereof (other than with respect to issues
relating to fiduciary duties, general corporation law and any other
provisions set forth herein that are required to be governed by the NRS).

  



  

8.8 _Severability_. Each party agrees that, should any court or other
competent authority hold any provision of this Agreement or part hereof to be
null, void or unenforceable, or order any party to take any action
inconsistent herewith or not to take an action consistent herewith or
required hereby, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions and obligations contained or set forth herein shall not in any way
be affected or impaired thereby, and a suitable and equitable provision shall
be substituted for such provision subject to such holding or order.
Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent that a
party hereto took an action inconsistent herewith or failed to take action
consistent herewith or required hereby pursuant to an order or judgment of a
court or other competent authority, such party shall not incur any liability
or obligation unless such party breached its obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement or did not in good faith seek to resist or object
to the imposition or entering of such order or judgment.

  



  

8.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

  



  

8.10 _Affiliate Liability_. Each of the following is herein referred to as a
" _Company Affiliate_ ": (a) any direct or indirect holder of equity
interests or securities in the Company (whether limited or general partners,
members, stockholders or otherwise), and (b) any director, officer, employee,
representative or agent of (i) the Company or (ii) any person who controls
the Company. Except to the extent that a Company Affiliate is an express
signatory thereto, absent fraud or intentional misrepresentation, no Company
Affiliate shall have any liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Sub of
any nature whatsoever in connection with or under this Agreement, the Stock

  



  

58   

     
   

  



  

Voting Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and
Parent and Merger Sub hereby waive and release all claims of any such
liability and obligation.

  



  

8.11 _Schedule Definitions_. All capitalized terms in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or Company Disclosure Schedule shall have the meanings ascribed to
them herein, unless the context otherwise requires or as otherwise defined.

  



  

8.12 _Joint Liability_. Each representation, warranty, covenant and
agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement shall be deemed a
representation, warranty, covenant and agreement made by Parent and Merger
Sub jointly and all liability and obligations relating thereto shall be
deemed a joint liability and obligation of Parent and Merger Sub.

  



  

8.13 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law of in equity.

  



  

8.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER
SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT HEREOF. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
