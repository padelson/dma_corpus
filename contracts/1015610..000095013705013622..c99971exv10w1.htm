therefor (reduced by any amount allocable to cash received as part of the Per Share
Consideration to a fractional share interest for which cash is received).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rendering such opinion, the Seller&#146;s counsel may require and rely upon representations and

therein not misleading (except that we do not comment with respect to the financial statements and
