 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of November 9, 2005 (the "Agreement"), between Gold Banc Corporation, Inc., a Kansas corporation (the "Seller"), and Marshall and Ilsley Corporation, a Wisconsin corporation (the "Company"). 

  

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company (the "Companys Board of Directors") and the Seller (the "Sellers Board of Directors") have each determined that it is advisable to and in the best interests of their respective stockholders for the Seller to merge with and into the Company (the "Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and in accordance with the Kansas General Corporation Code (the "KGCC") and the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law (the "WBCL"); 

  

 WHEREAS, the Companys Board of Directors and the Sellers Board of Directors have each approved the Merger of the Seller with and into the Company, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and approved and adopted this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, subsequent to the Sellers approval of this Agreement and concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a condition and an inducement to the willingness of the Company to enter into this Agreement, the Company has entered into a Stockholder Voting Agreement pursuant to which each stockholder listed on Schedule I to such Stockholder Voting Agreement has agreed to vote the shares of the Seller Common Stock beneficially owned by such stockholder in favor of the Merger; and 

  

 WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and this Agreement shall constitute the plan of reorganization. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I  THE MERGER 

   

 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the KGCC, the WBCL and the Plan of Merger attached hereto as  _Exhibit 1.1_, at the Effective Time the Seller shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Seller shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). 

  

 1.2 _The Closing; Effective Time_. 

  

 (a) The closing of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall be held at such time, date (the "Closing Date") and location as may be mutually agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Closing shall be held at the offices

of Godfrey and Kahn, S.C., 780 North Water Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
commencing at 9:00 a.m., Milwaukee time, on a date specified by either party
upon five (5) business days written notice (or at the election of the
Company on the last business day of the month) after the last to occur of the
following events: (a) receipt of all consents and approvals of government
Regulatory Authorities legally required to consummate the Merger and the
expiration of all statutory waiting periods; and (b) approval of this
Agreement and the Merger by the Sellers stockholders. Scheduling or
commencing the Closing shall not constitute a waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article VII by either the Company or the Seller. 

   

 (b) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger and articles of merger, as necessary, and any other required documents, with the Secretary of State of the State of Kansas (the "Kansas Secretary of State") and the Department of Financial Institutions of the State of Wisconsin (the "DFI"), in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the KGCC and the WBCL (the date and time of such filing or such date and time as the Company and the Seller shall agree and specify in the certificate of merger and articles of merger are referred to herein as the "Effective Time"). 

  

 1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the KGCC and the WBCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided herein, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and the Seller shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and the Seller shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.4 _Articles of Incorporation; By-Laws_. At the Effective Time, the Companys Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the "Company Articles"), and the Companys By-Laws, as amended (the "Company By-Laws"), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation and the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.5 _Directors and Officers_. At the Effective Time, the directors of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation and to be assigned to the class previously assigned, except that the Chief Executive Officer of the Seller shall be appointed to the Companys Board of Directors as soon as practicable after the Closing Date in accordance with Section 6.10 of this Agreement. At the Effective Time, the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed. 

  

 1.6 _Conversion of Securities; Dissenting Shares_. 

  

 (a) Subject to Section 1.6(d) regarding fractional shares, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without action on the part of the Company or the Seller, each share of the common stock, $1.00 par value, of the Seller ("Seller Common Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than shares of Seller Common Stock 

   ##### 

  

 

(i) held in the treasury of the Seller, (ii) owned by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary for its own account, and (iii) other than Dissenting
Shares (such shares of Seller Common Stock being referred to herein as
the "Shares"), shall cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Consideration. 

   

 (b) Each share of Seller Common Stock held by the Seller as treasury stock and each such share held by the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof as otherwise provided in this Section 1.6. 

  

 (c) For purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions shall apply: 

   

 (i) "Per Share Consideration" means (A) an amount in cash equal to $2.78 (the "Cash Amount"), plus (B) a number of shares of common stock, $1.00 par value, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") (rounded to the nearest ten thousandth of a share) (the "Stock Amount") determined as follows: 

   

 (A) If the Valuation Period Market Value is less than $36.40, the Stock Amount shall be equal to 0.4319 of a share of Company Common Stock; 

   

 (B) If the Valuation Period Market Value is equal to or greater than $36.40 but less than or equal to $49.24, the Stock Amount shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing $15.72 by the Valuation Period Market Value; 

   

 (C) If the Valuation Period Market Value is greater than $49.24, the Stock Amount shall be equal to 0.3192 of a share of Company Common Stock; and 

   

 (D) Plus, to the extent the Company elects to exercise its right under Section 8.1(k)(ii), below, the Additional Stock Amount. 

  

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Cash Amount may have to be reduced and the Stock Amount may have to be increased in accordance with Section 1.6(f), below. 

   

 (ii) "Valuation Period Market Value" means the average of the average daily high and low sale price per share of the Company Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") for the five (5) trading days ending on and including the third trading day preceding the Effective Time (as reported in an authoritative source). 

  

 (d) No fractional shares of Company Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. In lieu of a fractional share of Company Common Stock, the holder of any Shares who would otherwise be entitled to receive such fractional share (after taking into account all shares of Seller Common Stock delivered by such holder) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment, without interest and rounded up to the nearest whole cent, in an amount determined by multiplying the Valuation Period Market Value by the fraction of a share of Company Common Stock to which the holder would otherwise have been entitled. As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional share interests, 

   ##### 

  

 

the bank or trust company designated by the Company (the "Exchange Agent")
shall so notify the Company, and the Company shall deposit that amount with
the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to
the holders of fractional share interests, subject to and in accordance with
the terms of this Section 1.6. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Seller Common Stock which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by stockholders who have validly exercised appraisal rights available under Section 17-6712 of the KGCC (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Per Share Consideration in accordance with this Section 1.6, unless and until such holders shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their appraisal rights under the KGCC. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 17-6712 of the KGCC, if and to the extent applicable. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights, such holders shares of Seller Common Stock shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Per Share Consideration in accordance with this Section 1.6. The Seller shall give the Company (a) prompt notice of each and every notice of a stockholders intent to demand payment for the stockholders shares of Seller Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the KGCC and received by the Seller relating to rights to be paid the "fair value" of Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 17-6712 of the KGCC and (b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the KGCC. The Seller shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Company, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, offer to settle or settle, or approve any withdrawal of any demands for "fair value" under Section 17-6712 of the KGCC. 

  

 (f) If either the tax opinion referred to in Section 7.2(e) or the tax opinion referred to in Section 7.3(d) cannot be rendered because the counsel charged with providing such opinion reasonably determines that the Merger may not satisfy the continuity of interest requirements under applicable federal income tax principles relating to reorganizations under Section 368(a) of the Code, then the Company shall reduce the Cash Amount and correspondingly increase the Stock Amount to the minimum extent necessary to enable the relevant tax opinions to be rendered. 

  

 1.7 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. The Company shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, from time to time, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, for exchange in accordance with this Article I, through the Exchange Agent, the Per Share Consideration, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, if any, to be issued in exchange for Shares pursuant to this Article I (the "Exchange Fund"). Such deposits shall be made after the Effective Time as requested by the Exchange Agent in order for the Exchange Agent to promptly deliver the Per Share Consideration. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate representing ownership of Shares (a "Certificate" or "Certificates") whose Shares were converted into the 

   ##### 

  

 

right to receive the Per Share Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Per Share Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Per Share Consideration and any unpaid dividends and
distributions thereon as provided in this Article I, which such holder has
the right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to
the provisions of this Article I (after taking into account all Shares
then held by such holder), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Seller, a transferee may exchange
the Certificate representing such Shares for the Per Share Consideration and
any unpaid dividends and distributions thereon as provided in this Article I
if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer, and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by such person of
a bond in such amount as the Company may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it or the Exchange Agent with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Per Share Consideration and any unpaid
dividends and distributions thereon as provided in this Article I, which such
holder would have had the right to receive in respect of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
1.7, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Shares owned by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and Certificates representing
Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Per
Share Consideration and any unpaid dividends and distributions thereon as
provided in this Article I. 

   

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Company Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 1.6(d), until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Company Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional share of Company Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6(d) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Company Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Company Common Stock. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) _No Further Rights in the Shares_. The Per Share Consideration issued and paid upon conversion of the Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. 

  

 (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Seller for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Company, upon demand, and any former stockholders of the Seller who have not theretofore complied with this Article I shall thereafter look only to the Company to claim the Per Share Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Company Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to Company Common Stock, in each case without interest thereon, and subject to Section 1.7(g). Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any United States federal, state or local or any foreign government, or political subdivision thereof, or any multinational organization or authority or any authority, agency or commission entitled to exercise any administrative, executive, judicial, legislative, police, regulatory or taxing authority or power, any court or tribunal (or any department, bureau or division thereof), or any arbitrator or arbitral body (each a "Governmental Authority") shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (f) _No Liability_. Neither the Company nor the Seller shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any such Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash or other payment delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any Laws relating to Taxes and pay such withholding amount over to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Company or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Company or the Exchange Agent as the case may be. 

  

ARTICLE II  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER 

   

 Except as disclosed in the Seller SEC Reports or in the disclosure schedule (the "Seller Disclosure Schedule") delivered by Seller to the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (which schedule sets forth items of disclosure with specific reference to the particular Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information in the Seller Disclosure Schedule relates);  _provided_ , _however_ , that any information set forth in one section or subsection of the Seller Disclosure Schedule will be deemed to apply to each other Section or subsection of this Agreement to which its relevance is reasonably apparent, Seller hereby represents and warrants to the Company as follows: 

   #####

Each Seller Subsidiary that is a Kansas bank has been in existence and actively engaged in business for five or more years. 

  

 (b) Each of the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries has all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, consents, certificates, approvals and orders ("Seller Approvals") necessary to own, lease and operate their properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, including all required authorizations from the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.

 2.2 _Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws_. The Seller has heretofore furnished or made available to the Company a complete and correct copy of the Sellers Articles of Incorporation and the Sellers By-Laws, as amended or restated ("Seller Articles" and "Seller By-Laws," respectively), and the Articles of Incorporation and the By-Laws, or other organizational documents, as the case may be, of each Seller Subsidiary (the "Subsidiary Organizational Documents").

 2.5 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

Sections 17-1286 through 17-1298 and Sections 17-12,100 through 17-12,104 of the KGCC are inapplicable to the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger.

 (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Seller do not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Seller will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any domestic governmental or regulatory authority except (i) for applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), state securities or blue sky laws ("Blue Sky Laws"), the BHCA, the banking laws and regulations of the States of Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Florida (the "SBL"), regulations promulgated by the SBA, the filing and recordation of appropriate merger or other documents as required by the KGCC and WBCL, and prior notification filings with the Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act (the "HSR Act"), and (ii) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would not prevent or delay consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent the Seller from performing its obligations under this Agreement, and would not have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary are subject to any foreign Governmental Authority or foreign law. 

  

 2.6 _Compliance; Permits_. Neither the Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary is in conflict with, or in default or violation of, (i) any Law applicable to the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary or 

   #####

Seller or any Seller Subsidiary is a party or by which the Seller or
any Seller Subsidiary or its or any of their respective properties is bound
or affected, except for any such violations, conflicts or defaults which

 (a) The Seller and each Seller Subsidiary have filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed with (x) the SEC since December 31, 2002, and as of the date of this Agreement has delivered or made available to the Company (i) its Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively, (ii) all proxy statements relating to the Sellers meetings of stockholders (whether annual or special) held since December 31, 2002, (iii) all Reports on Form 8-K filed by the Seller with the SEC since December 31, 2002, (iv) all other reports or registration statements filed by the Seller with the SEC since December 31, 2002 and (v) all amendments and supplements to all such reports and registration statements filed by the Seller with the SEC since December 31, 2002 (collectively, the "Seller SEC Reports") and (y) the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the Kansas Office of the State Bank Commissioner, the Missouri Division of Finance, the Oklahoma Office of State Finance, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation and any other applicable federal or state securities or banking authorities (all such reports and statements are collectively referred to as the "Seller Reports"). The Seller Reports (i) were prepared in all material respects in accordance with the requirements of applicable Law and (ii) did not at the time they were filed, after giving effect to any amendment thereto filed prior to the date hereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that information as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) will be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. The parties agree that failure of the Sellers Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer to provide any certification required to be filed with any document filed in any Seller SEC Report shall constitute an event that has a Seller Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (b) Each of the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements (including, if applicable, any related notes thereto) contained in the Seller SEC Reports have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or required by reason of a concurrent change to GAAP) and each fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows and changes in financial position for the periods indicated, except (i) for any statement therein or omission therefrom which were corrected, amended or supplemented or otherwise disclosed or updated in a subsequent Seller SEC Report, and (ii) that any unaudited interim financial statements do not contain the footnotes required by GAAP, and were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments, which were not or are not expected to be material in amount, either individually or in the aggregate. The Seller has not had any dispute with any of its auditors regarding accounting matters or policies during any of its past three full fiscal years or during the 

   ##### 

  

 

current fiscal year-to-date requiring disclosure pursuant to Item 304 of
Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. To Sellers Knowledge, the Sellers
auditors will deliver to the Seller an unqualified audit opinion with respect
to the Sellers financial statements as of and for the year ended December
31, 2005, and unqualified opinions with respect to the effectiveness of the
Sellers internal controls and with respect to the assessment of management
of the Seller regarding the effectiveness of the Sellers internal
controls. 

   

 (c) The Seller has made available to the Company a complete copy of any amendments or modifications which are required to be filed with the SEC, but have not yet been filed with the SEC, to (i) the Seller SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, and (ii) contracts which previously have been filed by the Seller with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act and Exchange Act (together with the Seller SEC Reports, the "Seller SEC Documents"). The Seller has timely responded to all comment letters and other correspondence of the staff of the SEC relating to the SEC Documents, and the SEC has not advised the Seller that any final responses are inadequate, insufficient or otherwise non-responsive. The Seller has made available to the Company true, correct and complete copies of all correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and the Seller and any of the Seller Subsidiaries, on the other, occurring since January 1, 2002 and prior to the date hereof and will, reasonably promptly following the receipt thereof, make available to the Company any such correspondence sent or received after the date hereof. To Sellers Knowledge, none of the SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review or outstanding SEC comment. 

  

 (d) To Sellers Knowledge, the Seller and each of its officers and directors are in compliance with and have complied in all material respects with (A) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley"), including, without limitation, Section 404 thereof, and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder and (B) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of The Nasdaq National Market ("Nasdaq"). With respect to each Report on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and each amendment of any such report filed by the Seller with the SEC since December 31, 2002, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Seller have made all certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of Sarbanes-Oxley and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder at the time of such filing, and the statements contained in each such certification were true and correct when made. Further, the Seller has established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably designed to ensure that material information (both financial and non-financial) relating to the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries required to be disclosed by the Seller in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Sellers principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of the Seller required by Section 302 of Sarbanes-Oxley with respect to such reports. For purposes of this agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in Sarbanes-Oxley. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) The Seller has established and maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) ("internal controls"). To Sellers Knowledge, based on its evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, such internal controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Sellers financial reporting and the preparation of the Sellers financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Seller has disclosed, based on its evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, to the Sellers auditors and audit committee (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses known to the Seller in the design or operation of internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in a material respect the Sellers ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any material fraud known to the Seller that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in internal controls. The Seller has made available to the Company a summary of any such disclosure regarding material weaknesses and fraud made by management to the Sellers auditors and audit committee since December 31, 2002. For purposes of this agreement, a "significant deficiency" in controls means a control deficiency that adversely affects an entitys ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report external financial data reliably in accordance with GAAP. A "significant deficiency" may be a single deficiency or a combination of deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected. For purposes of this Agreement, a "material weakness" in controls means a significant deficiency, or a combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. 

  

 (f) There are no outstanding loans made by the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the Exchange Act) or director of the Seller, other than loans that are subject to Regulation O under the Federal Reserve Act. 

  

 (g) Except (i) for those liabilities that are reflected or fully reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of the Seller as of September 30, 2005, and (ii) for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since September 30, 2005, neither the Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise due or to become due), that are required to be disclosed on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, that, either alone or when combined with all similar liabilities, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Seller Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (h) The Seller has not been notified by its independent registered public accounting firm or by the staff of the SEC that such accounting firm or the staff of the SEC, as the case may be, are of the view that any financial statement included in any Seller SEC Report should be restated which has not been restated in a subsequent Seller SEC Report that was filed prior to the date of this Agreement, or that the Seller should modify its accounting in future periods in a manner that would have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (i) Since January 1, 2005, neither the Seller nor the Seller Subsidiaries nor, to Sellers Knowledge, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of the Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries, has received any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, 

   ##### 

  

 

whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods of the Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries
or their respective internal accounting controls, including any complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that the Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices. To Sellers
Knowledge, no attorney representing the Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries,
whether or not employed by the Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries, has
reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach
of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Seller or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Sellers Board of Directors or any
committee thereof or to any director or officer of the Seller. Since January
1, 2005, there have been no internal investigations regarding accounting or
revenue recognition discussed with, reviewed by or initiated at the direction
of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, the Sellers Board

which there is a reasonable probability of an adverse determination and
which, if adversely determined, would, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Seller Material Adverse Effect. To Sellers Knowledge, neither Seller nor
any of the Seller Subsidiaries or their affiliates are liable for the payment
of any termination, break-up or other fee to Silver Acquisition Corp.
("Silver"), SAC Acquisition Corp. ("SAC"), or any of their affiliates,
advisers or representatives as a result of the Sellers termination of that

 (d) Neither the Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has received any order, decree, notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority asserting or claiming that the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary is, and to Sellers Knowledge, no facts or circumstances exist which would cause it or any of the Seller Subsidiaries to be deemed to be, (i) operating in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT ACT of 2001 and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Patriot Act"), any order issued with respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-money laundering statute, rule or regulation, except where any such violation would not have a Seller Material Adverse Effect; or (ii) not in satisfactory compliance, with the applicable privacy and customer information requirements contained in any federal and state privacy laws and regulations, including, without limitation, in Title V of the GLB Act, as well as the provisions of the information security program adopted pursuant to 12 C.F.R Part 40, except where the failure to so comply would not have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

No Title IV Plan is a "multiemployer pension plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

Except as required by COBRA, none of the Plans provides for or promises retiree medical, disability or life insurance benefits to any current or former employee, officer or director of the Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries. Each of the Plans is subject only to the laws of the United States or a political subdivision thereof. 

  

 (c) _Compliance with Applicable Law_. Each Plan has been operated in all respects in accordance with the requirements of all applicable Law and all persons who participate in the operation of such Plans and all Plan "fiduciaries" (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) have acted in accordance with the provisions of all applicable Law, except where such operations or violations of applicable Law would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. The Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries have performed all obligations required to be performed by any of them under, are not in any respect in default under or in violation of, and the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries have no Knowledge of any default or violation by any party to, any Plan, except where such failures, defaults or violations would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. No legal 

   ##### 

  

 

action, suit or claim is pending or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened with
respect to any Plan (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course)
and, except as disclosed in Section 2.10(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
to Sellers Knowledge, no fact or event exists that could give rise to any
such action, suit or claim. Except as disclosed in Section 2.10(c) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, neither the Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has

the Code that has not been satisfied in full and no condition exists that

No trust maintained or contributed to by the Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries is intended to be qualified as a voluntary employees beneficiary association or is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. 

  

 (e) _Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plans_. No Plan that is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan subject to Section 409A of the Code ("Section 409A") has been modified (as defined under Section 409A) on or after October 3, 2004 and all such non-qualified deferred compensation plans have been operated and administered in good faith compliance with Section 409A from the period beginning January 1, 2005 through the date hereof, except modifications and operations that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (f) _Absence of Certain Liabilities and Events_. There has been no non-exempt prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Plan. The Seller and each of the Seller Subsidiaries has not incurred any liability for any excise tax arising under Sections 4971 through 4980G of the Code that would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Seller Material Adverse Effect, and, to Sellers Knowledge, no fact or event exists that could give rise to any such liability. 

  

 (g) _Plan Contributions_. All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with respect to any Plan have been made on or before their due dates.

Neither the Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary is a party to any contracts for employment, severance, consulting or other similar contracts with any employees, consultants, officers or directors of the Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries. Neither the Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary is a party to any collective bargaining agreements. 

  

 (i) _Effect of Agreement_. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in conjunction with another event, entitle any current or former employee of the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment, including payments constituting "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, except as expressly provided herein,

If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event relating to Seller or any of its affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by Seller which should be set forth in an amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Seller shall promptly inform the Company. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus will comply in all material respects as to form with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act (to the extent applicable) and the rules and regulations thereunder.

any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any
Company Approvals, except in each case where the revocations or
modifications, the failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing

or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (b) The Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign business entity to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 (d) As used in this Agreement, the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any Effect that, individually or in the aggregate with other Effects, (i) is material and adverse to the business, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of the Company and Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (ii) materially impairs the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall not be deemed to include: (a) any Effect to the extent resulting from the announcement of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any Effect resulting from compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (c) any decrease in the price or trading volume of the Company Common Stock (but not excluding any Effect underlying such decrease to the extent such Effect would constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect), (d) any Effect to the extent resulting from changes in Laws generally applicable to the banking industry, (e) any Effect to the extent resulting from changes in generally accepted accounting principles which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is required to adopt, or (f) changes attributable to or resulting from changes in general economic conditions affecting the banking industry generally (unless such Effect would reasonably be expected to have a materially disproportionate impact on the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole relative to other banking industry participants).

No other "business combination," "control share acquisition," "fair price" or other anti-takeover laws or regulations enacted under Wisconsin state law applies to the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby by the Company, including the Merger.

 3.7 _Securities and Banking Reports; Financial Statements_. 

  

 (a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary have filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed with (x) the SEC since December 31, 2002, and as of the date of this Agreement have delivered or made available to the Seller, in the form filed with the SEC, (i) its Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively, (ii) all proxy statements relating to the Companys meetings of shareholders (whether annual or special) held since December 31, 2002, (iii) all Reports on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC since December 31, 2002, (iv) all other reports or registration statements filed by the Company with the SEC since December 31, 2002, and (iv) all amendments and supplements to all such reports and registration statements filed by the Company with the SEC since December 31, 2002 (collectively, the "Company SEC Reports") and (y) the FDIC, the OCC, the Federal Reserve Board, the OTS, the DFI and any other applicable Federal or state securities or banking authorities (all such reports and statements are collectively referred to with the Company SEC Reports as the "Company Reports"). The Company Reports (i) were prepared in accordance with the requirements of applicable Law and (ii) did not at the time they were filed, after giving effect to any amendment thereto filed prior to the date hereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact 

   ##### 

  

 

required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except that information as of a later date (but before the date
of this Agreement) will be deemed to modify information as of an earlier
date. The parties agree that failure of the Companys Chief Executive Officer
or Chief Financial Officer to provide any certification required to be filed
with any document filed with the SEC shall constitute an event that has a
Company Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (b) Each of the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements (including, if applicable, any related notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or required by reason of a concurrent change to GAAP) and each fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows and changes in financial position for the periods indicated, except (i) for any statement therein or omission therefrom which were corrected, amended or supplemented or otherwise disclosed or updated in a subsequent Company SEC Report, and (ii) that any unaudited interim financial statements do not contain the footnotes required by GAAP, and were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments, which were not or are not expected to be material in amount, either individually or in the aggregate. The Company has not had any dispute with any of its auditors regarding accounting matters or policies during any of its past three full fiscal years or during the current fiscal year-to-date requiring disclosure pursuant to Item 304 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. To the Companys Knowledge, the Companys auditors will deliver to the Company an unqualified audit opinion with respect to the Companys financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005, and unqualified opinions with respect to the effectiveness of the Companys internal controls and with respect to the assessment of management of the Company regarding the effectiveness of the Companys internal controls. 

  

 (c) To the Companys Knowledge, the Company and each of its officers and directors are in compliance with and have complied in all material respects with (A) the applicable provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder and (B) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE. With respect to each Report on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and each amendment of any such report filed by the Company with the SEC since December 31, 2002, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company have made all certifications required by Sarbanes-Oxley and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder at the time of such filing, and to the Companys Knowledge, the statements contained in each such certification were true and correct when made. Further, the Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably designed to ensure that material information (both financial and non-financial) relating to the Company and the subsidiaries required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications 

   ##### 

  

 

of the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of the
Company required by Section 302 of Sarbanes-Oxley with respect to
such reports. 

   

 (d) The Company has established and maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) ("internal controls"). To the Companys Knowledge, based on its evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, such internal controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of the Companys financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, to the Companys auditors and audit committee (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses known to the Company in the design or operation of internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in a material respect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any material fraud known to the Company that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in internal controls. The Company has made available to the Seller a summary of any such disclosure regarding material weaknesses and fraud made by management to the Companys auditors and audit committee since December 31, 2003. 

  

 (e) There are no outstanding loans made by the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the Exchange Act) or director of the Company, other than loans that are subject to Regulation O under the Federal Reserve Act. 

  

 (f) Except (i) for those liabilities that are fully reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company included in the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2005, and (ii) for the liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since September 30, 2005, neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), required to be disclosed on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP that, either alone or when combined with all similar liabilities, has had a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (g) The Company has not been notified by its independent public accounting firm or by the staff of the SEC that such accounting firm or the staff of the SEC, as the case may be, are of the view that any financial statement included in any registration statement filed by the Company under the Securities Act or any periodic or current report filed by the Company under the Exchange Act should be restated, or that the Company should modify its accounting in future periods in a manner that would have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (h) Since January 1, 2005, neither the Company nor the Company Subsidiaries nor, to the Companys Knowledge, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, has received any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or the Company Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing 

   ##### 

  

 

practices. To the Companys Knowledge, no attorney representing the Company
or the Company or Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of
securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company
or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Companys Board
of Directors or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of the
Company. Since January 1, 2005, there have been no material internal
investigations regarding accounting or revenue recognition discussed
with, reviewed by or initiated at the direction of the Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, general counsel, the Companys Board of
Directors or any committee thereof. 

   

 3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. 

  

 (a) Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, since December 31, 2004 to the date of this Agreement, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses only in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past practice and, since December 31, 2004, there has not been (i) any change in the financial condition, results of operations or business of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that has had a Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) any damage, destruction or loss (whether or not covered by insurance) with respect to any assets of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that has had, or would be reasonably expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (iii) any change by the Company in its accounting methods, principles or practices, (iv) any revaluation by the Company of any of its assets in any material respect, (v) any strike, work stoppage, slow down or other labor disturbance, (vi) the execution of any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or understanding with a labor union or organization, or (vii) any union organizing activities. 

  

 3.9 _Absence of Litigation_. 

  

 (a) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the best of the Companys Knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory investigations of any nature against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or challenging the validity or propriety of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as to which there is a reasonable probability of an adverse determination and which, if adversely determined, would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree or regulatory restriction imposed upon the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or the assets of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries which has had a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (c) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any order, decree, notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority asserting or claiming that the Company or any Company Subsidiary is, and to Companys Knowledge, no facts or circumstances exist which would cause it or any of the Company Subsidiaries to be deemed to be, (i) operating in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act, the Patriot Act, any order issued with respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-money laundering statute, rule or regulation, except 

   ##### 

  

 

where any such violation would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect; or
(ii) not in satisfactory compliance, with the applicable privacy and customer
information requirements contained in any federal and state privacy laws
and regulations, including, without limitation, in Title V of the GLB Act, as
well as the provisions of the information security program adopted pursuant
to 12 C.F.R Part 40, except where the failure to so comply would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company (or where appropriate
the Company Subsidiary) has adopted and implemented an anti-money laundering
program that contains adequate and appropriate customer identification
verification procedures that comply with Section 326 of the Patriot Act and
such anti-money laundering program meets the requirements in all material
respects of Section 352 of the Patriot Act and the regulations thereunder, and
it (or such other of the Company Subsidiaries) has complied in all material
respects, except where the failure to comply would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, with any requirements to file reports and other
necessary documents as required by the Patriot Act and the regulations
thereunder.

The information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the registration statement of the Company (the "Registration Statement") pursuant to which the shares of Company Common Stock to be issued in the Merger will be registered with the SEC shall not, at the time the Registration Statement (including any amendments or supplements thereto) is declared effective by the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall not, at the date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to stockholders, at the time of the Seller Stockholders Meeting and at the Effective Time, be false or misleading with respect to any material fact required to be stated therein, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event relating to the Company or any of its affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the Company which should be set forth in an amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Company will promptly inform the Seller. The Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall comply in all material respects as to form with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act (to the extent applicable) and the rules and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to any information about, or supplied or omitted by, the Seller which is contained in any of the foregoing documents.

The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to all of their respective properties and assets, real and personal, free and clear of all mortgage liens, and free and clear of all other liens, charges and encumbrances except liens for taxes not yet due and payable, pledges to secure deposits and such minor imperfections of title, if any, as do not materially detract from the value of or interfere with the present use of the property affected thereby or which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect; and all leases pursuant to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries lease from others material amounts of real or personal property are in good standing, valid and effective in accordance with their respective terms, and there is not, under any of such leases, any existing material default or event of default (or event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a material default and in respect of which the Company or such Company Subsidiary has not taken adequate steps to prevent such a default from occurring). Substantially all of the Companys and each of the Company Subsidiaries buildings and equipment in regular use have been reasonably maintained and are in good and serviceable condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted. 

  

 3.13 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company.

 (a) operate its business only in the usual, regular and ordinary course consistent with past practices; 

  

 (b) use all reasonable efforts to preserve intact its business organization and assets, maintain its rights and franchises, retain the services of its officers and key employees and maintain its relationships with customers; 

  

 (c) use all reasonable efforts to maintain and keep its properties in as good repair and condition as at present, ordinary wear and tear excepted; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) use all commercially reasonable efforts to keep in full force and effect director and officer liability insurance comparable in amount and scope of coverage to that now maintained by it (the "Existing DandO Policy"), except as provided in Section 6.5;

 (g) not to take any action or fail to take any action which, individually or in the aggregate, can be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 4.2 _Negative Covenants_. Except (i) as permitted by this Agreement, (ii) as disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedule, (iii) as required by Law, or by a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, _provided_ that prior to taking any such action, the Seller notifies the Company thereof and to the extent required by the Company, uses its reasonable best efforts to avoid having to take such action required by such Law or Governmental Authority, or (iv) as otherwise consented to in writing by the Company, during the period from the date hereof to the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Seller shall not do, or permit any Seller Subsidiary to do, any of the following: 

  

 (a) (i) except to maintain qualification pursuant to the Code, adopt, amend, renew or terminate any Plan or any agreement, arrangement, plan or policy between the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary and one or more of its current or former directors, officers or employees or (ii) except for normal increases in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and subject to the limitations set forth in Annex B, or increase in any manner the base salary, bonus, incentive compensation or fringe benefits of any director, officer or employee or pay any benefit not required by any plan or agreement as in effect as of the date hereof (including, without limitation, the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance units or shares); 

  

 (b) (i) except as provided below, declare or pay any dividend on, or make any other distribution in respect of, its outstanding shares of capital stock or limited liability company interests, except for (A) regular quarterly cash dividends on Seller Common Stock with usual record and payment dates for such dividends with each such dividend payable at a rate not in excess of $0.05 per share of Seller Common Stock and (B) dividends by a Seller Subsidiary either to the Seller or another Seller Subsidiary; 

   

 (i) declare or pay any dividends or make any distributions in any amount on Seller Common Stock in or with respect to the quarter in which the Effective Time shall occur and in which the stockholders of Seller Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends on the shares of Company Common Stock into which the shares of Seller Common Stock have been converted; _provided_ , _however_ , that it is the intent of this clause (ii) to provide that the holders of Seller Common Stock will receive either the 

   ##### 

  

   

payment of cash dividends on their shares of Seller Common Stock or the
payment of cash dividends as the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
received in exchange for the shares of Seller Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement for the calendar quarter during which the Effective Time shall
occur, but will not receive and will not become entitled to receive for the
same calendar quarter both the payment of a cash dividend as stockholders
of Seller Common Stock and the payment of a cash dividend as the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock received in exchange for the shares of Seller
Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement; and if the Seller does not declare
and pay cash dividends in a particular calendar quarter because of the
Sellers reasonable expectation that the Effective Time was to have occurred
in such calendar quarter wherein the holders of Seller Common Stock
would have become entitled to receive cash dividends for such calendar
quarter on the shares of Company Common Stock to have been exchanged for the

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 4.4, in the event that the Sellers Board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that in light of a Superior Offer it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Seller or the Sellers stockholders under applicable law, the Sellers Board of Directors may terminate this Agreement in the manner contemplated by Section 8.1(h) solely in order to concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Offer, but only after the fifth day following the Companys receipt of written notice advising the Company that the Sellers Board of Directors is prepared to accept a Superior Offer, and only if, during such five-day period, if the Company so elects, the Seller and its advisors shall have negotiated in good faith with the Company to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Seller to proceed with the transactions contemplated herein on such adjusted terms.

 (iv) _provided_ , _however_ , that in each of case (i), (ii) or (iii) immediately above, the Superior Offer shall be on terms that the Sellers Board of Directors determines, in its reasonable judgment to be more favorable to Seller stockholders (taking into account all factors which the Sellers Board of Directors may reasonably deem relevant, including, without limitation, the relative value and form of the consideration offered, all other terms and conditions of the respective offers, including, without limitation, the presence of a financial contingency, the likelihood of obtaining financing on a timely basis if a financing contingency is present, and the likelihood of obtaining any required regulatory approvals) than the terms of the Merger (after receipt and consideration of advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation).

 (c) In the event the Company or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5.

 6.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Seller shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to the Seller, of (i) the occurrence, or non occurrence, of any event the occurrence or non occurrence of which would be likely to cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate, and (ii) any failure of the Seller or the Company, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. 

  

 6.7 _Public Announcements_.

 6.8 _Exemption From Liability Under Section 16(b)_. The Seller and the Company agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain Insiders in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Insiders be relieved of the risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in connection with the conversion of shares of Seller Common Stock, Options, Seller stock-based awards into shares of Company Common Stock and Company rollover options and other awards denominated in shares of Company Common Stock in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 6.8. Following the delivery to the Company of the Section 16 Information in a timely fashion, the Company Board, or a committee of "Non-Employee Directors" thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), will adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by Insiders of Company Common Stock in exchange for or satisfaction of shares of Company Common Stock or Company stock-based awards, and of Company rollover options upon conversion of Options, in each case, pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act. "Section 16 Information" will mean information accurate in all material respects regarding Insiders, the number of shares of Seller Common Stock held by each such Insider and expected to be exchanged for Company Common Stock in the Merger, and the number and description of Options and Seller stock-based awards held by each such Insider and expected to be converted into Company rollover options and exchanged for Company Common Stock or awards denominated therein in connection with the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that the requirement for a description of any Options and Seller stock-based awards will be deemed to be satisfied if copies of all Seller stock plans and other Seller benefit plans, and forms of agreements evidencing grants thereunder, under which such Options and Seller stock-based awards, respectively, have been granted to Insiders, have been made available to the Company. "Insiders" will mean those officers and directors of Seller who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are listed in the Section 16 Information. 

  

 6.9 _Customer Retention_. To the extent permitted by law or applicable regulation, the Seller shall use all reasonable efforts to assist the Company in its efforts to retain the Sellers customers for the Surviving Corporation. Such efforts shall include making introductions of the Companys employees to such customers, assisting in the mailing of information prepared by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the Seller to such customers and actively participating in any "transitional marketing programs" as the Company shall reasonably request. 

  

 6.10 _Directorships_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Company shall take such action as may be reasonably required to cause the Companys Board of Directors to be expanded by one member and to appoint the person serving as the Chief Executive Officer of the Seller as of the date of this Agreement to the class of the Companys directors with terms expiring at the Companys 2008 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

 9.5 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

  

 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to in this Agreement) constitutes the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder.

   ##### 

  

 

for the specific performance of any provision herein or any other remedy
granted by law, equity or otherwise, in each case without posting a bond. Any
action for specific performance hereunder shall not be deemed exclusive and
may also include claims for monetary damages as may be warranted under the
circumstances. The prevailing party in any such suit, action or
other proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be
entitled to recover its costs, including attorneys fees, incurred in such
suit, action or other proceeding.

Unless the context otherwise requires (i) "or" is disjunctive but not necessarily exclusive, (ii) words in the singular include the plural and vice versa, (iii) the use in this Agreement of a pronoun in reference to a party hereto includes the masculine, feminine or neuter, as the context may require, and (iv) terms used herein that are defined in GAAP have the meanings ascribed to them therein. No provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in favor of, or against, any of the parties to this Agreement by reason of the extent to which any such party or its counsel participated in the drafting thereof or by reason of the extent to which any such provision is inconsistent with any prior draft hereof, and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any party hereto. The Seller Disclosure Schedule and the Company Disclosure Schedule, as well as all other schedules and all exhibits hereto, will be deemed part of this Agreement and included in any reference to this Agreement. This Agreement will not be interpreted or construed to require any Person to take any action, or fail to take any action, if to do so would violate any applicable Law. References to the "other party" or "either party" will be deemed to refer to Seller or the Company, as the case may be.

ANNEX B 

   

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS 

  

1\. _Conduct of Business Between Date of Signing the Agreement and the
Effective Time_ _._  Between the date of signing of the Agreement and the
Effective Time (i) there will be no increases in base salary for employees of
Seller or Seller Subsidiaries with employment agreements except in the dollar
amounts specified in such agreements, or, if none are specified, increases in
base salary on an employees annual review date consistent with past
practice; (ii) there will be no increases in base salary for other employees
of Seller or Seller Subsidiaries except for increases in base salary on an
employees annual review date consistent with past practice; (iii)
unless otherwise agreed between Seller and the Company, no bonuses or
incentive payments will be paid to employees of Seller or Seller
Subsidiaries, except for those pursuant to (A) established commission and
other objective, performance-based plans and (B) established, subjective
performance-based plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that the aggregate amount
of bonuses paid pursuant to all established, subjective performance-based
plans shall not, unless otherwise agreed between Seller and the Company,
exceed an amount that is one million dollars ($1,000,000) greater than
the aggregate amount of bonuses paid or accrued under the Seller or Seller
Subsidiarys subjective performance plans in the prior calendar year; (iv) no
new programs, plans or agreements providing compensation or benefits for
employees or directors of Seller or Seller Subsidiaries will be adopted or
implemented, existing programs, plans or agreements will not be amended or
modified except as required by applicable law, or as provided herein or in
agreements executed by employees in connection herewith, and no further
grants or awards will be made under existing plans, programs or agreements of
Seller or Seller Subsidiaries, except as may be agreed to by the Company;
(v) there will be no officer title promotions without the Companys consent,
except that if an officer position becomes vacant, another officer may be
promoted to that position if he or she assumes the former employees job
responsibilities; (vi) no new consulting agreements or
employment continuation agreements will be granted to employees of Seller or
Seller Subsidiaries and the existing agreements will not be amended, except
as provided herein or in agreements executed simultaneously herewith; (vii)
in no event will Seller make employer contributions to its retirement
programs except to the extent consistent with past practice, and Seller will
not make any amendments or modifications to its retirement programs, without
first obtaining the consent of the Company, other than amendments required to
maintain the tax-qualified status of any such retirement programs; and (viii)
Seller or Seller Subsidiaries will only pay severance to those employees who
are terminated by their employer and then only in amounts and for a period
consistent with past practice of the employer. 

   

 2\. _General_. 

    

(a) _Transferred Employees_. Those individuals who are employed by the Seller
or any of the Seller Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time shall be
hereinafter referred to as the "Transferred Employees." 

   

(b) _Credit for Past Service_. After the Effective Time, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall give the Transferred Employees full credit for
their prior service with 

   ##### 

  

   

the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries (or any service credited as such in
connection with a previous acquisition by the Seller or any Seller
Subsidiary): (i) for purposes of eligibility (including without limitation
initial participation and eligibility for current benefits) and vesting under
any qualified or nonqualified retirement or profit sharing plans maintained
by the Company in which Transferred Employees may be eligible to participate;
and (ii) for all purposes under any welfare benefit plans, "cafeteria plans"
(as defined in Code Section 125), vacation plans and similar arrangements
maintained by the Company. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, the Company will not give credit for prior service to Transferred
Employees as regards the Companys retiree health plan. 

   

(c) _Waiver of Certain Limitations_. The Company will, or will cause the
Companys affiliates or the Seller Subsidiaries to, waive all limitations as
to preexisting conditions and waiting periods with respect to participation
and coverage requirements applicable to the Transferred Employees under any
welfare benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to participate in
after the Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting periods that are
already in effect with respect to such employees and that have not
been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any welfare plan maintained for
the Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Transferred Employees still have to meet
the service requirements (recognizing past service credit given in Section
2(b), above) and other eligibility criteria under the Companys plans, except
that Transferred Employees, regardless of service, will be entitled to
receive a matching contribution on amounts contributed to the Companys
401(k) plan, if they otherwise meet all the other criteria for the match
under the plan terms. 

   

(d) _Company s Ability to Amend, Modify or Terminate Plans_. Nothing
contained in this Annex shall limit the right of the Company or its
affiliates, at any time and from time to time, to amend, modify or terminate,
in whole or in part, any of the plans referenced in this Annex, except that
no such amendment shall nullify the provisions of this Annex B, and the
Company hereby reserves such right. 

 

3\. _Employee Welfare Plans_. The Sellers existing health and dental plans
and other employee welfare benefit plans shall remain in effect at least
until the Effective Time. Thereafter, Transferred Employees will be
integrated into the Companys health and dental plans and other employee
welfare plans at a time determined on a plan-by-plan basis by the Company in
its sole discretion. If integration occurs during a plan year, Transferred
Employees shall receive credit for co-pays, deductibles and similar limits.
Until the Transferred Employees are integrated into the Company plans, the
respective Seller plans shall remain in effect. 

  

4\. _401(k) Plan_. The Sellers 401(k) plan shall be merged into the Companys
401(k) plan as soon as practicable after the Effective Time. No employee or
employer contributions shall be paid to the Sellers 401(k) plan from or on
account of compensation paid after the Effective Time. 

    ##### 

  

    

5\. _ESOP_. The Sellers employee stock ownership plan (the "ESOP") shall
terminate as of the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time the Sellers
Board of Directors shall approve such termination and any amendments
necessary to incorporate the terms of this paragraph, such approvals to be
conditioned upon closing of the Merger. The assets remaining in the ESOPs
suspense account, after repayment by the ESOP of its remaining debts, shall
be allocated among the accounts of Transferred Employees who are ESOP
participants at the Effective Time in proportion to their compensation for
the period from January 1, 2006 to the Effective Time, provided, however, that
the amount of compensation to be considered for any participant shall not
exceed the annual amount of $220,000 prorated for such compensation
measurement period. The specific method of allocation (including the
treatment of any allocations in excess of Code limitations) may be adjusted
if required in order to secure a favorable determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service regarding the tax-qualified status of the ESOP upon
its termination and/or a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service to the effect that repayment of the ESOP debts with proceeds
of the exchange of the unallocated shares for cash will not violate the
requirements for exemption under Code Section 4975(d)(3) and that the
allocation of assets remaining in the ESOPs suspense account after such
repayment will not constitute annual additions for purposes of Code Section
415\. Distributions to ESOP participants shall be made as soon as practicable
after the later to occur of the Effective Time and the receipt of such
determination letter and/or private letter ruling. 

    ##### 

  

     

ANNEX C 

   

FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL TO SELLER 

   

 1. The Seller is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Kansas, and has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted as described in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each Seller Subsidiary is a state banking association, corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, charitable foundation or trust duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of its incorporation or formation. Each Seller Subsidiary has the requisite power and authority as a corporation or other legal entity to carry on its business as it is now being conducted as described in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. 

  

 2. The Seller and each Seller Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation or other foreign legal entity, as the case may be, to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for qualification or licensing in any such jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 3. The Seller has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver the Merger Agreement and to perform its obligations thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby (other than, with respect to the Merger, the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Sellers stockholders in accordance with the KGCL and the Seller Articles and the Seller Bylaws). 

  

 4. The execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by the Seller and the consummation by the Seller of the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Seller (other than, with respect to the Merger, the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Sellers stockholders in accordance with the KGCL and the Seller Articles and the Seller Bylaws). 

  

 5. The Merger Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Seller and, assuming the due execution and delivery thereof by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Seller, enforceable against the Seller in accordance with its terms, (a) except as such enforceability may be subject to the effect of any laws affecting insured depository institutions, applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, receivership, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and to the effect of general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (b) except as the enforceability of the indemnity provisions may be limited by federal or state securities laws or the public policy underlying such laws or may otherwise be limited by applicable provisions of the KGCC. 

  

 6. The authorized capital stock of the Seller consists, immediately prior to the Effective 

   ##### 

  

 

Time, of 50,000 shares of Seller Common Stock and 50,000 shares of the Seller
Preferred Stock. 

   

 7. The execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by the Seller do not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by the Seller will not, conflict with or violate (a) the Seller Articles or Seller By-Laws, each as amended to the date hereof or (b) any statute, rule or regulation of the United States of America or the State of Kansas applicable to the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary or by which any of their respective properties is bound or affected or (c) to our knowledge, any order, judgment or decree applicable to the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary or by which any of their respective properties is bound or affected, the conflict with which or the violation of which would, in our judgment, be reasonably expected to result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 8. To our knowledge, except as otherwise set forth in the Seller Disclosure Schedule, there is no litigation or governmental proceeding pending against the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator or overtly threatened against the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary in writing which (a) questions, directly or indirectly, the validity or enforceability of the Merger Agreement or (b) is, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely, in our judgment, to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 9. Except as otherwise set forth in the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Seller and/or one or more of the Seller Subsidiaries owns of record, and to our knowledge, owns beneficially, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of each of the Seller Subsidiaries. 

  

 10. The proxy statement portion of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (excluding the financial statements and other financial and statistical information included or incorporated therein or omitted therefrom, and all information about, or supplied or omitted by, the Company for use in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, as to all of which we do not express any opinion), at the time it was first mailed to holders of Seller Common Stock and at the date of the Seller Stockholders Meeting, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act. 

  

* * * * * * 

   

 We have participated in the preparation of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement and, in the course of such preparation, in conferences with certain officers and employees of the Seller with respect thereto. Although we are not passing upon or assuming any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained or incorporated in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, during the course of such participation, no facts have come to our attention which would lead us to believe that the Proxy Statement/Prospectus at the time it was first mailed to holders of Seller Common Stock and at the time of the Seller Stockholders Meeting, or the Registration Statement at the time it became effective and at the Effective Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (except that we do not comment with respect to the financial statements and other financial and statistical information included therein 

   ##### 

  

 

or omitted therefrom, or any information about, or supplied or omitted by, the
Company for use in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration
Statement). 

    #####

 We have participated in the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement and, in the course of such preparation, in conferences with certain officers and employees of the Company with respect thereto. Although we are not passing upon or assuming any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained or incorporated in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, during the course of such participation, no facts have come to our attention which would lead us to believe that the Proxy Statement/Prospectus at the time it was first mailed to holders of Seller Common Stock and at the time of the Seller Stockholders Meeting, or the Registration Statement at the time it became effective and at the Effective Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (except that we do not comment with respect to the financial statements and other financial and statistical information included therein or omitted therefrom, or any information about, or supplied or omitted by, the Seller for use in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement).
