representing such share of Company Shares in the manner provided in Section

effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal or dissenters rights
(collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or
represent the right to consideration for Company Shares set forth in Section
2.6(a) and the holder or holders of such shares shall be entitled only to such
rights as may be granted to such holder or holders in Section 262 of the DGCL.

  

  

(ii) At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 2.6(c)(i), if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall
effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such
holder\'s appraisal rights and dissenters rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL, or a Court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is
not entitled to relief provided under Section 262 of the DGCL, then, as of the
later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder\'s
Company Shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the
right to receive the consideration for Company Shares set forth in Section
2.6(a), without interest, following surrender of the certificate representing
such shares in the manner provided in Section 2.8 or, in the case of a lost,
stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of the

15  

  

 

 

 

   
 

demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of

delayed, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise
or offer to settle or compromise, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

outstanding and shall cease to represent the right to acquire shares of Common
Stock or Preferred Stock and in consideration for such cancellation,
automatically shall be converted into (i) with respect to each Company Share
underlying a Warrant, the right to receive, without interest, and

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16

Shares), the Options and the Warrants. No interest shall be paid or shall
accrue on any cash payable to Company Holders pursuant to the provisions of
this ARTICLE II. Any cash deposited with the Payments Administrator shall
hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund."

  

  

(c) Escrow Fund Deposit. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit into the Escrow
Fund (as contemplated by Section 2.12) with the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer

following the Escrow Termination Date, the Escrow Agent shall make available
to the Payments Administrator for distribution to the Company Holders, and the
Payments Administrator shall pay, in accordance with this ARTICLE II and
subject to the provisions of Section 9.4, the then-remaining amount in the
Escrow Fund, if any, minus any portion of the Escrow Fund subject to pending
Claims, to the Company Holders (the "Escrow Release Amount ").

  

  

(d) Representative Reimbursement Amount Deposit. At the Closing, Parent shall
make a cash payment to the Representative, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Representative prior to the
Closing Date, in an amount equal to the Representative Reimbursement Amount
(as contemplated by Section 8.2). Promptly following the termination of the
Representative\'s obligations pursuant to Section 8.2 hereof, the
Representative shall make available to the Payments Administrator for
distribution to the Company Holders and the Payments Administrator shall pay,
in accordance with this ARTICLE II, the then-remaining amount of the
Representative Reimbursement Amount, if any, to the Company Holders (the
"Representative Release Amount").

  

  

(e) Exchange Procedures. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Payments Administrator to mail to each holder of record (as of the
Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates or an instrument or
instruments (the "Certificates"), which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented (i) outstanding Company Shares whose shares were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as set forth herein, and
(ii) Warrants which were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as set forth herein, the following: (A) a letter of transmittal
(which shall be in a form customary for transactions of this nature and
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) and (B) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for such Merger
Consideration. As soon as practicable following surrender of Certificates for
cancellation to the Payments Administrator, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and such other documents as may reasonably be required by
the Payments Administrator, the holder of record of such Certificates (unless
such Certificates represent Dissenting Shares) shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash, without interest, constituting the
portion of Merger Consideration at such times and in such amount as such
holder is entitled under this ARTICLE II and the Certificates so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. At the election of the respective Company
Holder, the Payments Administrator shall make the foregoing payment by wire
transfer if the aggregate amount owed to any such Company Holder at the
Closing is in excess of $50,000. Until so surrendered, outstanding
Certificates (other than those representing Dissenting Shares, unless the
holder thereof effectively withdraws or loses its right to appraisal) will be
deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to
evidence, in the case of Company Holders, the right to receive such holder\'s
portion of Merger Consideration under this Agreement, without interest, into
which such securities shall have been so converted.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(f) Required Withholding. Each of Parent, the Payments Administrator, the
Escrow Agent and the Surviving Corporation (including its payroll agent), as
the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any Merger
Consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder or former holder of Company Shares, Options, and Warrants such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code
or under any other applicable federal, state, local or foreign Laws (to the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, the amount of such
consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been
paid). Any amounts withheld pursuant to this Section 2.8(f) shall timely be
paid to the appropriate Tax Authority.

  

  

(g) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
2.8, neither the Payments Administrator, Parent, Acquisition Sub, the
Surviving Corporation nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of
Company Shares for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  

(h) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates six (6) months after the
Effective Time shall, at the request of the Surviving Corporation, be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation or otherwise according to the
instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of the Certificates
who have not surrendered such Certificates in compliance with this Section 2.8
shall after such delivery to the Surviving Corporation look only to Parent and
the Surviving Corporation for the amount of cash constituting the Closing
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6(a) with respect to the Company
Shares formerly represented thereby. If any Certificate shall not have been
surrendered immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority, any such portion
of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of the Company\'s
securities immediately prior to such time shall, to the extent permitted by
Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

2.9. No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. All cash or other
consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Company Shares, Options
and Warrants in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares,
Options and Warrants, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Surviving Corporation of Company Shares which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE II.

  

  

2.10. Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed, upon (i) the
making of an affidavit of fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed and (ii) the execution and
delivery to the Surviving Corporation by such Person of an indemnity agreement
(A) against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

   
 

the Payments Administrator with respect to such Certificates and (B) in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Payments Administrator,
the Payments Administrator shall, subject to Section 2.8(e), pay in exchange
for such lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed Certificate the amount
of Merger Consideration (without interest) such Person would have been
entitled to receive had such Person surrendered such lost, stolen, mutilated,
defaced or destroyed Certificate to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
Section 2.8(e).

  

  

2.11. Further Action. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Acquisition
Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do,
in the name and on behalf of the Company and Acquisition Sub, any other
actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under
any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

  

  

2.12. Escrow. In connection with the Closing, Parent, the Representative and
the Escrow Agent shall have executed and delivered an escrow agreement in a
form customary for transactions of this nature, containing terms and
conditions consistent with those set forth herein and reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Company (the "Escrow Agreement") under which a Person mutually
satisfactory to Parent and the Representative shall act as escrow agent (the
"Escrow Agent") with respect to an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") for the
purposes of securing the payment of applicable indemnification obligations
pursuant to ARTICLE IX. The Merger Consideration otherwise payable to the
Company Holders pursuant to Sections 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 but for this Section
2.12 shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Escrow Amount. The parties
will, to the extent consistent with applicable Law, treat the Escrow Fund and
any earnings thereon as owned by Parent for tax purposes. Upon the termination
of the Escrow Fund in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and Section 9.4 of
this Agreement, each Company Holder shall receive its Pro Rata Portion of
Escrow Amount less such Company Holder\'s Pro Rata Portion of any
indemnification obligations pursuant to ARTICLE IX. The adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, by the stockholders of the Company shall constitute approval of
the Escrow Agreement and all arrangements related thereto, including the
depositing of the Escrow Amount into the Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding anything
else in this Section 2.12 to the contrary, any amounts withheld under this
Section 2.12 payable to holders of Options shall satisfy the separate account
requirements of Section 404(a)(5) of the Code, if applicable. Any interest
accruing with respect to the Escrow Fund shall be deemed part of the Escrow
Amount for all indemnification and escrow disbursement purposes hereunder. The
right of any Company Holder to receive its Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow
Fund, if any, (i) is an integral part of the Merger Consideration provided for
in this Agreement, (ii) does not give the Company Holders dividend rights,
voting rights, liquidation rights, preemptive rights or other rights of
holders of capital stock of the Company, (iii) shall not be evidenced by a
certificate or other instrument, (iv) shall not be assignable or otherwise
transferable by such Company Holder, except by will, upon death or by
operation of Law, and (v) does not represent any right other than the right to
receive the consideration set forth in this Section 2.12. Any attempted
transfer of the right to any portion of the Escrow Amount by any holder
thereof (other than as specifically permitted by the immediately preceding
sentence) shall be null and void.

otherwise subject to any restriction or limitation, any of the assets,

proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection
with substantive meetings, discussion or proceedings under or relating to any
Antitrust Law, and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority,
the Company shall provide Parent the opportunity to attend and participate in
any such substantive meetings, discussions or proceedings. The foregoing
obligations shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and attorney-
client, work product or other privilege.

  

  

5.3. Approvals, Filings and Consents; Further Assurances.

  

  

(a) Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall, as promptly as
practicable, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all other necessary
Approvals from Governmental Authorities not otherwise addressed in Section 5.2

41  

  

 

 

 

   
 

communication with, and any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement
with, any Governmental Authority regarding any such Approval. Neither the
Company, on the one hand, nor Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, shall independently participate in any meeting, or engage in any
substantive conversation, with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
such Approval, investigation or other inquiry without giving Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, prior notice of the meeting and discussing with
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, the advisability of Parent\'s or
the Company\'s representatives, as the case may be, participating in such
meeting or conversation.

  

  

(b) [Reserved]

  

  

(c) The Company Board has declared this Agreement and the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement advisable and adopted a resolution
recommending adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the
Voting Holders. The Company shall set the close of business on the day prior

this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby. Promptly
after execution of this Agreement, the Company shall distribute to its
principal stockholders an action by written consent to approve and adopt this
Agreement and the Merger in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws of the Company and pursuant to Sections 228 and 251(c) of the DGCL,
and shall use best efforts to deliver to Parent duly executed written consents
of stockholders constituting the Stockholder Approval by 11:59 pm Eastern Time
on the Business Day following the execution of this Agreement. Promptly
following the date of the Stockholder Approval, the Company shall send to the
Voting Holders a notice of the Stockholder Approval pursuant to Section 228(e)
of the DGCL and, pursuant to Section 262(d) of the DGCL, a notice and
disclosure statement (the "Disclosure Statement"), which shall comply with
applicable Law and shall include (i) a summary of the Merger and this
Agreement (which summary shall include a summary of the terms relating to
indemnification provisions of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, and a
statement that the execution of the letter of transmittal shall constitute
approval of such terms), (ii) the Historical Financial Statements and 2014
Financials, (iii) a statement that appraisal rights are available for the
Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL together with a copy of
such section, and (iv) a letter of transmittal, including instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of Company Certificates pursuant to a validly
executed and duly completed letter of transmittal. The Company agrees not to
distribute the Disclosure Statement until Parent has had a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Disclosure Statement and the Company
and Parent reasonably agree on which such comments should be reflected in the
Disclosure Statement. Promptly following the date hereof, the Company shall
send written notice to each holder of an Option or Warrant of the execution of
this Agreement, the anticipated closing date of the Merger and any other
information required by the terms of such Option or Warrant, except to the
extent any such requirements have been waived in writing by such holder.

  

  

5.4. Access to Information. Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall afford
to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of
Parent (the "Parent

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Representatives"), reasonable access during normal working hours to all of its
properties, books, Contracts and records and the Company shall furnish
promptly to Parent all information concerning its and its Subsidiaries
business, properties, books, Contracts, records and Company Personnel as
Parent may reasonably request. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to make available to Parent Representatives, upon the reasonable
request of Parent and during normal working hours, all officers, accountants,
counsel and other representatives or agents of the Company for discussion of
the Company\'s businesses, properties or current Company Personnel as Parent
may reasonably request. All information obtained by Parent pursuant to this
Section 5.4 shall constitute "Confidential Information" pursuant to the terms
of the Confidential Disclosure Agreement, dated July 11, 2013 between Parent
and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). No investigation pursuant
to this Section 5.4 or notice pursuant to Section 5.5 or any information
received by a party to this Agreement will affect any representations or
warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement.

  

  

5.5. Notice of Certain Events. Each party hereto shall promptly notify the
other parties hereto of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event,
condition, fact, circumstance, occurrence, transaction or other item of which
such party becomes aware after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date
that would constitute a material violation or breach of this Agreement (or a
material breach of any representation or warranty contained herein), if the
existence of such item on the Closing Date would constitute the non-
satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI hereof.

  

  

5.6. Public Announcements. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company
shall consult with and obtain the approval of (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld) the other party before issuing any press release or
other public announcement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement, and no
party hereto shall issue or cause to be issued any such press release prior to
such consultation and approval, except to the extent required by applicable
Law, in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or make
such public announcement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consult
in good faith with the other party before issuing any such press release or
making any such public announcement to attempt to agree upon mutually
satisfactory text. Upon the Closing, Parent and the Company shall issue a
mutually agreed upon press release announcing the transactions contemplated
hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.6 shall be
deemed to prohibit any party from making any disclosure that its counsel deems
necessary in order to fulfill such party\'s disclosure obligations imposed by
any Regulation of any national securities exchange or automated quotation
system, so long as the disclosing party consults with the other party prior to
such disclosure.

  

  

5.7. Directors\' and Officers\' Liability Insurance; Assumption of
Indemnification Agreements.

  

  

(a) Pursuant to the provisions of the Company Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers
and directors of the Company in respect of acts or omissions occurring while
such persons are officers and directors to at least the same extent as is
provided under the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as in
effect on the date of this

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Agreement. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will amend, repeal or
modify such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of such persons; provided, however, that such indemnification shall
be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable Law.

  

  

(b) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall have taken such action necessary to
provide directors\' and officers\' liability insurance coverage on terms and
amounts no less favorable than those of such Company liability insurance
policy in effect on the date of this Agreement (a true and complete copy of
which has been made available to Parent) for any current or former officers
and directors of the Company under Parent\'s directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance policy with respect to any actions or omissions by such
directors or officers occurring prior to the Effective Time, and shall
maintain such coverage for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date;
provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to pay a premium for such
insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date
of this Agreement (the "Maximum Amount"), which premium the Company represents
and warrants is set forth in Section 5.7(b) of the Disclosure Schedule;
provided further that if the amount of annual premiums necessary to maintain
or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent shall
procure and maintain for such six-year period the most advantageous policy
available for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount.

  

  

(c) Parent shall pay, perform, fulfill and discharge, from and after the
Effective Time, the obligations of every nature of the Company under any
indemnification agreements then in effect with each of the present and former
officers and directors of the Company (or his or her heirs or representatives)
in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof.

  

  

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.7 shall survive consummation of the
Merger and are (a) expressly intended to benefit each of the present and
former officers and directors of the Company (or his or her heirs or
representatives) who are entitled to indemnification by the Company as of the
date of this Agreement and (b) in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may
have by Contract or otherwise.

  

  

5.8. Insurance. The Company shall use commercially reasonably efforts to keep
all insurance policies currently in effect, or comparable replacements
therefor, in full force and effect through the Effective Time.

  

  

5.9. Acquisition Proposals.

  

  

(a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall
not authorize or knowingly permit any of its and its Subsidiaries' employees,
stockholders, agents and Representatives to directly or indirectly: (i)
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries
with respect to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any offer or
proposal for an Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) or any inquiry,
proposal or offer which it reasonably believes could lead

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

   
 

to an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate
in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
nonpublic information with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry, proposal or offer which it reasonably believes could lead to an
Acquisition Proposal; (iii) engage in discussions with any Person with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer which it
reasonably believes could lead to an Acquisition Proposal, except to inform
such Person of the existence of these provisions; (iv) approve, endorse,
recommend, agree to or consummate any Acquisition Proposal; (v) enter into any
letter of intent or similar document or any contract, agreement or commitment
contemplating any Acquisition Proposal or transaction contemplated thereby or
(vi) resolve, propose or agree, or authorize or permit any Representative, to
do any of the foregoing. The Company and its Subsidiaries will as soon as
possible cease any and all existing activities related to its proposed initial
public offering, including the filing of any additional forms, reports or
other documents with the SEC, responding to SEC comments and participating in
road show presentations, engaging in discussions with underwriters and pricing
the initial public offering, unless required by applicable Law or pursuant to
the written consent of Parent. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries shall
waive, amend or grant a release under any confidentiality or standstill
agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer
from any Person relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of
a any instrument or assets that constitute 10% or more of the net revenues or
net income of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case taken as a whole,
10% or more of the future revenue expected to be generated by CVT-301 or the
ARCUS technology, or 10% or more of the aggregate equity interests of the
Company, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result
in any person beneficially owning 10% or more of the aggregate equity
interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the acquisition of 10% or more of
the aggregate equity interests or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any other transaction the consummation of which would be
reasonably likely to impede, interfere with or prevent the Merger, other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(b) As promptly as practicable after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (but
in no event later than 24 hours after receipt thereof) or any request for
nonpublic information or inquiry, offer or proposal which it reasonably
believes could lead to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall, to the
extent not precluded by any obligation of confidentiality, provide Parent with
oral and written notice of the receipt of such Acquisition Proposal, request,
offer or inquiry, which notice shall include (i) a copy of any written
Acquisition Proposal and any other documents provided to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries with respect to such Acquisition Proposal or (ii) in respect
of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry relating to an Acquisition Proposal
or any request for information relating to an Acquisition Proposal not made in
writing, a written summary of the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry or request including the identity of the Person or group of Persons
making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that both (i) the Company has
not breached Section 5.3(c) or this Section 5.9 and (ii) the Stockholder
Approval has not been obtained, the Company may, directly or indirectly,
furnish information and access in response to unsolicited requests therefor to
any Person or group, pursuant to an appropriate confidentiality agreement, and
may participate in discussions and negotiate with such Person or group
concerning any Acquisition Proposal if the Company Board determines in its
good faith judgment, after consultation with legal counsel and its financial
advisors, that failure to do so is inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
the Company Holders under applicable Law; provided, however, that (A) in no
event shall any such Acquisition Proposal or any discussion or negotiation
with respect thereto give the Company the right to terminate this Agreement
and (B) except for such confidentiality agreement, the Company shall not enter
into any Contract with respect to such Acquisition Proposal.

  

  

5.10. Payoff Letters. Not later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent payoff letters from each
Person to whom the Company owes Venture Debt setting forth the amount payable
to such lender for the complete satisfaction of related Liabilities and for
the release of all related Liens, all in a form reasonably consistent with
existing commercial lending industry practice and reasonably satisfactory to
Parent.

  

  

5.11. No Section 338 Election or Similar Actions. Neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall make any election under section 338 of the Code
(or any similar provision under state, local, or foreign Law) with respect to
the acquisition of the Company; file any amended Tax Return for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period; or, unless required by Law, take any other action after
the Closing that would have the effect of increasing the Company Holders\'
indemnification obligations hereunder.

  

  

5.12. Alkermes Payment. At the Closing, Parent shall pay and satisfy the
Alkermes Option Payment, it being acknowledged by each of the parties hereto
that the Merger shall constitute an Acquisition Event (as such term is defined
in the Alkermes Agreement); provided, however, that if, at or prior to the
Closing, the Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent a written consent
of Alkermes, Inc. to the effect that the payment by Parent of such Alkermes
Option Payment at the Closing shall satisfy and discharge all amounts payable
to Alkermes, Inc. under the Alkermes Agreement in connection with the exercise
of the option to purchase the current commercial-scale manufacturing facility
equipment in accordance with Section 3.13 of the Alkermes Agreement, Parent
shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Alkermes, Inc. the Alkermes Option Payment
in accordance with Section 3.13 of the Alkermes Agreement.

  

  

5.13. Employee Benefits. To the extent such persons remain employed with the
Surviving Corporation after the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide each employee of the Company who is employed by the
Company at the Effective Time (the "Continuing Employees") with (i) base
salary or base rate of pay and an annual target cash bonus (or equivalent)
opportunity that is, in each case, at least as favorable as those provided to
such Continuing Employee by the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (ii) a level of other employee benefits (but excluding equity-based
compensation or benefits, retiree or post-employment welfare benefits or
severance benefits) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company immediately prior to the

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Effective Time, in each case for a period of twelve (12) months following the
Closing Date. For purposes of determining eligibility and vesting and for
purposes of determining benefits and accruals (but not for purposes of benefit
accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) under the employee benefit
plans, programs, agreements or arrangements sponsored by Parent or its Plan
Affiliates (the "Parent Plans") providing benefits after the Effective Time,
each Continuing Employee shall receive full credit for his or her service with
the Company as of the Effective Time, except to the extent that such credit
would result in duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
(i) to cause each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting period, in any and all Parent Plans (to the
extent that such waiting period did not apply to such Continuing Employee and
his or her eligible dependents under the comparable Company Plan) and (ii) to
the extent permitted by the then existing terms thereof, to cause any "group
health plans" (within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) to (A)
waive any pre-existing condition exclusions or waiting periods for each
Continuing Employee (to the extent that such exclusions or waiting periods did
not apply to such Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents under
a comparable Company Plan) and (B) for the plan year in which participation in
any Parent Plan first occurs, if immediately prior thereto such Continuing
Employee (or his or her eligible dependents) was participating in a comparable
plan of the Company or its Plan Affiliates, credit such Continuing Employee
(and his or her eligible dependents) for any deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses paid, if any, during the Company or Plan Affiliate plan year in
effect at the time participation in the Parent Plan commences but only for the
remainder of the applicable Parent Plan year (to the extent that such credit
was given under the comparable plan of the Company or its Plan Affiliates
immediately prior to initial participation in the Parent Plan) in satisfying
any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any Parent Plan
in which such Continuing Employee may be eligible to participate after the
Effective Time for the same plan year. Nothing contained herein is intended to
amend any Company Plan or Parent Plan or to confer upon any Continuing
Employee or any other Person any benefits under any benefit plans, programs,
policies or other arrangements or right to employment or continued employment
with Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation. For the avoidance of
doubt, no provision in this Section 5.13, whether express or implied, shall
(i) create any third party beneficiary or other rights with respect to this
Section 5.13 in any employee or former employee of the Company (including any

and (ii) any such amendment, modification, waiver or consent that affects any
Company Holder in a manner that is adverse in relation to other Company
Holders must be executed by such adversely affected Company Holder to be
binding on such Company Holder.

  

  

8.2. Representative Reimbursement Amount. The Representative Reimbursement
Amount shall be held by the Representative in a segregated account for
reimbursements payable to the Representative under this Section 8.2, or, as
provided below, the payment of fees, commissions or other compensation to the
Representative. In the event that Representative utilizes the entire
Representative Reimbursement Amount, the Representative shall be entitled to
draw any additional amounts necessary for reimbursements payable to the
Representative from the Escrow Fund, subject to and in accordance with the
provisions of the Escrow Agreement. The portion of the Representative
Reimbursement Amount contributed following the Effective Time pursuant to this
Section with respect to each holder of Company Shares, Options and Warrants
shall be in accordance with such holder\'s Pro Rata Portion. Any portion of
the Representative Reimbursement Amount originally deposited with the

to ARTICLE IX or, if later, the date on which all indemnification claims of
Indemnified Parties outstanding at the end of such period have been discharged
in full, shall be delivered by the Representative to the Payments
Administrator for further distribution to the Company Holders.

  

  

8.3. Exculpation.

  

  

(a) In dealing with this Agreement and any instruments, agreements or
documents relating thereto, and in exercising or failing to exercise all or
any of the powers conferred upon the Representative hereunder or thereunder
(i) the Representative shall not assume any, and shall incur no,
responsibility or liability whatsoever to any Company Holder by reason of any
error in judgment or other act or omission performed

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

   
 

or omitted hereunder or in connection with this Agreement or any other
transaction document, unless by the Representative\'s gross negligence or
willful and intentional misconduct, and (ii) the Representative shall be
entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other
independent experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in
judgment or other act or omission of the Representative pursuant to such
advice shall in no event subject the Representative to liability to any
Company Holder unless by the Representative\'s gross negligence or willful and
intentional misconduct. Except as set forth in the previous sentence,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Representative shall have no liability whatsoever to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any other Person. The Company Holders will indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Representative from and against any and all losses,
liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees,
costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and
their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, "Representative Losses") arising out of or in connection with
the Representative\'s execution and performance of this Agreement or any other
transaction document, in each case as such Representative Loss is suffered or
incurred; provided, that in the event that any such Representative Loss is
finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Representative, the Representative will reimburse
the Company Holders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the
extent attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not
paid directly to the Representative by the Company Holders, any such
Representative Losses may be recovered by the Representative from (i) the
funds in the Representative Reimbursement Amount, and (ii) the amounts in the
Escrow Fund at such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable
to the Company Holders; provided, that while this section allows the
Representative to be paid from the Representative Reimbursement Amount and the
Escrow Fund, this does not relieve the Company Holders from their obligation
to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred,
nor does it prevent the Representative from seeking any remedies available to
it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Representative be required to
advance its own funds on behalf of the Company Holders or otherwise. The
Company Holders acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnities will
survive the resignation or removal of the Representative or the termination of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Company Holder shall have
any liability with respect to Representative Losses in excess of the Merger
Consideration received by such Company Holder.

  

  

(b) All of the immunities and powers granted to the Representative under this
Agreement shall survive until the earlier of (i) the termination of this
Agreement or (ii) the distribution of the Representative Reimbursement Amount
to Company Holders pursuant to Section 8.2. The provisions of this ARTICLE
VIII shall be binding upon the executors, heirs, legal representatives,
successors and assigns of each Company Holder, and any references in this
Agreement to a Company Holder or the Company Holders shall mean and include
the successors to the Company Holders\' rights hereunder, whether pursuant to
testamentary disposition, the laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(c) The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, by the Stockholder Approval shall
also be deemed to constitute approval of all arrangements relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby and to the provisions hereof binding upon the
Voting Holders, including this Section 8.3.

  

  

(d) In no event shall any of the provisions set forth in this ARTICLE VIII be
binding upon or result in any liability to Parent, Acquisition Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective directors, managers,
officers, employees, agents, stockholders or Affiliates (except to the extent
that any such directors, managers, officers, employees, agents, stockholders
or Affiliates is a Company Holder and then only in their capacity as a Company
Holder).

  

  

ARTICLE IX

  

INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

9.1. General Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this ARTICLE IX, from and after
the Closing Date, Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation and
each of their respective present and former officers, directors, employees,
agents, stockholders, members, partners, managers, representatives, assigns,
successors and Affiliates (each, an "Indemnified Party" and collectively the
"Indemnified Parties") shall be indemnified solely (except for Securityholder
Claims as set forth in Section 9.2(g)) out of the Escrow Fund against all
Liabilities, losses, claims, damages, Actions (including informal
proceedings), investigations, audits, demands, assessments, adjustments,
Judgments, settlement payments, deficiencies, Taxes, penalties, fines and
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and disbursements of
every kind, nature and description and costs of enforcing rights to indemnity
hereunder) (collectively, "Damages"), arising out of, relating to or caused by
any of the following:

  

  

(i) any breach of the representations or warranties made by the Company in
this Agreement;

  

  

(ii) any failure by the Company to satisfy or perform any covenant, agreement
or term of this Agreement, required to be satisfied or performed by the
Company prior to the Effective Time; and

  

  

(iii) any failure of any Company Holder to have good and valid title to the
Company Shares, Options and Warrants issued in the name of such Company
Holder, free and clear of all Liens.

  

  

9.2. Limitation and Survival of Indemnification Obligations.

  

  

(a) De Minimis Claims Excluded and Threshold. There shall be no liability for
indemnification under Section 9.1(a)(i) and Section 9.1(a)(ii), unless (i)
with respect to any given claim for Damages, the amount of such individual
claim (aggregating all claims and Damages from substantially the same or
similar facts)

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

   
 

exceeds $100,000 (each a "De Minimis Claim") and (ii) the aggregate amount of
Damages for non-De Minimis Claims under said Sections 9.1(a)(i) and 9.1(a)(ii)
exceeds one-half percent (0.5%) of the Base Amount (the "Deductible"), at
which time, subject to the remainder of this Section 9.2, the Indemnified
Parties will be entitled to indemnification for only the amount of such
Damages (for clarity, excluding any De Minimis Claims) that exceed the
Deductible; provided, however, that the restrictions for De Minimis Claims and
the Deductible shall not apply to any Securityholder Claims or any breach of
any representation or warranty contained in Section 3.1, Section 3.2(a),
Section 3.2(b), Section 3.2(c), Section 3.2(d), Section 3.3, Section 3.6,
Section 3.18, Section 3.20, Section 3.22, or Section 3.23 (the "Specified
Representations").

  

  

(b) Determination of Damages. Solely for purposes of calculating the amount of
any Damages arising out of, relating to, or caused by any breach by the
Company of any representation or warranty made by the Company in this
Agreement for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this ARTICLE IX or would be entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this ARTICLE IX but for any limitation imposed on the payment thereof by
the Deductible, any references in any such representation or warranty to
"material," "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualifications
shall be disregarded.

  

  

(c) Liability Caps. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, except in the case of fraud, any Claims for indemnification under
Section 9.1 shall be satisfied solely out of and limited solely to (i) with
respect to Claims, other than Securityholder Claims, the Escrow Fund and (ii)
with respect to Securityholder Claims against a Company Holder individually,
first such Company Holder\'s Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund, and after
the exhaustion of such Company Holder\'s Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund,
the Merger Consideration received by such Company Holder (the "Securityholder
Cap").

  

  

(d) Sole and Exclusive Remedy. In the event the Merger is consummated, the
sole and exclusive remedies of Indemnified Parties for any Claims pursuant to
ARTICLE IX or for any other Damages arising out of or in connection with the
Merger or otherwise under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement shall,
except in the case of fraud, be (i) to assert Claims, other than
Securityholder Claims, against the Escrow Fund held in escrow pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement and (ii) to assert Securityholder Claims against an
individual Company Holder, first against such Company Holder\'s Pro Rata
Portion of the Escrow Fund, and after the exhaustion of such Company Holder\'s
Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund, the Merger Consideration received by such
Company Holder; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 9.2(d) shall
be deemed to limit or restrict the rights of the Indemnified Party to seek
specific performance or other injunctive relief.

  

  

(e) Limitations on Individual Liability. No Company Holder shall have any
liability (i) with respect to Claims other than Securityholder Claims, in
excess of its Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund and (ii) with respect to
Securityholder Claims against such Company Holder individually, in excess of
its Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund and after the exhaustion of its Pro
Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund, the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Merger Consideration received by such Company Holder, in each case, except in
the case of fraud. In the event that the Merger is not consummated, no Company
Holder shall have any liability under or with respect to this Agreement. Any
Damages satisfied from the Escrow Fund in respect of a Claim made pursuant to
Section 9.1, other than Securityholder Claims, shall reduce each Company
Holder\'s then-existing Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund on a pro rata
basis. Any Damages satisfied from the Escrow Fund in respect of a
Securityholder Claim shall be satisfied first from the Escrow Fund and shall
reduce the Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund of the Company Holder who is
the subject of the Securityholder Claim. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, in no event shall any Indemnified Party, its successors or
permitted assigns be entitled to claim or seek rescission of the transactions
consummated by this Agreement, except in the case of fraud.

  

  

(f) Several and Not Joint Liability; Additional Remedies. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company Holders shall have
several, and not joint nor joint and several, liability under this ARTICLE IX;
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 9.2(f) shall be deemed to
limit or restrict the rights of the Indemnified Party to pursue the remedies
of specific performance or other injunctive relief against any breaching
Company Holder in connection with any Securityholder Claim, up to the
Securityholder Cap. In no event shall a Company Holder be liable under this
ARTICLE IX for any Securityholder Claims arising out of any act, omission,
breach or failure of any other Company Holder.

  

  

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, "Securityholder Claims" means any Claims
for indemnification against such Company Holder under Section 9.1(a)(iii).

  

  

(h) Notwithstanding Section 5.7, each Company Holder hereby agrees that it
will not make any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Company by reason of the fact that
such Company Holder was a controlling person, officer, director, employee,
agent, stockholder, representative or Affiliate of the Company or was serving
as such for another Person at the request of the Company (whether such claim
is for Damages of any kind or otherwise and whether such claim is pursuant to
any statute, organizational document, contractual obligation or otherwise)
with respect to any Claim brought by an Indemnified Party against the Escrow
Fund or any such Company Holder under this ARTICLE IX. Notwithstanding Section
5.7, with respect to any Claim brought by an Indemnified Party against the
Escrow Fund or any Company Holder under this ARTICLE IX, each Company Holder
expressly waives any right of subrogation, contribution, advancement,
indemnification or other claim against the Company, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to any amounts owed by such Company Holder pursuant
to this ARTICLE IX.

  

  

(i) With respect to any indemnification obligations under Section 9.1,
Indemnified Parties shall have no right to indemnification unless an
Indemnified Party delivers to the Representative an Indemnification Notice or
a notice of Claims under Section 9.5(a) or (b), in each case on or before the
date that is the twelve (12)-month anniversary of the Closing Date (the
"Escrow Termination Date").

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(j) The representations, warranties and covenants of the Company, and the
Indemnified Party's right to indemnification with respect thereto, shall not
be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the Indemnified Party (including by any of its Representatives) or
by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party or any of its Representatives
knew or should have known that any such representation or warranty is, was or
might be inaccurate or by reason of the Indemnified Party's waiver of any
condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b).

  

  

9.3. Survival and Expiration of Representations and Warranties.

  

  

(a) The representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing and shall expire on the Escrow Termination Date, subject
to the provisions of Section 9.3(b). It is the express intent of the parties
that, if an applicable survival period as contemplated by this Section 9.3 is
shorter than the statute of limitations that would otherwise apply, then, by
contract, the applicable statute of limitations shall be reduced to the
survival period contemplated hereby. The parties further acknowledge that the
time periods set forth in this Section 9.3 for the assertion of claims under
this Agreement are the result of arms-length negotiation among the parties and
that they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed by the parties.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any Claim alleging any
misrepresentation, breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty or
any breach of covenant made in compliance with the provisions of Section
9.2(i) prior to the Escrow Termination Date shall survive the expiration of
such representation or warranty or covenant until final resolution of such
Claim and payment of any Damages associated therewith.

  

  

9.4. Release of Escrow Fund. In accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Escrow Agreement, on the Escrow Termination Date, any amounts remaining in
the Escrow Fund minus any portion of the Escrow Fund subject to pending Claims
shall be released from the Escrow Fund for disbursement to the Company Holders
in accordance with their respective then-existing Pro Rata Portions thereof.
Any remaining portion of the Escrow Fund, after payment and satisfaction of
any and all pending Claims, shall be released from the Escrow Fund for
disbursement to the Company Holders promptly following resolution of such
pending Claims.

  

  

9.5. Indemnification Procedures. All claims for indemnification under this
ARTICLE IX ("Claims") shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

  

  

(a) Third Party Claims.

  

  

(i) Promptly after receipt by any Indemnified Party of notice of the
commencement of any action by a third party in respect of which the
Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification under ARTICLE IX (a
"Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall notify the Representative in
writing (an "Indemnification Notice"), who shall in turn notify each person
that is obligated to provide such indemnification (an "Indemnifying Party")
thereof in writing, but any failure to so notify the Representative or the
Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, shall not relieve the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have to the Indemnified
Party other than, in the case of a failure to notify the Representative, to
the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby or such
Indemnification Notice is not delivered by the Indemnified Party to the
Representative within twelve (12) months following the Closing Date as
required by Section 9.2(i). Such notification shall include a description in
reasonable detail (to the extent known by the Indemnified Party) of the facts
constituting the basis for such Third Party Claim and the amount of the
Damages claimed.

  

  

(ii) The Representative shall, for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Party,
have the right to assume control of the defense of the Indemnified Party
against the Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Party or, if the Representative does not assume such defense, to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim.

  

  

(iii) So long as the Representative is conducting the defense of the Third
Party Claim (A) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel at its own cost and
expense (which cost and expense shall not constitute Damages) to assist in the
handling of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that such Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate
counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if (x) so requested by the
Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Party, to participate or (y) in
the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict or
potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party that would make such separate representation advisable and (B) the
Representative shall not consent to the entry of any Judgment or enter into
any settlement that subjects the Indemnified Party to any injunctive relief or
other equitable remedy or does not include as an unconditional term thereof
the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnified Party of a
release from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, unless with
the consent of each Indemnified Party.

  

  

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if with respect to a Third Party Claim,
(A) such Third Party Claim seeks equitable relief that would materially
adversely affect the ongoing business of any of the Indemnified Parties
(including its relationships with current or potential customers, suppliers or
other parties material to the conduct of its business) if such Third Party
Claim is decided against any of the Indemnified Parties, (B) the
Representative, on behalf of the Indemnifying Party, does not provide the
Indemnified Party with evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party
that the Representative, on behalf of the Indemnifying Party, will have
adequate financial resources to defend against the Third Party Claim and
fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder, (C) such Third Party Claim
relates to or otherwise arises in connection with Intellectual Property or any
criminal or regulatory enforcement Action, (D) the Representative, on behalf
of the Indemnifying Party, does not actively and diligently conduct the
defense of the Third Party Claim, (E) the Indemnified Party has been advised
by counsel that (x) there are one or more legal or equitable defenses
available to it with a reasonable prospect of success which are not available
to the Representative or the Indemnifying Party or (y) there exists a
reasonable likelihood of a

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

   
 

conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party and the Representative or
the Indemnifying Party; (F) the Third Party Claim could reasonably be expected
to give rise to Damages which are more than two times (2x) the aggregate
amount remaining to be indemnified under the Escrow Amount after giving effect
to all other claims paid or pending claims pursuant to Section 9.1, (G) the
Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, indictment, allegation or investigation of the Indemnified Party,
then, in any such case, the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to assume
control of the defense of such Third Party Claim, including the right to
contest and defend such Third Party Claim in the first instance and to settle
such Third Party Claim with the consent of the Representative, on behalf of
the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. If the Indemnified Parties do not contest and defend
such Third Party Claim, the Representative, on behalf of the Indemnifying
Party, shall have the right to contest and defend such Third Party Claim and
to settle such Third Party Claim with the consent of the Indemnified Party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
subject to Section 9.5(a)(ii). If the Indemnified Parties shall have exercised
the right to contest, defend and settle any such Third Party Claim instead of
the Representative, by reason of the foregoing provisions of this Section
9.5(a)(iv), the Representative, on behalf of the Indemnifying Party, shall be
entitled, at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to participate in
the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel.

  

  

(v) If for any reason the Representative does not assume and conduct the
defense of the Third Party Claim on behalf of the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend such Third Party Claim at the
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party will
promptly reimburse the Indemnified Party therefor in accordance with this
Section 9.5(a), subject to the limitations set forth herein.

  

  

(vi) The reimbursement of fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified
Party as required by this Section 9.5(a) shall be made from the Escrow Fund by
periodic payments during the course of the investigations or defense, as and
when bills are received or expenses incurred.

  

  

(vii) The party controlling the defense of the Third Party Claim shall keep
the other party advised of the status of such Third Party Claim and the
defense thereof and shall consider recommendations made by the other party
with respect thereto.

  

  

(b) Other Claims. In the event any Indemnified Party should have a Claim under
this ARTICLE IX that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted
against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the Indemnified
Party shall deliver written notice of such Claim promptly and stating the
nature, basis and amount of the Claim in reasonable detail to the
Representative, who in turn shall notify the Indemnifying Party. The failure
by any Indemnified Party to so notify the Representative, or the
Representative to so notify the Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, shall
not relieve any liability under this ARTICLE IX, except, in the case of a
failure to notify the Representative, to the extent that the ability to defend
such Claim or demand shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure or such notice of

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Claim is not delivered by the Indemnified Party to the Representative within
twelve (12) months following the Closing Date as required by Section 9.2(i).
If the Representative, on behalf of the Indemnifying Party, disputes the
liability with respect to such Claim, the Representative, on behalf of the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through
negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate
Court of competent jurisdiction.

  

  

9.6. Tax Treatment. Any payments made under this ARTICLE IX or Section 9.4
shall be treated, to the extent consistent with applicable Law, as an
adjustment to the Closing Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes.

  

  

9.7. Limitations.

  

  

(a) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be responsible or liable for any
Damages or other amounts under this ARTICLE IX for special or punitive damages
unless such Damages are included in the Damages payable in a Third Party
Claim. Nothing herein shall limit the obligations of the Indemnified Parties
to mitigate damages to the extent require by applicable Law. Any request for
indemnification of specific costs will include invoices and supporting
documents containing reasonably detailed information about the costs and/or
damages for which indemnification is being sought.

  

  

(b) The amount of Damages recoverable by an Indemnified Party under this
ARTICLE IX with respect to a Claim shall be reduced by the amount of any
payment received by such Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate thereof), with
respect to the Damages to which such Claim relates, from an insurance carrier.
An Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to pursue, and to cause its
Affiliates to pursue, all insurance claims to which it may be entitled in
connection with any Damages it incurs, and the parties shall cooperate with
each other in pursuing insurance claims with respect to any Damages or any
indemnification obligations with respect to Damages; provided, that the
Indemnifying Party shall be under no obligation to any Indemnified Party to
purchase or maintain any insurance policy to comply with this Section 9.7(b).
If an Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate) receives any insurance payment in
connection with any Claim for which it has already received an indemnification
payment from the Indemnifying Party, it shall pay to the Indemnifying Party,
within thirty (30) days of receiving such insurance payment, an amount equal
to the excess, if any, of: (i) the amount of the insurance payments received
(but only to the extent of indemnification payments previously received in
connection with such claim) over (ii) the sum of any increased insurance
premiums payable by the Indemnified Party as a result of such insurance claim
plus the amount of Damages with respect to such Claim which the Indemnified
Party has become entitled to receive under this ARTICLE IX.

  

  

(c) The amount of Damages recoverable by an Indemnified Party under this
ARTICLE IX with respect to a Claim shall be reduced to take into account any
net Tax savings reasonably expected to be received by the Indemnified Party
resulting from such Damages and increased to take into account any net Tax
costs reasonably

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

   
 

expected to be incurred by the Indemnified Party resulting from any payment
for indemnification under this ARTICLE IX. In computing the amount of any such
Tax savings and costs, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all
other income gain, loss, deduction, or credit before recognizing any item
arising from the incurrence or payment of any Damages subject to
indemnification.

10.1. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with its schedules and
exhibits, the Confidentiality Agreement, and all other Ancillary Agreements,

entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede any and all prior discussions, negotiations, understandings,
proposals, undertakings or agreements, either oral or written. Each party to

agreement, statement, or promise with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement that is not contained herein or therein shall be valid or binding.

  

  

10.2. Amendment and Waiver.

  

  

(a) No failure or delay on the part of any party in exercising any right,
power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
remedy. The remedies provided for herein are, subject to Sections 9.2(d) and
9.7, cumulative and are not exclusive of any remedies that may be available to
any party at Law, in equity or otherwise.

  

  

(b) Except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement, this
Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time, whether before or after
the Stockholder Approval has been obtained; provided, however, that, after the
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no amendment that
by Law requires further approval by stockholders of either party, without the
further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

  

  

(c) Except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement, any
amendment, supplement or modification of or to any provision of this Agreement
and any waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective (i) only
if it is made or given in writing and signed by Parent and the Company (or, if
after the Closing, the Representative) or, in the case of a waiver, by the
party granting the waiver (or such party\'s attorney-in-fact) and (ii) only in
the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which made or given.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

   
 

10.3. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, including with respect to the present and former director and
officers of the Company who may benefit from the provisions of Section 5.7 of
this Agreement and for the Indemnified Parties, this Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns and nothing
herein expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give to any Person,
other than the parties and such successors and assigns, any legal or equitable
rights hereunder. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall have the right to
pursue damages on behalf of the Company Holders in the event of Parent or
Acquisition Sub\'s breach or wrongful termination of this Agreement, which
right is hereby acknowledged by Parent and Acquisition Sub.

  

  

10.4. Assignment. No party hereto shall assign or otherwise transfer this
Agreement or any of its rights hereunder, or delegate any of its obligations
hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto
(except the Representative, to a successor Representative, in the case of
appointment of a successor Representative pursuant to Section 8.1(d)). Subject
to the foregoing, this Agreement and the rights and obligations set forth
herein shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon the parties hereto,
and each of their respective successors, heirs and permitted assigns.

  

  

10.5. Waivers. No waiver by any party, whether express or implied, of its
rights under any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of the
party\'s rights under such provisions at any other time or a waiver of the
party\'s rights under any other provision of this Agreement. No failure by any
party to take any action against any breach of this Agreement or default by
another party shall constitute a waiver of the former party\'s right to
enforce any provision of this Agreement or to take action against such breach
or default or any subsequent breach or default by the other party. To be
effective any waiver must be in writing and signed by the waiving party (or
such party\'s attorney-in-fact).

  

  

10.6. Governing Law; Venue.

  

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by the Laws of the State of New York,
except for matters within the scope of the DGCL, which shall be governed
thereby, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of the State of New York, the State of Delaware or
any other jurisdictions) that would cause application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York or the DGCL as the case may be.

  

  

(b) Each party, by its execution hereof, and each Company Holder (i) hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York state
court sitting in New York, New York, United States of America for the purpose
of any Action between the parties arising in whole or in part under or in
connection with this Agreement, (ii) hereby waives to the extent not
prohibited by applicable Law, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a
defense or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject
personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is
exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that any such Action brought in
one of the above-named courts should be dismissed on grounds of forum non
conveniens, should be transferred or removed to any court other than one of
the above-named courts, or should

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

   
 

be stayed by reason of the pendency of some other proceeding in any other
court other than one of the above-named courts, or that this Agreement or the
subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such court and (iii) hereby
agrees not to commence any such Action other than before one of the above-
named courts. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, a party may commence any
Action in a court other than the above-named courts solely for the purpose of
enforcing an order or judgment issued by one of the above-named courts.

  

  

(c) Each party waives any claim and will not assert that venue should properly
lie in any other location within the selected jurisdiction.

  

  

(d) Each party hereby (i) consents to service of process in any Action between
the parties arising in whole or in part under or in connection with this
Agreement in any manner permitted by New York Laws, (ii) agrees that service
of process made in accordance with clause (i) of this Section 10.6(d) or made
by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at its address
specified pursuant to Section 10.11, will constitute good and valid service of
process in any such Action and (iii) waives and agrees not to assert (by way
of motion, as a defense, or otherwise) in any such Action any claim that
service of process made in accordance with clause (i) or (ii) of this Section
10.6(d) does not constitute good and valid service of process.

  

  

10.7. Specific Performance. The rights and remedies of the parties hereto
shall be cumulative. The transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
unique transactions and any failure on the part of any party to complete the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms of this Agreement
will not be fully compensable in damages and the breach or threatened breach
of the provisions of this Agreement would cause the other parties hereto
irreparable harm. Accordingly, in addition to and not in limitation of any
other remedies available to the parties hereto for a breach or threatened
breach of this Agreement, the parties shall be entitled to specific
performance of this Agreement and an injunction restraining any such party
from such breach or threatened breach, it being understood, for the avoidance
of doubt, that neither Parent nor the Company shall be entitled to receive
both the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, respectively, and
the remedy of specific performance to cause the completion of the merger.

  

  

10.8. Waiver of Jury Trial. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW
THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE, AND COVENANT THAT THEY WILL
NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER NOW EXISTING
OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE
PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY
COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR
AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF

TRANSACTIONS, AND SUCH PROCEEDING WILL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF
COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

  

  

10.9. Interpretation. The schedules and exhibits attached hereto are an
integral part of this Agreement. All schedules and exhibits attached to this
Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and all references herein to
this "Agreement" shall mean this Agreement together with all such schedules
and exhibits. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections,
subsections, schedules or exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section,
subsection, schedule or exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be
deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The word
"herein" and similar references mean, except where a specific Section or
Article reference is expressly indicated, the entire Agreement rather than any
specific Section or Article. The table of contents and the headings contained
in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. As used herein, all
pronouns shall include the masculine, feminine, neuter, singular and plural
thereof whenever the context and facts require such construction. Certain
sections of the Disclosure Schedule contain disclosures which include more
information than is required by the Sections of the Agreement to which such
sections relate and such additional disclosure shall not be deemed to mean
that such information is required by such related Sections of the Agreement
(for example, the fact that a Section of the Agreement calls for a listing of
material agreements does not necessarily mean that any such agreement listed
on the related Section of the Disclosure Schedule is material). Headings have
been inserted on the sections of the Disclosure Schedule for convenience of
reference only and shall to no extent have the effect of amending or changing
the express description of the sections of the Disclosure Schedule as set
forth in this Agreement. Any deductible or de minimis claim amounts set forth
in ARTICLE IX shall not be construed in any way to define the general use of
the term "material" or like phrases. Materials filed publicly by the Company
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shall be deemed "made
available" or "provided" to the Parent, as applicable, whether or not such
materials were also posted in a separate data room.

  

  

10.10. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect.

  

  

10.11. Notices. All notices or other communications which are required or
permitted hereunder shall be in writing and sufficient if delivered personally
or sent by nationally-recognized overnight courier providing evidence of
delivery or by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested, at the following addresses or sent by facsimile, with confirmation
received, to the facsimile number specified below:

10.12. Representation by Counsel. Each party hereto acknowledges that it has
been advised by legal and any other counsel retained by such party in its sole
discretion. Each party

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

   
 

acknowledges that such party has had a full opportunity to review this
Agreement and all related exhibits, schedules and ancillary agreements and to
negotiate any and all such documents in its sole discretion, without any undue
influence by any other party hereto or any third party.

  

  

10.13. Legal Representation and Post-Closing Privilege.

  

  

(a) Ropes and Gray LLP (the "Seller Counsel") has acted as legal counsel to the
Company, and each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation
agrees that after the Closing, Seller Counsel may act as legal counsel to the
Representative after the Closing in future matters, including in connection
with matters, obligations or disputes (including any litigation, arbitration,
mediation, claim or proceeding) arising under or related to (i) this
Agreement, (ii) the Escrow Agreement and any other agreements entered into
pursuant to or contemplated by this Agreement (such agreements, together with
this Agreement, being referred to herein as the "Relevant Agreements") and
(iii) the transactions contemplated by the Relevant Agreements (the
"Transactions").

  

  

(b) Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation hereby (i)
agrees that Seller Counsel may represent the Representative after the Closing,
(ii) consents to the disclosure by Seller Counsel to the Representative, at
any time, of any information learned by Seller Counsel in the course of its
representation of the Company, whether or not such information may otherwise
be subject to the attorney-client privilege or any duty of confidentiality,
and (iii) waives and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries and other Affiliates to
waive, any conflict of interest that may arise from or relate to Seller
Counsel representing the Representative after the Closing including in
connection with any negotiation, litigation, arbitration, mediation or other
proceeding arising under or related to the Relevant Agreements or the
Transactions. The Parent and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation) will not seek to have Seller Counsel disqualified from
representing the Representative whether or not such representation may relate
to the Company, the Relevant Agreements, the Transactions or any matter or
dispute that may arise under or in connection with the Relevant Agreements or
the Transactions and notwithstanding (x) whether the interests of the
Representative may be directly adverse to the interests of the Parent and the
Surviving Corporation after the Closing or (y) whether such representation may
be substantially related to Seller Counsel\'s representation of the Company
prior to the Closing.

  

  

(c) From and after the Closing, all pre-Closing communications between the
Company Holders, the Company or any of their respective officers, employees,
partners, members, directors or Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller
Counsel, on the other hand with respect to the Relevant Agreements and the
Transactions (the "Pre-Closing Confidential Communications"), shall be deemed
to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the Representative
(and not to the Surviving Corporation). All books, records and other materials
of the Company in any medium (including electronic copies) containing or
reflecting any of the Pre-Closing Confidential Communications or the work
product of legal counsel with respect thereto, including any related
summaries, drafts or analyses, and all rights with respect to any of the
foregoing, solely to the extent of the Pre-Closing Confidential Communication,
are hereby assigned

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

   
 

and transferred to the Representative effective as of the Closing. Such
material and information shall be excluded from the transfer contemplated by
this Agreement and shall be distributed to the Representative immediately
prior to Closing with no copies thereof retained by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates or representatives. From and
after the Closing Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of all such material and
information. From and after the Closing, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, or any of their respective Affiliates and representatives shall
access or in any way, directly or indirectly, use or rely upon any such
materials or information. To the extent that any such materials or information
are not delivered to the Representative they will be held for the benefit of
the Representative, and Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
Affiliates will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver all such
material and information to the Representative promptly upon discovery
thereof, without retaining copies thereof. From and after the Closing, neither
the Representative nor Seller Counsel shall have any duty to reveal or
disclose to Parent, Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective
Affiliates (and Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
Affiliates will not have any right to access or review) the Pre-Closing
Confidential Communications by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between Seller Counsel and the Company or otherwise. To the extent that files
of Seller Counsel in respect of its representation of the Company in
connection with the Relevant Agreements and the Transactions constitute
property of the client, all property rights thereto are hereby assigned and
transferred to the Representative effective as of the Closing.

  

  

(d) From and after the Closing, the Representative shall have the exclusive
power to control the disclosure of the Pre-Closing Confidential Communications
and, in its sole discretion, to assert or waive any attorney-client privilege
or expectation of client confidence with respect thereto. Each of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation waives and agrees not to assert against the
Representative any attorney-client privilege or confidentiality obligation
with respect to the Pre-Closing Confidential Communications. If and to the
extent that at any time after Closing Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Affiliates has the right to assert or waive an attorney-
client privilege with respect to any Pre-Closing Confidential Communications,
Parent and Surviving Corporation shall not waive (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates not to waive) such privilege without the prior written
consent of the Representative.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.13, in
connection with any post-Closing dispute between Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Affiliate thereof on the one hand and a third party other
than the Representative on the other hand which dispute does not relate to the
Relevant Agreements or the Transactions, the Representative will, upon the
request and at the cost of Parent, take reasonable steps to assert or permit
the Surviving Corporation to assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure by Seller Counsel to such third party of confidential attorney-
client privileged communications between the Company and Seller Counsel that
occurred prior to Closing; provided, however, that (x) the Surviving
Corporation may not disclose such information or seek any waiver of or purport
to waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the
Representative, not to be unreasonably withheld

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

 

   
 

conditioned or delayed, and (y) the Representative may waive such privilege or
disclose such information to the extent they determine in good faith that such
waiver or disclosure is appropriate to maintain their rights, or reduce their
potential liability, under the Relevant Agreements.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the ownership of, and the
right to assert or waive the attorney-client or any other applicable
privileges with respect to all other pre-closing confidential communications
between the Company and its Subsidiaries and its internal or external counsel
(and any attorney work product prepared by such counsel in connection
therewith), other than those constituting Pre-Closing Confidential
Communication, shall remain with the Surviving Corporation upon consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereunder.

  

  

(g) Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation hereby acknowledges and
confirms that it has had the opportunity to review and obtain adequate
information regarding the significance and risks of the waivers and other
terms and conditions of this Section 10.13, including the opportunity to
discuss with counsel other than Seller Counsel such matters and reasonable
alternatives to such terms. This Section 10.13 is for the benefit of the
Company Holders, the Representative and Seller Counsel. Seller Counsel is an
intended third party beneficiary of this Section 10.13, and no term of this
Section 10.13 may be amended, waived, revoked or modified, without the prior
written consent of Seller Counsel and the Representative.

  

  

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such attorney-client privilege,
attorney work product protection and client confidence shall also belong to
and also be controlled by the Surviving Corporation (and not heretofore waived
by the Surviving Corporation) and shall be deemed passed to and claimed by the
Surviving Corporation after the Closing to the extent any such attorney-client
privilege, attorney work product protection or client confidence is required
to be waived or otherwise required to be similarly released by any
Governmental Authority, under applicable Laws or pursuant to any Judgment,
and, in any such case, the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates shall not
be in breach or violation of any provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement for providing any information, documents, communications or client
confidences to any Governmental Authority in response to and subject to the
requirements of, and limitation in, the foregoing.

  

  

10.14. Construction. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiations
and drafting of this Agreement and in the event of any ambiguity or question
of intent or interpretation, no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

  

  

10.15. Headings. The section headings contained in this Agreement are inserted
for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

10.16. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of all parties,
but all of which counterparts when

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

72  

  

 

 

 

   
 

taken together will constitute one and the same agreement. Facsimile
signatures shall constitute original signatures for all purposes of this
Agreement.
