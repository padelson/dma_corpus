3.16(b)     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
(this "Agreement"), dated as of September 21, 2005, among DRS Technologies,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Maxco, Inc., a Missouri corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Engineered
Support Systems, Inc., a Missouri corporation (the "Company").  
RECITALS   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company each have determined that it is in the best interests of
their respective companies and stockholders to enter into and consummate
this Agreement, providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the
Company with the Company as the surviving corporation, and subject to the
conditions set forth herein; and   WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to
make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE 1  THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger. At the
Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the General and
Business Corporation Law of Missouri (the "MBCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall thereupon cease (the "Merger"). The Company shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the
"Surviving Corporation"). The Merger shall have the effects specified in the
MBCL.   1.2 The Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at
the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, located at Four
Times Square, New York, New York, at 10:00 a.m., local time, as soon as
practicable but in no event later than the Outside Date (as defined in
Section 7.1(b)(i)). The date on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter
referred to as the "Closing Date."   1.3 Effective Time. If all the
conditions to the Merger set forth in Article 6 shall have been fulfilled or
waived in accordance herewith and this Agreement shall not have been
terminated as provided in Article 7, the parties hereto shall cause Articles
of Merger meeting the requirements of the MBCL (the "Articles of Merger") to
be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Missouri on the Closing
Date. The Merger shall become effective at the time of filing of the Articles
of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Missouri in accordance
with the MBCL, or at such later time which the parties hereto shall have
agreed upon and designated in such filings as the effective time of the
Merger (the "Effective Time").   1.4 Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws,
Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. (a) The Amended Articles
of Incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, from and after the Effective Time, until duly amended in
accordance with applicable Law and the terms thereof.   (b) The Amended and
Restated By-Laws of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation from and
after the Effective Time, until duly amended in accordance with applicable
Law, the terms thereof, and the Surviving Corporation\'s Articles of
Incorporation.   (c) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation from and
after the Effective Time, until their successors are duly appointed or
elected in accordance with applicable Law and the Surviving Corporation\'s
Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws.   (d) The directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time, until their
successors are duly appointed or elected in accordance with applicable Law
and the Surviving Corporation\'s Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws.  
ARTICLE 2  EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON SECURITIES OF MERGER SUB AND THE
COMPANY   At the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the
securities of Merger Sub or the Company:   2.1 Merger Sub Stock. Each share
of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.  
2.2 Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Company (the "Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock owned by Parent or
Merger Sub or held by the Company, all of which shall be cancelled, and other
than the shares of Dissenting Common Stock (as defined in Section 2.6)) shall
be converted into the right to receive (i) the amount of $30.10 in
cash without interest (the "Cash Consideration") and (ii) a fraction of a
fully paid and nonassessable share (the "Parent Stock Consideration") of the
common stock, $.01 par value per share, of Parent ("Parent Stock") equal to
one share of Parent Stock multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. "Exchange Ratio"
means (a) if the Parent Common Stock Value is $57.20 or greater, 0.2255; (b)
if the Parent Common Stock Value is less than $57.20 but greater than $46.80,
the quotient, calculated to the nearest one-ten thousandth, resulting from
dividing $12.90 by the Parent Common Stock Value; or (c) if the Parent Common
Stock Value is $46.80 or less, 0.2756. "Parent Common Stock Value" means the
average closing sale prices for a share of Parent Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") Composite Transactions Tape (as reported by The
Wall Street Journal (Northeast edition), or, if not reported thereby, as
reported by any other authoritative source) for each of the ten consecutive
trading days ending with the second complete trading day prior to the Closing
Date (not counting the Closing Date). The Parent Stock Consideration using
the Exchange Ratio shall be calculated to the nearest one-ten thousandth of a
share of Parent Stock and the Parent Common Stock Value shall be calculated
to the nearest one-tenth of one cent. The Cash Consideration and the Parent
Stock Consideration to be received by the holders of Common Stock hereunder
(together with the cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock as
specified below) are referred to herein collectively as the "Merger
Consideration".   (b) All shares of Common Stock (other than shares to be
cancelled in accordance with Section 2.2(c)) shall cease to be outstanding
and shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of shares of
Common Stock (other than Merger Sub and Parent) shall thereafter cease to
have any rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock, except, subject
to Section 2.5, the right to receive, without interest, the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.4 upon the surrender of a
certificate or certificates (a "Certificate") representing such shares of
Common Stock.   (c) Each share of Common Stock issued and held in the
Company\'s treasury at the Effective Time, or held by Merger Sub or Parent,
shall, by virtue of the Merger, cease to be outstanding and shall be
cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor.   2.3 Company
Stock Options. Each Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time and
in exchange therefor, the holder of such Company Stock Option shall be
entitled to receive, in consideration for the cancellation of such Company
Stock Option and net of applicable withholding Taxes, the
Option Consideration (if any). The Company shall take any and all action, as
may be necessary, to effectuate the foregoing, including without limitation
adopting any plan amendments and obtaining any required consents.   (i) For
purposes of this Agreement, "Option Consideration" means (x) an amount of
cash equal to the positive difference, if any, between the Total Cash
Consideration, less the Total Cash Exercise Price; and (y) the number
of shares of Parent Stock equal to the positive difference, if any, between
the Total Stock Consideration less the Total Parent Stock Exercise Price.  
(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, "Total Cash Consideration" means the
product of (x) the Cash Consideration multiplied by (y) the number of shares
of Company Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time.   (iii) For purposes of this Agreement, "Total Stock
Consideration" means the product of (x) the Parent Stock Consideration
multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (iv) For
purposes of this Agreement, "Total Cash Exercise Price" means the product of
(x) the aggregate exercise price of such Company Stock Option, multiplied by
(y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Consideration, and the
denominator of which is the sum of (A) the Cash Consideration and (B) the
product of the Parent Stock Consideration multiplied by the Parent
Common Stock Value.   (v) For purposes of this Agreement, "Total Parent
Stock Exercise Price" means (A) the aggregate exercise price of such Company
Stock Option, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the product
of the Parent Stock Consideration and the Parent Common Stock Value and the
denominator of which is the sum of the Cash Consideration and product of the
Parent Stock Consideration and the Parent Common Stock Value, divided by (B)
the Parent Common Stock Value.   2.4 Exchange of Certificates Representing
Common Stock. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial
bank or trust company, subject to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company,
to act as Exchange Agent hereunder for the purpose of paying, in accordance
with this Article 2, the Cash Consideration and exchanging, in accordance
with this Article 2, Certificates for the Parent Stock Consideration (the
"Exchange Agent"). Parent shall take all steps necessary to cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide the Exchange Agent with the Merger
Consideration to be delivered in exchange for all the shares of Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.2(a) as and when such amounts are needed by the
Exchange Agent.   (b) As promptly as possible after the Effective Time,
Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
shares of Common Stock: (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificate(s)
shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent
and which letter shall be in such form and have such other provisions as are
customary for letters of this nature and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of such Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Upon surrender of such Certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent together with
such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate(s) shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate (or evidence of shares
in book entry form) representing that number of whole shares of Parent Stock
and the amount of cash, without interest, into which shares of Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate(s) shall have been converted into
the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2 after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings, and the shares formerly represented by the
Certificate(s) so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If any portion of
the Parent Stock Consideration is to be registered in the name of a Person
other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition to the registration of such shares
constituting such Parent Stock Consideration that the surrendered Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
the Person requesting such delivery of such shares shall pay to the Exchange
Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of such registration in
the name of a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not applicable. No interest will be paid or will accrue
on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate(s), including in lieu
of any fractional shares of Parent Stock. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company, payment may be made with respect to such Common Stock to such a
transferee if such Certificate(s) representing such shares of Common Stock is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable transfer or other Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.4(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the amount of Parent Stock and cash, without interest, into
which the shares of Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate(s) shall have been converted pursuant to this Article 2. Except
to the extent that the holder provides the appropriate party with a validly
executed IRS Form W-8 or W-9, as the case may be, Parent, Merger Sub or the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Common Stock of the Company such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub or
the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and the regulations promulgated thereunder
(the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with
respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so
withheld by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of shares of Common Stock of the Company in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent.   (c) All shares of Parent Stock issued and all cash paid upon
surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article 2
shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Common Stock theretofore represented by
such Certificates. At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the
shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Article 2.   (d) No dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.4(e)
until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article 2.
Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate
representing whole shares of Parent Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(e) and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Stock and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Stock.   (e) No certificates or script, or evidence of shares in book
entry form, representing fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of Parent. Each holder of Common Stock exchanged pursuant to
the Merger who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Parent Stock shall receive, upon surrender of such holder\'s Certificates
in accordance with this Section 2.4, an amount in cash (without interest)
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) such fractional share
interest to which such holder (after taking into account all fractional share
interests then held by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the
average of the per share closing sales prices of shares of Parent Stock as
reported on the NYSE Composite Transactions reporting system (as reported in
The Wall Street Journal or, in the absence thereof, by another authoritative
source) during the five (5) consecutive trading days ending on (and
including) the trading day immediately preceding the date of the Effective
Time. As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional share interests, the
Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall deposit such amount
with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward
payments to such holders of fractional share interests subject to and in
accordance with the terms of Section 2.4(b).   (f) Any portion of the Merger
Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.4(a)
(including the proceeds of any interest and other income received by the
Exchange Agent in respect of all such funds) that remains undistributed to
the former shareholders of the Company six (6) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand. Any former shareholders of
the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2, with
respect to the procedures for receiving the Merger Consideration to which
they are entitled, shall thereafter look only to the Parent for payment of
any Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, that may be payable
in respect of each share of Common Stock such shareholder held as of the
Effective Time as determined pursuant to this Agreement.   (g) None of
Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any
other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Common Stock
for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.   (h) In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim which may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.   (i)
Parent or Merger Sub shall pay all of the Exchange Agent\'s fees
in connection with the exchange of the Merger Consideration for
Certificates.   2.5 Adjustment of Merger Consideration. In the event that,
subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Common Stock or Parent Stock shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class as a result of a stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
split, combination, exchange, recapitalization or other similar transaction,
the Exchange Ratio and Cash Consideration shall be appropriately
adjusted.   2.6 Dissenting Company Shareholders. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent permitted by the
MBCL, shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders of such shares of
Common Stock who are entitled to demand and properly demand payment of the
fair value of such Common Stock pursuant to Section 351.455 of the MBCL (the
"Dissenting Common Stock") will not be converted into, or represent the right
to receive, the Merger Consideration. Holders of such shares of Dissenting
Common Stock will be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting
Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of such Section 351.455 unless
and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or lose their
rights to appraisal and payment under the MBCL. If, after the Effective Time,
any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such
right, such shares of Dissenting Common Stock will thereupon be treated as if
they had been converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon, upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with
Section 2.4. The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt notice of any demands
for payment of fair value received by the Company pursuant to Section 351.455
of the MBCL, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to Section 354.455 of the MBCL and received by the Company and (ii)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any such demand for payment of fair value under the MBCL. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to any demands for payment of fair value or offer to settle or settle
any such demands.   ARTICLE 3  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY   Subject to such exceptions as are disclosed in the
corresponding sections of the disclosure schedule which is attached hereto
and made a part hereof (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") (it being
understood that (a) the disclosure of any fact or item in any section of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall, should the existence of such fact or item
be relevant to any other section, be deemed to be disclosed with respect to
that other section so long as the relevance of such disclosure to such other
section is reasonably apparent, and (b) the disclosure of any matter or item
in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an
acknowledgement that such matter or item is required to be disclosed therein
or is material to a representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement
and shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material,"
"materially," "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" or any word
or phrase of similar import and does not mean that such matter or item would,
alone or together with any other matter or item, could reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, as defined in Section 8.7), the
Company hereby represents and warrants to each of Parent and Merger Sub as of
the date of this Agreement as follows:   3.1 Organization and Qualification.
Each of the Company and each subsidiary of the Company (each, a "Subsidiary")
is a corporation, limited partnership or limited liability company duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite corporate, limited
liability company, or partnership (as the case may be) power and authority
and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted except
for such governmental approvals, the absence of which, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Subsidiary is duly qualified or
licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
and in good standing has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to
have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.   3.2 Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws. The Company has made available to Parent (i) all minute books of the
Company and each Subsidiary since March 5, 2002, which are complete and
correct, and (ii) a complete and correct copy of the Articles of
Incorporation and the Bylaws (or similar organizational documents), each as
amended to date, of the Company and each Subsidiary. Such Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws (or similar organizational documents) are in full
force and effect.   3.3 Capitalization.   (a) The authorized capital stock
of the Company consists of 85,000,000 shares of Common Stock. As of the date
hereof, (i) 41,788,943 shares of Common Stock were issued and outstanding

and were issued free of preemptive (or similar) rights, (ii) no shares of
Common Stock were held in the treasury of the Company, (iii) no shares of
Common Stock were held by the Subsidiaries, (iv) 4,832,019 shares of Common
Stock were reserved for future issuance in connection with the exercise of
each option (a "Company Stock Option") issued pursuant to any stock option
plan, agreement or commitment maintained by the Company (other than the ESOP,
the SPPND, and the ESSP as each is defined below) (the "Company Stock Option
Plans") (including shares reserved pursuant to outstanding Company Stock
Options), (v) no shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance in
connection with the Company\'s Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP"),
(vi) 70,420 shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance under the

"SPPND") and (vii) 1,333,418 shares of Common Stock were reserved
for issuance under the Company\'s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (of which no
shares will be issued following the date hereof) (the "ESPP" and, together
with the Company Stock Option Plans, the ESOP and SPPND, the "Company Stock
Plans"). Section 3.3(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as
of the Capitalization Date, each Company Stock Option and other right to
purchase or receive shares of Common Stock under the Company Stock Plans, the
expiration date, grant date, vesting commencement date, vesting schedule,
type of option and the exercise price of each such Company Stock Option
(including whether the exercise price was less than the fair market value of
the underlying Shares on the date of grant) or right and the number of Shares
issuable under each Company Stock Option.   (b) Except as set forth in
Section 3.3(b), or as set forth in Section 3.3(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there are no (i) subscriptions, calls, contracts, options, warrants
or other rights, agreements, arrangements, understandings, restrictions or
commitments of any character to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a
party or by which the Company or any Subsidiary is bound relating to the
issued or unissued capital stock or equity interests of the Company or any
Subsidiary or obligating the Company or any Subsidiary to issue or sell any
shares of capital stock of, other equity interests in or debt securities of,
the Company or any Subsidiary (including any rights plan or agreement), (ii)

exercisable for shares of capital stock or equity interests of the Company or
any Subsidiary, or (iii) equity equivalents, stock appreciation rights or

Company or any Subsidiary or similar rights. All shares of Common
Stock subject to issuance as set forth in Section 3.3(a), upon issuance on
the terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they
are issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and free of preemptive (or similar) rights. There are no
outstanding contractual obligations or rights of the Company or any
Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any securities or
equity interests of the Company or any Subsidiary to vote or to dispose of
any shares of capital stock or equity interests of the Company or any
Subsidiary. Except as set forth in Section 3.3(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, none of the Company or any Subsidiary nor, to the knowledge of the
Company, any other Person is a party to any shareholders\' agreement, voting
trust agreement or registration rights agreement relating to any equity
securities or equity interests of the Company or any Subsidiary or any other
contract relating to disposition, voting or dividends with respect to, or
bound by, any equity securities or equity interests of the Company or of any
Subsidiary. No dividends on the Common Stock have been declared or paid since
July 31, 2005. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock have
been issued by the Company in compliance with applicable federal and state
securities Laws. There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries having the right to
vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right
to vote) on any matter for which the Company\'s shareholders may vote.  
(c) Each outstanding share of capital stock (or other unit of
equity interest) of each Subsidiary is duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and was issued free of preemptive (or similar) rights,
and each such share or unit is owned by the Company, by one or more wholly
owned Subsidiaries of the Company, or by the Company and one or more wholly-
owned Subsidiaries of the Company, free and clear of all options, rights of
first refusal, agreements, limitations on the Company\'s or any Subsidiary\'s
voting, dividend or transfer rights, charges and other encumbrances or Liens
of any nature whatsoever. A true and complete list of all the Subsidiaries of
the Company together with the jurisdiction of incorporation of each
Subsidiary is set forth in Section 3.3(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.   (d) Section 3.3(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule also lists
any and all Persons of which the Company directly or indirectly owns an
equity or similar interest, or an interest convertible into or exchangeable
or exercisable for an equity or similar interest, of any Person which is not
a Subsidiary (collectively, the "Investments"). The Company or a Subsidiary,
as the case may be, owns all Investments free and clear of all Liens, and
there are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any
Subsidiary permitting the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition of any
of its interest in the Investments or requiring the Company or any Subsidiary
to provide funds to, make any investment (in the form of a loan,
capital contribution or otherwise) in, provide any guarantee with respect to,
or assume, endorse or otherwise become responsible for the obligations of,
any Investment (or any Person in which such Investment is made).   3.4
Authority Relative to This Agreement. The Company has all necessary corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated by the Company or the
Surviving Corporation (the "Other Transactions"). The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by
the Company of the Merger and the Other Transactions have been duly and
validly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the Merger or such Other Transactions (other
than the adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders
of two-thirds of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to
vote thereon (the "Company Shareholder Approval") and the filing and
recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the MBCL). This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and
Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the
effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including all Laws relating
to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws
affecting creditors\' rights generally and subject to the effect of general
principles of equity.   3.5 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.  
(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the Merger and the Other Transactions will not, (i) assuming the
approval of the agreement by the shareholders of the Company as required
by the MBCL, conflict with, violate or result in a breach of the Articles
of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company (or similar organizational
documents of any Subsidiary), (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals and
other authorizations described in Section 3.5(b) have been obtained, that all
filings and other actions described in Section 3.5(b) have been made or
taken, and that the Company pays off in full at Closing the outstanding

or violate any U.S. federal, state or local or foreign statute, law,
ordinance, regulation, rule, code, executive order, judgment, decree or other
order ("Law") applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary or by which any
property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary is bound or affected, or
(iii) result in any breach or violation of or constitute a default (or an
event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default)
under, require consent or result in a loss of a benefit under, give rise to
an obligation under, give to others any right of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any
property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to, any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit,
franchise or other binding commitment, instrument or obligation (each, a
"Contract") to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which the
Company or a Subsidiary or any property or asset of the Company or any
Subsidiary is bound or affected, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and
(iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other
occurrences which have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (b) The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement by the
Company and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the Other
Transactions will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit
of, or filing with or notification to, any supranational, national,
provincial, federal, state or local or government, regulatory or
administrative authority, or any court, tribunal, or judicial or arbitral
body (a "Governmental Authority"), except for (i) applicable requirements of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), (ii)
the pre-merger notification requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), and the competition or
Merger Control Laws of any other applicable jurisdiction, (iii) the
notification requirements of the Investment Canada Act (R.S. 1985, c. 28 (1st
Supp.), as amended (the "ICA"), (iv) the filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") of the Joint Proxy Statement, (v) any filings
required by, and any approvals required under, the rules and regulations of
the Nasdaq National Market, (vi) the filing and recordation of appropriate
merger documents as required by the MBCL, (vii) any novations, consents or
approvals required in connection with Government Contracts or similar
novations, consents or approvals under any other Contracts with any other
Governmental Authorities, (viii) any filings required under the
DOD Industrial Security Manual for Safeguarding Classified Information, and
(ix) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations
or permits, or to make such filing or notifications would not (a) prevent
or materially delay the consummation of the Merger, or (b) otherwise prevent
or materially delay performance by the Company of any of its material
obligations under the Agreement.   3.6 Permits; Compliance.   (a) Each of
the Company and each Subsidiary is in possession of all franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority
necessary for each such entity to own, lease and operate its properties or to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted (the "Company Permits")
and no default has occurred under any such Company Permit, and no written
notice of violation has been received from any Governmental Authority, except
where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, or defaults
under, or violations of, any Company Permit have not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the
date hereof, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any written
notification from any Governmental Authority threatening to revoke any such
Person\'s material Company Permit.   (b) To the knowledge of the Company,
each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (with respect
to matters relating to the Company\'s business) is, and at all times has
been, in compliance in all material respects with any Law applicable to such
Person or Affiliate or by which any property or asset of such entity is bound
or affected, and has not received written notice of any violation of any such
Law.   (c) Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and
the related rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Sarbanes-
Oxley Act"), the Company has been and is in compliance in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The
Company has designed and implemented disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
is made known on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the
preparation of the Company\'s filings with the SEC and other public
disclosure documents.   (d) The Company has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation, to the Company\'s auditors and the audit committee of the
Board of Directors of the Company (i) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect the Company\'s ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (ii) any fraud or allegation of fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Company\'s internal controls over financial
reporting. True, correct and complete copies of any written reports or other
correspondence with respect to such disclosures (whether prepared by the
Company, its counsel or other advisors) have been provided to Parent prior to
the date of this Agreement, except in any instances where providing such
reports or other correspondence would constitute a waiver of applicable
attorney-client privilege (in which case Parent has been advised of the
subject matter thereof).   (e) The Company has not received any complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim in writing regarding the accounting practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or its internal
accounting controls, which deals with any matter that would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the
Company, there is no reason to believe that its auditors and its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act when
next due.   (f) Since October 1, 2003, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has effected any securitization transaction or other "off-
balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K of the
SEC).   3.7 SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities.
The Company has filed all forms, reports, statements, schedules,
certifications and other documents required to be filed by it with the SEC
since November 1, 2001 (collectively, the "SEC Reports"). As of their
respective dates, the SEC Reports (including any documents or information
incorporated by reference therein and including any financial statements or
schedules included therein) (i) complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, in each
case, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and (ii) did not, at
the time they were filed, or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary is or has been required to file any
form, report, statement, schedule, certification or other document with the
SEC.   (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in
each case, any notes and schedules thereto) contained in the SEC Reports
was prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the
case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and the
requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act) and each fairly
presents, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position,
results of operations, shareholders\' equity and cash flows of the Company
and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and for
the respective periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to the absence of footnotes and to normal and recurring year-end
adjustments). All of the Subsidiaries are consolidated for accounting
purposes.   (c) Except as set forth in the SEC Reports, and to the extent
set forth on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as at October 31, 2004, included in the Company\'s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004,
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any liability or obligation of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), except for
liabilities and obligations (i) incurred in the ordinary course of business
and in a manner consistent with past practice since October 31, 2004, or (ii)
the obligations to pay fees and expenses to the Company\'s attorneys,
accountants and the Company Financial Advisor relating to the obligations
contemplated by this Agreement. None of the liabilities or obligations
contemplated by the preceding sentence have had, individually or in the
aggregate, or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. As of the date hereof, the aggregate amount of all Indebtedness of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than any Indebtedness owed by the
Company to any Subsidiary or any Subsidiary to the Company or another
Subsidiary) does not exceed $75 million.   3.8 Affiliate Transactions.
Except as set forth in Section 3.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there
are no transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings between (i)
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and (ii) any
Affiliate of the Company (other than any of its Subsidiaries), on the other
hand.   3.9 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as set forth
in Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, since October 31, 2004,
there has not occurred any Company Material Adverse Effect, or any
event, circumstance or occurrence that has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since October 31, 2004,
except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the Company and the
Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses only in the ordinary course of
business and in a manner consistent with past practice and (b) neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has taken any action or agreed to take any action
that would be prohibited by clauses (i) through (xviii) of Section 5.2(b)
taken after the date hereof other than in the ordinary course of business and
in a manner consistent with past practice.   3.10 Absence of Litigation.
Except as set forth in Section 3.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and
excluding workers\' compensation claims for which the Company is insured or
has recorded adequate reserves in its financial statements to cover such
claims, there is no litigation, suit, claim, action, proceeding, hearing,
petition, grievance, complaint, charge or investigation (an "Action") pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (with respect to matters relating to the
Company\'s business), or any property or asset of the Company or any
Subsidiary, or to the knowledge of the Company, or any officer, director
or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (with
respect to matters relating to the Company\'s business), before any
Governmental Authority or arbitrator. Except as set forth in Section 3.10 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates (with respect to matters relating to the
Company\'s business) nor any property or asset of the Company or of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates (with respect to matters relating to the
Company\'s business) is subject to any order, writ, judgment, injunction,
decree, determination or award of, or, to the knowledge of the Company, any
investigation by, any Governmental Authority.   3.11 Employee Benefit Plans.

have any obligation or which are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by
the Company, any ERISA Affiliate or any Subsidiary for the benefit of any
current or former employee, consultant, officer or director of the Company or
any Subsidiary (collectively, the "Plans"). The Company has made available to
Merger Sub a true and complete copy (where applicable) of (i) each Plan (or,
where a Plan has not been reduced to writing, a summary of all material Plan
terms of such Plan), (ii) each trust or funding arrangement prepared in
connection with each such Plan, (iii) the annual report on Internal Revenue
Service ("IRS") Form 5500 or any other annual report required by applicable
Law for the three (3) most recent plan years, (iv) the most recently received

actuarial reports and financial statements prepared in connection with each
such Plan, and (vi) the most recent summary plan description, any summaries

communications (or a description of any material oral communications) by the
Company or the Subsidiaries to any current or former employees, consultants,
or directors of the Company or any Subsidiary concerning the extent of the
benefits provided under a Plan. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
any plan or commitment to establish any new material Plan or to materially
modify any Plan.   (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company or any Subsidiary or any other
Person or entity that, together with the Company or any Subsidiary, is or was
treated as a single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the
Code (each, together with the Company and any Subsidiary, an "ERISA
Affiliate"), has now or at any time within the past six years (and in the
case of any such other Person or entity, only during the period within the
past six years that such other Person or entity was an ERISA Affiliate)
contributed to, sponsored, or maintained: (i) a pension plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title
IV of ERISA (each, a "Pension Plan"); (ii) a multiemployer plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or the comparable provisions
of any other applicable Law) (a "Multiemployer Plan"); or (iii) a single
employer pension plan (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA)
for which an ERISA Affiliate would reasonably be expected to incur liability
under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer Plan"). Except as
set forth on Section 3.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (each, a
"Change in Control Agreement"), no Plan exists that would result in the
payment to any present or former employee, director or consultant of the
Company or any Subsidiary of any money or other property or result in the
forgiveness of indebtedness or accelerate or provide any other rights or
benefits to any current or former employee, director or consultant of the
Company or any Subsidiary as a result of the consummation of the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or in
connection with any other event). No payment or other benefit that has been
or may be made to any current or former employee or independent contractor of
the Company or any Subsidiary under any Plan, employment, severance or
termination agreement, other compensation arrangement or employee benefit
plan or arrangement with the Company or any Subsidiary may be characterized
as an "excess parachute payment," as such term is defined in Section 280G of
the Code and no such Plan, arrangement or agreement provides for, or provided
for, the payment by the Company or any Subsidiary of any amount that is not
or was not reasonably deductible under Section 162(m) or Section 404 of the
Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates is required to provide any "gross up" payments to any employee or
service provider with respect to any tax imposed under section 4999 of the
Code.   (c) Each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS that
the Plan is so qualified, and each trust established in connection with any
Plan which is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under
Section 501(a) of the Code has received a determination letter from the IRS
that it is so exempt, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or
circumstance exists that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of any such Plan or the exempt status of any such trust. The
ESOP is a duly organized, validly existing employee stock ownership plan
under Section 407 of ERISA and Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code and is not a
party to any outstanding loans.   (d) (i) Each Plan and each related trust
agreement, annuity Contract or funding instrument has been established and
administered, both as to form and operation, in accordance with its terms,
and in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other
applicable Laws, except to the extent such noncompliance has not had, and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
and (ii) except as set forth in Section 3.11(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no Plan provides post-termination or retiree welfare benefits, and
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any obligation to provide any
post-termination benefits other than for health care continuation as required
by Section 4980B of the Code or any similar statute. All obligations to be
performed at or prior to the Closing Date with respect to each Plan
(including, without limitation, those with respect to the making or payment
of contributions or premiums, as applicable) have been or will have been
performed in accordance with the relevant terms of each Plan and all
applicable Law, and no taxes are owing or exigible under any Plan;   (e)
With respect to any Plan, except as set forth in Section 3.11(e) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, (i) no Actions (other than routine claims for
benefits in the ordinary course) are pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened, except for those that have not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii)
to the knowledge of the Company, no facts or circumstances exist that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any such Actions, and (iii) no

progress or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, except for those
that have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.   (f) Section 3.11(f) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of each Plan that is not
subject to United States Law (each such Plan, a "Foreign Benefit Plan").
Without limiting the representations set forth in Section 3.11(a) through
(e), except as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a
Company Material Adverse effect: (i) all employer and employee contributions
to each Foreign Benefit Plan required by Law or by the terms of such Foreign
Benefit Plan have been made or, if applicable, accrued in accordance with
normal accounting practices; (ii) the fair market value of the assets of each
funded Foreign Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign
Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any
Foreign Benefit Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient
to procure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the date of
this Agreement, with respect to all current and former participants in such
plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used
and consistent with applicable Law to determine employer contributions to
such Foreign Benefit Plan and no transaction contemplated by this Agreement
shall cause such assets, reserve or insurance obligations to be less than
such benefit obligations; (iii) each Foreign Benefit Plan required to be
registered has been registered and has been maintained in good standing with
applicable regulatory authorities; (iv) each Foreign Benefit Plan is in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws; and (v) no
Foreign Benefit Plan is a registered pension plan for purposes of applicable
Canadian Law.   (g) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, any fiduciary of any Plan has any material
liability with respect to any transaction in violation of Section 404 or 406
of ERISA or any "prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 4975(c)(1) of
the Code, for which no exemption exists under Section 408 of ERISA or Section
4975(c)(2) or (d) of the Code.   (h) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(h)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company represents as follows:  
(i) The funding method used in connection with each Pension Plan which is
subject to the minimum funding requirements of ERISA is acceptable and
the actuarial assumptions used in connection with funding each such plan
are reasonable. The Company has provided Parent with a true and correct copy
of the most recent actuarial valuation for each Pension Plan. Nothing has
occurred since the date of such reports that would materially and adversely
affect the funded status of each Pension Plan as reflected in such reports.
No "accumulated funding deficiency" (for which an excise tax is due or would
be due in the absence of a waiver) as defined in Section 412 of the Code or
as defined in Section 302(a)(2) of ERISA, whichever may apply, has been
incurred with respect to any Pension Plan with respect to any plan year,
whether or not waived. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has failed
to pay when due any "required installment," within the meaning of Section
412(m) of the Code and Section 302(e) of ERISA, whichever may apply, with
respect to any Pension Plan. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is
subject to any lien imposed under Section 412(n) of the Code or Section
302(f) of ERISA, whichever may apply, with respect to any Pension Plan.
Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any liability for unpaid
contributions that are payable currently with respect to any Pension Plan.
Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is required to provide security
to a Pension Plan which covers or has covered employees or former employees
of the Company or a Subsidiary under Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.   (ii)
The Company has paid all premiums (and interest charges and penalties for
late payment, if applicable) due the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation
(the "PBGC") with respect to each Pension Plan for each plan year thereof for
which such premiums are required. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
has engaged in, or is a successor or parent corporation to an entity that has
engaged in, a transaction described in Section 4069 of ERISA. There has been
no "reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043(b) of ERISA and the PBGC
regulations under such Section) with respect to any Pension Plan. No filing
has been made by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate with the PBGC, and no
proceeding has been commenced by the PBGC, to terminate any Pension Plan.
To the knowledge of the Company, no condition exists and no event has
occurred that could constitute grounds for the termination of any Pension
Plan by the PBGC. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has, at any
time, (A) ceased operations at a facility so as to become subject to the
provisions of Section 4068(e) of ERISA, (B) withdrawn as a substantial
employer so as to become subject to the provisions of Section 4063 of ERISA,
or (C) ceased making contributions on or before the Closing Date to any
Pension Plan subject to Section 4064(a) of ERISA to which the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate made contributions during the six years prior to the Closing
Date.   3.12 Labor and Employment Matters. Section 3.12 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth all collective bargaining agreements
to which or by which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or bound (the
"Collective Bargaining Agreements"). Other than the Collective Bargaining
Agreements, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is, or at any time has
been, a party to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement or other
labor union agreements applicable to Persons employed by the Company or any
Subsidiary, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, are there any such
employees represented by a labor union, works council or other labor
organization or activities or proceedings of any labor union, works council
or group of employees to organize any such employees. The Company has
delivered or made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of
each Collective Bargaining Agreement, as amended to date. Neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary party thereto nor, to the knowledge of the Company, the
other party or parties thereto, is in breach of any term of any such
Collective Bargaining Agreement. From January 1, 2003 to the date of this
Agreement, there has been no actual or, to the knowledge of the Company or
any Subsidiary, threatened work stoppage, slowdown, labor strike, lockout or
labor dispute against or affecting the Company or any Subsidiary. The Company
and its Subsidiaries (a) have no direct or indirect liability with respect to
any misclassification of any Persons as an independent contractor rather than
as an employee, except for those misclassifications that have not had, and
would not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect,
(b) are in material compliance with all applicable Laws respecting
employment, employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and
wages and hours, and (c) have complied in all material respects with
Executive Order 11246 and any similar Laws regarding affirmative action and

or any Subsidiary (the "Owned Properties"). There are no material leases,
subleases, licenses, occupancy agreements, options, rights, concessions or
other agreements or arrangements, written or oral, granting to any Person the

3.13(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists by address each parcel of
real property leased or subleased by the Company or any Subsidiary for which

copies of all agreements under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
leases or subleases, together with all amendments and assignments, the Leased
Properties have been provided or made available to Parent and Merger Sub. To
the extent that any Person other than the Company or its Subsidiaries has a
right to use or occupy any portion of any of the Leased Properties,
such right(s) would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Except as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected
to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) each agreement under which
the Company or any Subsidiaries leases or subleases the Leased Properties is
a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company or such Subsidiary, as
applicable, in full force and effect and enforceable against the Company or
such Subsidiary in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including all Laws relating to fraudulent
transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors\'
rights generally and subject to the effect of general principles of equity,
(ii) to the knowledge of the Company, each such agreement is a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the counterparty thereto, in full force and effect
and enforceable against such counterparty in accordance with its terms, and
(iii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is and, to the
Company\'s knowledge, no counterparty is, in breach or violation of, or in
default under, any such agreement.   (c) The Company or one of its

Properties, free and clear of all Liens, except (i) Liens for current taxes

repairmen\'s, warehousemen\'s and carriers\' Liens arising in the ordinary
course of business of the Company or such Subsidiary consistent with past
practice if the underlying obligations are not more than 30 days past due or
are being contested in good faith, and (iv) all Liens and other imperfections
of title (including matters of record) and encumbrances that do not
materially interfere with the conduct of the businesses of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (collectively, "Permitted
Liens"). Except as set forth in Section 3.13(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there are no material pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened condemnation proceedings with respect to any Property or
litigation or administrative actions relating to any Property.   3.14

be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, to the knowledge of

in, the conduct of the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries, and (ii)
the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted does not infringe upon, misappropriate or violate ("Infringe") any
Intellectual Property of any third party. Except as has not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, no
claim or demand has been given in writing to the Company or any Subsidiary
that the conduct of the business of the Company or any Subsidiary Infringes
upon or may Infringe upon the Intellectual Property rights of any third party
(including any demand that the Company or a Subsidiary must license or
refrain from using any Intellectual Property of a third party).   (b)
Section 3.14(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of all Intellectual Property rights which are either registered
or have been applied for and are currently owned by the Company and its
Subsidiaries that are material to the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (collectively, "Scheduled
Intellectual Property"). Each item listed on Section 3.14(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule has been duly registered or application filed with the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or such other governmental or organizational
authority. Except as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to
have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, to the knowledge of the Company, all
patent, copyright, and trademark applications, renewals and other similar
fees have been properly paid and are current, and all patent, copyright, and
trademark registrations and filings remain in full force and effect. There
are no actual or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened opposition
proceedings, reexamination proceedings, cancellation proceedings,
interference proceedings or other similar actions challenging the validity,
existence, ownership of any portion of the Scheduled Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property which should have been listed in Section 3.14(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the
Scheduled Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property which should have
been listed in Section 3.14(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule has been
previously adjudged to be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part.  
(c) With respect to the Intellectual Property rights that are owned by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are material to the business of

such Owned Intellectual Property and is entitled to make, use, offer for

Property in the continued operation of its respective business consistent
with past practice. To the knowledge of the Company, (i) no Person has or is
engaged in any activity that has Infringed upon the Owned Intellectual
Property, and (ii) the Company has not performed any acts or made any
statements, or failed to perform any acts or make any statements, which would
adversely affect either the validity or enforceability of any of the Owned
Intellectual Property against any Person. Except as has not had, and would
reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary has exclusively licensed any Owned
Intellectual Property to any Person.   (d) Except as has not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, to the
knowledge of the Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries use the
Intellectual Property of third parties only pursuant to valid, effective
written License Agreements (collectively, the "Third Party Licenses") that
will allow the continued operation of material aspects of the Company\'s
business consistent with past practice. Section 3.14(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all third party
software contained in the Owned Intellectual Property (as defined above)
that, if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries did not have the right to
make, use, offer for sale, sell, import, license, transfer, sublicense, and
otherwise exploit, would have, or could reasonably be expected to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   (e) The Company and its Subsidiaries have
taken commercially reasonable actions to protect, preserve, and maintain the
secrecy of the Owned Intellectual Property that is not the subject of any
patent, copyright, or trademark registration as a trade secret under
applicable Law ("Trade Secrets") and to maintain the confidentiality of and
restrict the improper use of the Trade Secrets. Without limitation, such
reasonable actions have included requiring employees and consultants to enter

or consultants have worked with or have developed any part of the Owned
Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of the Company, (i) there has been no
unauthorized disclosure of any of the Trade Secrets, and (ii) there has been
no material breach of the Company\'s or any Subsidiary\'s security procedures
wherein any of the Trade Secrets has been improperly disclosed to a third

Company or any of its Subsidiaries to own or use any of the material
Intellectual Property.   (g) For purposes of this Agreement, "Intellectual

acknowledgement that such matter or item is required to be disclosed therein
or is material to a representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement
and shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material,"

or phrase of similar import and does not mean that such matter or item would,
alone or together with any other matter or item, could reasonably be expected

and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to the Company as follows:  
4.1 Organization and Qualification. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and each other

existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and authority and
all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties

Merger and the Other Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and
Merger Sub of the Merger and the Other Transactions have been duly and
validly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Parent and Merger Sub are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Merger or such Other
Transactions (other than the authorization and approval of the issuance of

provided, that the total votes cast represents over 50% in interest of all
securities entitled to vote, as required by the Listed Company Manual of the

Merger Sub, enforceable each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its

Filings and Consents.   (a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent

consent or result in a loss of a benefit under, give rise to an obligation
under, give to others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset
of Parent, Merger Sub, or any Parent Subsidiary, pursuant to any Contract to
which Parent, Merger Sub, or any Parent Subsidiary is a party, or by which
Parent, Merger Sub, or any Parent Subsidiary, or any property or asset of
Parent, Merger Sub, or any Parent Subsidiary, is bound or affected, except,
with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations,
breaches, defaults or other occurrences which have not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (b) The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do not, and
the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the

obligations under the Agreement.   4.5 Interim Operations of Merger Sub.

(including any documents or information incorporated by reference therein and
including any financial statements or schedules included therein) (i)
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, in each case,
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and (ii) did not at the time

any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Since March 31, 2005, there has not been any event or state of
facts that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   4.9 Information Supplied. The
information supplied or to be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement and the Joint

thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to the shareholders of the
Company and Parent and (iii) the time of the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting,

and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and the Exchange

no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect
to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Registration Statement or Joint Proxy Statement.   4.10
Absence of Litigation. Except as set forth in the Parent SEC Reports or
Section 4.10 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there is no Action pending
or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of
the Parent Subsidiaries, or any property or asset of Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary, or, to the knowledge of Parent, any officer, director or
employee of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, before any Governmental
Authority or arbitrator, except as has not, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in
Section 4.10 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, neither Parent nor any of the
Parent Subsidiaries nor any property or asset of Parent or of the Parent
Subsidiaries is subject to any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree,
determination or award of, or, to the knowledge of Parent, any investigation
by, any Governmental Authority.   4.11 Compliance.   (a) To the knowledge
Parent, each of Parent and each of the Parent Subsidiaries is, and at all
times has been, in compliance in all material respects with any Law
applicable to such entity or by which any property or asset of such entity is
bound or affected, and has not received written notice of any violation of
any such Law.   (b) Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Parent
has been and is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parent has designed and implemented
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to Parent,
including its consolidated Parent Subsidiaries, is made known on a timely
basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of Parent\'s filings
with the SEC and other public disclosure documents.   (c) Parent has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation, to Parent\'s auditors and the
audit committee of the Board of Directors of Parent (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect Parent\'s ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud or allegation
of fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in Parent\'s internal controls
over financial reporting. True, correct and complete copies of any written
reports or other correspondence with respect to such disclosures (whether
prepared by Parent, its counsel or other advisors) have been made available
to the Company prior to the date of this Agreement, except in any instances
where providing such reports or other correspondence would constitute a
waiver of applicable attorney-client privilege (in which case the Company has
been advised of the subject matter thereof).   (d) Parent has not received
any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim in writing regarding the
accounting practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Parent or its
internal accounting controls, which deals with any matter that would
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. To the
knowledge of Parent, there is no reason to believe that its auditors and its
chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give
the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act when
next due.   (e) Since April 1, 2003, neither Parent nor any of the
Parent Subsidiaries has effected any securitization transaction or other
"off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K of
the SEC).   4.12 Certain Business Practices. None of Parent, any of the

of the Parent Subsidiaries: (i) used any funds for unlawful contributions,
gifts, entertainment or other unlawful payments relating to political
activity or (ii) made any unlawful payment to any foreign or domestic
government official or employee or to any foreign or domestic political party
or campaign or violated any provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977, as amended.   4.13 Full Disclosure. No representation or warranty or
other statement made by Parent in this Agreement in connection with the
Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby contains any untrue statement
or omits to state a material fact necessary to make any of them, in light of
the circumstances in which it was made, not misleading.   ARTICLE 5

foregoing, shall not be deemed a breach of any other covenant or agreement of
such party contained in this Agreement.   "Alternative Proposal" means an

registration statement under the Securities Act in connection  therewith; or
(iv) any acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding  shares of capital

exchange, business  combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution
or other  similar transaction, for 100% of then outstanding shares of
Common  Stock or all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the 
Company, which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in  good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor) to be more  favorable
to the Company and the Company\'s shareholders from a  financial point of
view than the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement taking into
account at the time of determination the ability  of the Person making such
proposal to consummate the transactions  contemplated by the proposal (based
upon, among other things, the  availability of financing and the expectation
of obtaining required  approvals).   (b) Except as expressly permitted by
this Section 5.1 and Section 5.3(a)(iii), neither the Board of Directors of

Alternative Proposal and/or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement (each, an

provided, however, that prior to the expiration of the Company Applicable
Period, the Board of Directors of the Company may not (other than as
permitted under Section 5.3(a)(iii)) take any of the actions detailed in
clauses (i) through (iv) above unless it complies with the terms of this
Section 5.1(b) and (A) there is an Alternative Proposal which is a Superior
Proposal, (B) the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that the failure to do so
would result in a breach of the fiduciary duty of the Board of Directors of
the Company to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law, (C) the
Company has provided Parent at least two (2) business days prior written
notice ("Superior Proposal Notice") advising Parent that the Board of
Directors of the Company has received a Superior Proposal which it intends to
accept, specifying the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and
identifying the Person making such Superior Proposal and (D) for a period of
not less than two (2) business days after Parent\'s receipt from the Company
of each Superior Proposal Notice, the Company shall, if requested by Parent,
negotiate in good faith with Parent to revise this Agreement so that the
Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal.   (c) In
addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a) and
(b) above, the Company shall promptly advise Parent of any request for
information involving an Alternate Proposal or possible Alternate Proposal or
the submission or receipt of any Alternative Proposal, or any inquiry with
respect to or which would reasonably be expected to lead to any Alternative

request, Alternative Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall promptly provide
to Parent copies of all written correspondence or other written material,
including material in electronic form, between the Company and any Person
making any such request, Alternative Proposal or inquiry. The Company will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with
respect to any of the foregoing and will promptly request that all Persons
provided confidential information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries
pursuant to a confidentiality, non-disclosure or similar agreement, return to
the Company all of such confidential information, without keeping any copies
thereof (if permissible), in accordance with such confidentiality, non-
disclosure or similar agreements.   (d) The Company agrees that it will
promptly inform it and its Subsidiaries\' respective officers, directors,
representatives and agents of the obligations undertaken in this Section
5.1.   (e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.1 shall prohibit the
Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any required disclosure to the
shareholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Company (after consultation with outside counsel), failure
to so disclose would constitute a violation of applicable Law.   5.2

Person\'s employment or fiduciary duties, against all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including attorneys\'
fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising
out of or pertaining to acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by

shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party; provided, however,
that the Indemnified Party shall be permitted to participate in the defense

Indemnified Party\'s expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is any
conflict between the Surviving Corporation and any Indemnified Parties or
there are additional defenses available to any Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnified Parties shall be permitted to participate in the defense of such
Action with counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel, as accrued and in advance of the final disposition of such

that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any necessary

extent that Indemnified Parties have conflicting interests in the outcome of
such Action.   (c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to keep in
effect in its Amended Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-

Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws that provide for exculpation of
director and officer liability and indemnification (and advancement of
expenses related thereto) of the past and present officers and directors of
the Company to the fullest extent permitted by the MBCL, so long as such
Person is, or has been, acting within the scope of such Person\'s employment
or fiduciary duties, and such provisions shall not be amended except as
either required by applicable Law or to make changes permitted by Law that
would enhance the rights of past or present officers and directors to
exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses.   (d) If Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns:
(i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section
5.8.   (e) The provisions of this Section 5.8 are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives, and shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, pursuant to Law,
contract or otherwise. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses,
including attorneys\' fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing the indemnity obligations provided for in this Section 5.8.   (f)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.8, neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected
without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.   5.9 Benefit Plans.   (a) Except as set forth herein, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume, honor, and

herein shall limit the right of Parent to amend or terminate such Plans in
accordance with their terms.   (b) Parent agrees, for a period of twelve
(12) months following the Effective Time, to provide, or to cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, employees of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation who were employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") with benefits (other
than equity-based benefits and other than individual employment agreements)
that are, in the aggregate, similar to those provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Nothing contained herein shall
require Parent to continue the employment of any employee following the
Effective Time.   (c) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, use all reasonable efforts to give
Continuing Employees full credit for prior service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility and vesting under any employee
benefit plan maintained by Parent except where such crediting would: (i)
result in a duplication of benefits or (ii) otherwise cause Parent or any
employee benefit plan maintained by Parent to accrue or pay for benefits that
relate to any time period prior to the Continuing Employee\'s participation
in such plan.   (d) To the extent permissible under Parent\'s benefit plans,
if a Continuing Employee participates in a benefit plan, other than a long-
term disability plan, of Parent or any of its subsidiaries after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
waive any pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
and provide that any expenses incurred on or before the Effective Time by the
Continuing Employee or the Continuing Employee\'s covered dependent shall be
taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions. The Company agrees to

this Section 5.9(d).   (e) With respect to matters described in this

request of Parent, the Company shall terminate any and all 401(k) Plans of
the Company, effective not later than the day immediately preceding the date

Company shall take all action necessary to terminate the ESPP, in accordance
with section 9.2 of such plan.   5.10 Supplemental Disclosure. The Company

Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied and (ii) any failure of the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any

hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 5.10 shall not have any effect for the purpose of determining

of the parties hereto shall terminate, except the obligations of the parties
pursuant to this Section 7.2 and Sections 5.5(b), 5.6, 7.3, 7.4, 8.5 and 8.6
and except that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any
breach of any covenant or agreement under this Agreement.   7.3 Termination
Fee. If: (a) (i) Parent or the Company, as the case may be, terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Sections 7.1(b)(i), 7.1(c), 7.1(d), or 7.1(h) and (ii)
in case of a termination pursuant to Sections 7.1(b)(i) or 7.1(h) an
Alternative Proposal with respect to the Company shall have been publicly
announced prior to such termination and any merger or
extraordinary transaction is, entered into or consummated by the Company

the Company shall pay to Parent (i) a fee ("Termination Fee"), in cash, equal
to $60 million and (ii) all costs and expenses incurred or payable by or on
behalf of Parent or Merger Sub in connection with or in anticipation of the

if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 7.1(b)(i) or 7.1(h), two
business days after the earlier of the entering into or the consummation of
any merger or extraordinary transaction. The Company acknowledges that the
covenants contained in Section 7.3(a) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement and that without such covenants
Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, in the event the
Company fails to pay to Parent the Termination Fee and Expense Payment,
promptly when due, the Company shall, in addition thereto, pay to Parent all
costs and expenses, including attorneys\' fees and disbursements, incurred in
collecting such Termination Fee and Expense Payment together with interest on
the amount of the Termination Fee and Expense Payment or any unpaid portion
thereof, from the date such payment was due until the date such payment is
received by Parent, accrued at the fluctuating prime rate (as quoted in The
Wall Street Journal) as in effect from time to time during the period.  
7.4 Termination for Failure to Obtain Financing. If this Agreement
is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(j), or by the Company
pursuant to Section 7.1(k), Parent shall pay to the Company the sum of $20
million in cash as liquidated damages. Parent and the Company hereby
acknowledge that the amount of damages which would be incurred by the Company
as a result of such termination are difficult to ascertain, and that the
amount of liquidated damages provided by this Section 7.4 is reasonable.
Except as provided in this Section 7.4, Parent shall not have any liability
to the Company in the event of a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(j). The
payment required to be made by this Section 7.4 shall be made to the Company
within two (2) business days after termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(j) or Section 7.1(k) by wire transfer of immediately available
same day funds to an account designated by the Company prior to and as a
condition to termination pursuant to Section 7.1(j).   7.5 Amendment. To
the extent permitted by applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by
action taken by or on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Company and
Parent at any time before or after (i) approval and adoption of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company or (ii) the authorization and
approval of the issuance of Parent Stock in connection with the Merger by the
shareholders of Parent but, after any such stockholder approval, no amendment
shall be made which by Law requires the further approval of such stockholders
without such further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all of the
parties.   7.6 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
any party hereto, by action taken by its Board of Directors, may, to the

contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (iii)

instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.   ARTICLE 8  GENERAL

the representations and warranties in this Agreement, or in any
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, shall survive after the
