 (b) _Parent Owned Stock_. Each Share that is owned by Parent, Sub, Missouri or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Shares_. Subject to _Section 3.1(d)_, each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and be converted into the right to receive in cash, without interest, the Per Share Merger Consideration. As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall be cancelled in accordance with this _Section 3.1(c)_, and when so cancelled, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and (x) each holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for each such Share, without interest and (y) each holder of shares of Company Common Stock not represented by a Certificate (each an " _Uncertificated Share_ ") shall thereafter only have the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for each such Uncertificated Share, without interest. 

   

 (d) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_.

 Section 3.2 _Paying Agent; Exchange Procedures_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the consummation of the Asset Sales, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company, that shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to act as paying agent with respect to the Per Share Merger Consideration and the Special Dividend (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or before the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause Sub to deposit, with the Paying Agent a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the product of (x) the Per Share Merger Consideration and (y) the number of Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (exclusive of any Dissenting Shares and Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_). At or following the consummation of the Asset Sales, the Company shall deposit, or cause the escrow agent under the Parent Asset Purchase Agreement and the Arizona Asset Purchase Agreement to deposit, with the Paying Agent the Special Dividend Amount. The amounts deposited pursuant to the prior two sentences shall be referred to collectively as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". Funds made available to the Paying Agent shall be invested (if at all) by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that such investments shall only be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States (it being understood that any and all interest or income earned on funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under _Section 3.1(c)_ shall be promptly returned to the Surviving Entity). 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within four (4) Business Days thereof), the Surviving Entity or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Shares (other than holders of Dissenting Shares and Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent or, in the case of Uncertificated Shares, at or promptly following the receipt by the Paying Agent of a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 3.2(g)_) equal to (x) the number of Shares held by such stockholder multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and any Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon the surrender of any Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or in exchange for Uncertificated Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) is registered, if such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of 

    ##### 

  

    

such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent that such Tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Until exchanged or surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 3.2_, Uncertificated Shares and Shares
represented by Certificates (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance
with  _Section 3.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
exchange or surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which the
Shares theretofore represented shall have been converted pursuant to 
_Section 3.1_. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. All Per Share Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or in exchange for Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. At the Effective Time, (i) holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, (ii) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and (iii) there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Entity of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Shares for nine months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Entity, upon demand, and any holders of Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ and the instructions set forth in the letter of transmittal mailed to such holders after the Effective Time shall, after such funds have been delivered to the Surviving Entity, look only to the Surviving Entity (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 3.2(g)_) due upon surrender of their Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 3.2(f)_) or exchange of their Uncertificated Shares, without any interest thereon. 

   

 (e) _No Liability_. None of the Buyer Parties, the Company or the Paying Agent or any of their respective officers, employees, stockholders, directors, agents or Affiliates shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Per Share Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by the Surviving Entity as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 3.2(g)_) equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration. 

   

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Entity and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this 

    ##### 

  

    

Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as the Surviving Entity or the
Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Entity
or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by
the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable
Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Entity or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be. The parties acknowledge that this _Section 3.2(g)_
is not intended to, and shall not, amend the terms of any Deferred Share
Award or employment agreement related thereto.

 Section 4.9 _Compliance with Laws_. The businesses and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries are not and, since December 31, 2005, have not been, conducted or held in violation of any Law of any Governmental Entity, except for any violations that have not had a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has in effect all federal, state, local and provincial governmental licenses, authorizations, consents, permits and approvals (collectively, " _Permits_ ") necessary for it to own, lease or operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted, and no violation or default has occurred under any such Permit, except for the absence of Permits and for violations or defaults under Permits that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. 

  

 Section 4.10 _Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has timely filed or caused to be filed (after taking into account all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns required to be filed by them, except where the failure to timely file would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects. 

   

 (b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has paid or caused to be paid all material Taxes required to be paid (whether or not shown on any Tax return). 

   

 (c) The Company and the Company Subsidiary REIT (i) for all taxable years commencing in the year in which the Company or the Company Subsidiary REIT, as applicable, first made an election to be subject to taxation as a real estate investment trust within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code (a " _REIT_ "), through the most recent December 31, has   ##### 

  

  

  

qualified and been subject to taxation as a REIT and (ii) has operated, and
intends to continue to operate until the Effective Time, in such a manner as
would permit it to continue to qualify as a REIT, from the most recent
December 31 and through the Effective Time, without, however, taking into
account the effect on the Company or the Company Subsidiary REIT,
as applicable, of any of the Transactions required to be entered into, or
distributions required to be made, by the Company or the Company Subsidiary
REIT under this Agreement, and without any express or implied representation
being made that the Company or the Company Subsidiary REIT will
have satisfied as of the Effective Time any requirement to make dividend
distributions as a REIT with respect to 2007 that would have existed if the
Companys and the Company Subsidiary REITs 2007 taxable years were to have
closed at the Effective Time. The Company has no Subsidiary classified as a
REIT for federal income tax purposes other than the Company Subsidiary REIT.
To the Companys Knowledge, no challenge to the Companys or the Company
Subsidiary REITs status as a REIT is pending or threatened in writing. Each
Subsidiary of the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company Subsidiary REIT
that is a partnership, joint venture, or limited liability company and
that has not elected for federal income tax purposes to be a corporation or a
"taxable REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code is
treated for federal income tax purposes as a partnership or disregarded
entity, as the case may be, and not as a corporation or an
association taxable as a corporation. Each Subsidiary of the Company or the
Company Subsidiary REIT that is a corporation for federal income tax purposes
is a "qualified REIT subsidiary" pursuant to Section 856(i) of the Code, a
"taxable REIT subsidiary" pursuant to Section 856(l) of the Code or
a corporation which qualifies under the transitional rules set forth in
Section 546(b) of the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999. Neither the Company,
the Company Subsidiary REIT nor any of their Subsidiaries holds any assets
the disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to Section 1374 of
the Code as a result of (A) an election under IRS Notice 88-19 or Treasury
Regulations Section 1.337(d)-5 or Section 1.337(d)-6 or (B) the application
of Treasury Regulations Section 1.337(d)-7. 

   

 (d) No written requests for waivers of the time to assess any material Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries are pending. 

   

 (e) There are no material pending or threatened audits, examinations, investigations or other proceedings in respect of Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been notified in writing. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no pending or threatening audits, examinations, investigations or other proceedings in respect of Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (f) All Taxes which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are required by Law to withhold or to collect for payment have been withheld and collected except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. 

   

 (g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement, arrangement, understanding or plan that has resulted, or would result in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any change in control, in the payment of any amount that would, by operation of Section 280G of the Code, not be deductible by the entity making such payment. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (h) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has made or is obligated to make any payment that would not be deductible pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code. 

   

 (i) There are no Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (j) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any Tax Sharing Agreement or Tax Protection Agreement, other than any agreement or arrangement solely between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, pursuant to which it will have any obligation to make any payments after the Closing. For purposes of this _Section 4.10(j)_, a " _Tax Sharing Agreement_ " means any written agreement for the allocation or payment of Tax liabilities or payment for Tax benefits with respect to a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return which Tax Return includes or included the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. For purposes of this _Section 4.10(j)_, a " _Tax Protection Agreement_ " means any written agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party pursuant to which, in connection with the deferral of income Taxes of a third party partner in any Subsidiary of the Company that is classified as a partnership for federal income Tax purposes, the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has agreed to (i) maintain a minimum level of debt or provide rights to guarantee debt, (ii) retain or not dispose of assets for a period of time that has not since expired, (iii) make or refrain from making Tax elections, and/or (iv) only dispose of assets in a particular manner. 

   

 (k) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary (other than a "taxable REIT subsidiary" or a subsidiary of a "taxable REIT subsidiary") has engaged at any time in any "prohibited transactions" within the meaning of Section 857(b)(6) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any transaction that would give rise to "redetermined rents," "redetermined deductions" or "excess interest" described in Section 857(b)(7) of the Code. 

   

 (l) To the Knowledge of the Company, no claim has been made in writing by a taxing authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that the Company or any such Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. 

   

 (m) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has requested a private letter ruling from the IRS or comparable rulings from other taxing authorities. 

   

 (n) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any "listed transaction" described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b). 

   

 (o) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law). 

   

 (p) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has recognized taxable gain or loss from the disposition of any property transferred or received in an exchange that was reported as a "like kind exchange" under Section 1031 of the Code. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (q) As of the date hereof, neither the Company nor the Company Subsidiary REIT has any earnings and profits attributable to any non-REIT year of the Company or the Company Subsidiary REIT, as applicable, or any other corporation within the meaning of Section 857 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. 

   

 (r) The dividends paid deduction of the Company and the Company Subsidiary REIT for each taxable year of each such entity ending with the taxable year ended December 31, 2006, will equal or exceed the sum of (i) the amount determined under Code Section 857(a)(1) with respect to the Company or the Company Subsidiary REIT, as applicable, but computed with the modifications described in the next sentence, and (ii) the net capital gain of the Company or the Company Subsidiary REIT, as applicable, for such taxable year; _provided_ , _however_ , that such dividends paid deduction of the Company for the taxable year ended December 31, 2006 takes into account any Section 858 dividend made by the Company prior to the Closing Date. The amount described under _clause (i)_ above shall be computed by substituting "100%" for "90%" in each place it appears in Code Section 857(a)(1). 

   

 (s) The Special Dividend Amount will equal or exceed the sum of (i) the amount determined under Code Section 857(a)(1) with respect to the Companys current taxable year, computed with the modifications described in the next sentence and, and (ii) the net capital gain of the Company for such taxable year, assuming for purposes of _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ that the current taxable year of the Company will end on the date of the Closing. The amount described under  _clause (i)_ above shall be computed by substituting "100%" for "90%" in each place it appears in Code Section 857(a)(1). 

   

 (t) The net proceeds received by the Company Subsidiary REIT from the Asset Sales will equal or exceed the sum of (i) the amount determined under Code Section 857(a)(1) with respect to the Company Subsidiary REITs current taxable year, computed with the modifications described in the next sentence and, and (ii) the net capital gain of the Company Subsidiary REIT for such taxable year, assuming for purposes of _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ that the current taxable year of the Company will end on the date of the Closing. The amount described under _clause (i)_  above shall be computed by substituting "100%" for "90%" in each place it appears in Code Section 857(a)(1). 

   

 (u) As of the Effective Time, the net operating loss for federal income tax purposes carried over to the Company in its acquisition of KSL Recreation Corp. in April 2004 that remained unused, based on the Companys information and belief, was not less than $125 million, with the use of such net operating losses in 2007 and thereafter being subject to the limitations of Section 382 of the Code. 

   

 Section 4.11 _Benefit Plans_. (a) With respect to each Benefit Plan, the Company has made available to the Buyer Parties a true and correct copy of (i) each such Benefit Plan that has been reduced to writing and all amendments thereto and a summary of any unwritten Benefit Plan; (ii) each trust, insurance or administrative agreement or insurance policy or other funding medium relating to each such Benefit Plan; (iii) the most recent written explanation of each Benefit Plan provided to participants, and, if applicable, the most recent summary plan description provided to participants; (iv) if applicable, the three most recent annual reports (Form 5500) filed with the IRS, including all schedules and accountants opinions; (v) the most recent 

   ##### 

  

    

determination letter and/or application thereof, if any, issued by the IRS
with respect to any Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code, and (vi) all correspondence to and from any state or
federal agency within the last six years with respect to any Benefit

any of its Subsidiaries has adopted or amended in any material respect any
Benefit Plan since September 30, 2006 and copies of any such amendments or
Benefit Plans have been provided to Parent. 

  

 (b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, (i) each Benefit Plan has been maintained in compliance with its terms and, both as to form and in operation, with the requirements of applicable Law and (ii) all employer or employee contributions, premiums and expenses to or in respect of each Benefit Plan have been paid in full or, to the extent not yet due, have been adequately accrued on the applicable financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents in accordance with GAAP.

There is no Person (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) that together with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would be treated as a single employer under Section 414 of the Code or Section 4001(b) of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has at any time during the six-year period preceding the date hereof maintained, contributed to or incurred any liability under any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or any ERISA Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. 

   

 (c) As of the date of this Agreement there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened disputes, arbitrations, claims, suits, grievances, governmental proceedings or, to the Knowledge of the Company, investigations involving a Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits payable under any such Benefit Plan) that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. 

   

 (d) All Benefit Plans that are intended by their terms to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code have been determined by the IRS to be so qualified, or a timely application for such determination is now pending and, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, the Company has no Knowledge of any reason why any such Benefit Plan is not so qualified in operation. Except as set forth on Item 4.11 of the Company Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability or obligation under any welfare plan or agreement to provide benefits after termination of employment or service to any employee, director, consultant or dependent other than as required by Section 4980B of the Code. Each Benefit Plan may be amended, terminated, or otherwise modified by the Company to the greatest extent permitted by applicable Law, including the elimination of any and all future benefit accruals and no employee communications or provision of any relevant document has failed to effectively reserve the right of the Company to so amend, terminate or otherwise modify such Benefit Plan. 

   

 (e) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will or may (either alone or in connection with the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) (i) result in the   #####

Arizona has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of executed commitment letters (the " _Arizona Commitment Letters_ ") from Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC to provide debt financing in an aggregate amount set forth therein (being collectively referred to as the " _Arizona Debt Financing_ "). The Arizona Commitment Letters have not been amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement, no such amendment or modification is contemplated, and the respective commitments contained in such letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Arizona has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Arizona Commitment Letters that are payable on or prior to the date hereof, and the Arizona Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and are the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Arizona and, to the Knowledge of Arizona, the other parties thereto. There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount 

   ##### 

  

    

of the Arizona Debt Financing, other than as set forth in or expressly
contemplated by the Arizona Commitment Letters. The aggregate proceeds
contemplated by the Arizona Commitment Letters, together with the amounts
funded by the equity owner of Arizona, will be sufficient for Arizona to pay
the purchase price for the Arizona Asset Sale and any other repayment or
refinancing of debt contemplated in the Arizona Commitment Letters or the
Arizona Debt Financing and to pay all related fees and expenses. As of the
date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default on the part of Arizona under the
Arizona Commitment Letters and, as of the date of this Agreement, Arizona
does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Arizona
Debt Financing will not be satisfied or that the Arizona Debt Financing will
not be available to Arizona at the time of consummation of the Arizona Asset
Sale. 

  

 Section 6.7 _Brokers_. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person, other than Wachovia Capital Markets LLC and Eastdil Secured, L.L.C., the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Arizona, is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Arizona.

 Section 7.2 _Acquisition Proposals_. 

  

 (a) _No Solicitation_. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall any of them authorize or permit any officer, director, employee, or agent or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative (collectively, the " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly: 

    

 (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiries regarding, or the making, submission or reaffirmation of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or that reasonably may be expected to lead to the submission of, any Acquisition Proposal; 

   

 (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any non-public information or provide access to its books, records or personnel to, any Person in respect of, or otherwise cooperate with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal; or 

   

 (iii) exempt any Person (other than the Buyer Parties) from the restrictions on business combinations contained in Subtitle 6 of Title 3 of the MGCL or from the similar restrictions contained in the Company Charter. 

   

 Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall be responsible for any failure on the part of its Representatives to comply with this _Section 7.2_. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.2_, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, furnishing any information to, or entering into or participating in discussions or negotiations with, any Person that makes an unsolicited _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal in writing that did not otherwise result from a breach of this _Section 7.2_, if (i) the Board determines in good faith after consulting with the Companys legal counsel and financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, (ii) prior to furnishing such non-public information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such Person, the Company notifies Parent that it is furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such Person and (iii) prior to furnishing such non-public information to such Person, the Company (A) provides Parent with the information to be provided to such Person which Parent has not previously been provided, and (B) receives from such Person an executed confidentiality and standstill agreement no less favorable in any material respect to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement; it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making, or amendment, of an Acquisition Proposal. The Company will not release any Person from any standstill agreement or similar obligation to the Company or any Subsidiary other than the automatic termination of standstill obligations pursuant to the terms of agreements as in effect as of the date hereof, by virtue of the execution and announcement of this Agreement or otherwise; _provided_ , that if the Company   ##### 

  

  

  

receives an Acquisition Proposal from a Person within 30 days from the date of
this Agreement, the Company may release such Person from such agreement or
obligation but only if the Board determines in good faith after consultation
with outside legal counsel that failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Board has not made a
determination within 15 days of the release that such Acquisition Proposal is
a Superior Proposal, then the waiver of such standstill agreement will be
void and of no force or effect. 

   

 (c) The Company shall provide prompt (but in no event more than twenty-four (24) hours following receipt thereof) oral and written notice to Parent of (i) the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any material modification or amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, by the Company, any Subsidiary or any Representative, (ii) a copy of any documents or agreements provided in contemplation of such Acquisition Proposal (including any amendments, supplements or modifications thereto), (iii) the identity of such Person making any such Acquisition Proposal and (iv) the Companys intention, if any, to furnish information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such Person. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed in all material respects of the status and details (including any change to the material terms and conditions thereof) of any such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause each of the Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing such information to the Buyer Parties. 

   

 (d) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) an " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (A) any proposal or offer with respect to a merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction other than the Marketed Portfolio Sale or (B) any other direct or indirect acquisition, in the case of _clause (A)_ or _(B)_ , involving 30% or more of the total voting power or of any class of equity securities of the Company, or 30% or more of the consolidated total assets (including, equity securities of its Subsidiaries but excluding the assets associated with the Marketed Portfolio Sale) of the Company, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) a " _Superior Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal, (with all percentages in the definition of Acquisition Proposal increased to 50%) that is on terms that the Board determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with the Companys independent financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel), and after taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and such other factors as the Board considers to be appropriate (including, without limitation, financing terms, any termination fee or expense reimbursement payable under this Agreement, any conditions to the consummation thereof, the likelihood of the Acquisition Proposal being consummated and the likely timing of consummating the Acquisition Proposal), are more favorable to the Company and its stockholders than the Transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (e) Except as set forth in this _Section 7.2(e)_, the Board shall not (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to either of the Buyer Parties, the Board Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 7.2(b)_). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder   ##### 

  

  

  

Approval, (x) if the Board determines in good faith that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law, then the Board
may withdraw, or modify or change in a manner adverse to the Buyer Parties,
the Board Recommendation (" _Change in Recommendation_ ") and (y) in the case
of any Change in Recommendation being made in response to an unsolicited
_bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal (which did not otherwise result from
a breach of _Section 7.2_) that the Board has determined in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys independent financial advisor, is a
Superior Proposal, the Board may approve and recommend such Superior Proposal
and exempt the Person submitting such Superior Proposal from the restrictions
contained in any state takeover or similar laws concurrently with terminating
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(e)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such actions may only be taken at a time that is after (I) the third (3rd)
Business Day following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company
that the Board is prepared to take such action, and (II) at the end of such
period, the Board determines in good faith, after taking into account
all amendments or revisions committed to by the Buyer Parties and after
consultation with the Companys independent financial advisors, that such
Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Proposal relative to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as supplemented by any Counterproposal
(defined below). Any such written notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of such applicable Acquisition Proposal, include the most current
version of any agreement relating to such Acquisition Proposal (including any
amendments, supplements or modifications thereto), identify the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal and state that the Board otherwise intends to make a
Change in Recommendation (subject to compliance with this _subsection (e))_.
During any such three (3) Business Day period, the Buyer Parties shall be
entitled to deliver to the Company a counterproposal to such Acquisition
Proposal (a " _Counterproposal_ ") and Parent and the Company shall negotiate
in good faith in respect of any such Counterproposal. For the avoidance
of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any amendment to the
financial terms or any other material amendment to any material term of an
Acquisition Proposal which amendment affects the determination of whether the
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal to any Counterproposal shall be
treated as a new Acquisition Proposal for the purposes of this _Section
7.2(e)_ thereby requiring a new written notice by the Company and a new three
(3) Business Day period. 

   

 (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Board from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders) or from making any legally required disclosure to its stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that any action covered by _Section 7.2(e)_ may only be made in compliance with _Section 7.2(e)_. Further, any "stop-look-and-listen" communication by the Company or the Board to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the stockholders of the Company) shall not be considered a Change in Recommendation if it is made within ten (10) Business Days of receiving an Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (g) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to an Acquisition Proposal by or on behalf of the Company or any of the Representatives and shall inform each of the Representatives of its obligations under this _Section 7.2_ and instruct each of them to act in a   ##### 

  

  

  

manner consistent with such obligations; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company may comply with the next sentence. To the extent not previously
requested, the Company shall promptly request each Person with whom it has
executed a confidentiality agreement within the twelve (12) months prior to
the date hereof in connection with its consideration of any
Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all confidential or other non-
public information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the
Company or any of the Representatives. 

   

 Section 7.3 _Actions by Parent and Conduct of Business of Sub Pending the Merger_. Parent shall not knowingly take or permit any of its Subsidiaries to take any action that is reasonably likely to prevent or delay the consummation of the Merger. During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, Sub shall not engage in any activity of any nature except as provided in or contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE VIII 
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

   

 Section 8.1 _Employee Benefits_. (a) For a period of not less than one (1) year after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide all individuals who are employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time and remain an employee of the Surviving Entity or its successors or assigns or any of their Subsidiaries (including employees who are not actively at work on account of illness, disability or leave of absence) (the " _Retained Employees_ "), while employed by the Surviving Entity or its successors or assigns or any of their Subsidiaries, with base salary and bonus opportunity and benefits (other than those that pertain to equity-based compensation, equity-based benefits and nonqualified deferred compensation programs) that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the base salary and bonus opportunity and benefits provided to such Retained Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity may terminate Retained Employees for any lawful reason and nothing contained in this _Section 8.1_ shall be deemed to grant any employee any right to continued employment after the Effective Time, ensure a continued amount of commission-based compensation or interfere with the Surviving Entitys right or obligation to make such changes as are necessary to conform to applicable Law. Parent shall take all necessary action so that each Retained Employee shall after the Effective Time continue to be credited with the unused vacation and sick leave credited to such employee through the Effective Time under the applicable vacation and sick leave policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and Parent shall permit or cause the Company, the Surviving Entity and their Subsidiaries to permit such employees to use such vacation and sick leave in accordance with such policies. Parent shall take all necessary action so that, for all purposes (except for benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan) under each employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which Retained Employees become eligible to participate as of or after the Effective Time, each such Person shall be given credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 8.1_ or in _Section 8.2_, nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting the power of the Surviving Entity to amend or terminate any particular Benefit Plan or any other particular employee benefit plan, program, agreement or policy pursuant to its terms or as requiring the Surviving Entity to continue (other   ##### 

  

  

  

than as required by its terms) any written employment contract; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that no such termination or amendment may impair the rights of any
Person with respect to benefits or any other payments already accrued as of
the time of such termination or amendment without the consent of such
Person. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding _Sections 8.1(a)_ and _(b)_ , Parent shall honor or cause to be honored by the Company, the Surviving Entity and their Subsidiaries all employment agreements, bonus agreements, severance agreements, severance plans and non-competition agreements with the Persons who are, immediately prior to the Effective Time, directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (it being understood that nothing herein shall be deemed to mean that the Company, the Surviving Entity and their Subsidiaries shall not be required to honor any of their obligations under any such agreement). 

   

 (d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Company and the Surviving Entity to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Retained Employees and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any welfare or fringe benefit plan in which such employees and former employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting periods that are in effect with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied under the corresponding welfare or fringe benefit plan maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries for the Retained Employees and former employees prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide each Retained Employee and former employee with credit under any welfare plans in which such employee or former employee becomes eligible to participate after the Effective Time for any co-payments and deductibles paid by such Retained Employee or former employee for the then current plan year under the corresponding welfare plans maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 Section 8.2 _Deferred Share Awards_. The Company shall take all necessary action to ensure that, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided in Item 8.2 of the Company Letter, each Deferred Share Award then outstanding, whether or not then fully vested, shall be cancelled by the Company in consideration for which the holder thereof shall thereupon be entitled to receive, at the Effective Time, a cash payment in respect of such cancellation from the Company in an amount equal to (i) the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock remaining subject to issuance pursuant to such Deferred Share Award and (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, plus (ii) the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock remaining subject to issuance pursuant to such Deferred Share Award and (B) the amount of the Special Dividend issued with respect to each Share, minus (iii) all applicable federal, State and local Taxes required to be withheld by the Company (the aggregate amount of all such cash payments the " _Aggregate Award Amount_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause Sub to deposit, with the Company (or, at the Companys request, the Paying Agent) a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the Aggregate Award Amount. 

  

 Section 8.3 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholder Approval_. (a) The Company shall promptly prepare (in consultation with Parent) and file with the SEC, as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Proxy Statement in preliminary form. The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable (in consultation with Parent) 

   ##### 

  

 

to any comments of the SEC or its staff, and, to the extent permitted by Law,
to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys
stockholders as promptly as practicable after responding to all such comments
to the satisfaction of the SEC or its staff. The Company shall, in accordance
with _Section 8.12_, notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and will supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between
the Company or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If at any time prior to the
Stockholders Meeting there shall occur any event that the Company reasonably
determines should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare (in consultation with
Parent) and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement, in each
case to the extent required by applicable Law. The Buyer Parties agree that
they shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary stated above, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or
filing any other required filings (or, in each case, any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC or its staff
with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent with an opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response and the Company shall include
in such document or response all comments from Parent reasonably acceptable
to the Company, and to the extent practicable, the Company will provide
Parent with the opportunity to participate in any substantive calls between
the Company or any of its Representatives and the SEC concerning the Proxy
Statement. All of the parties hereto shall cause the Proxy Statement to comply
as to form and substance as to such party in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. The Company and the Buyer
Parties agree to include in the Proxy Statement the disclosure set forth on
Item 8.3 of the Company Letter. 

   

 (b) The Company shall, promptly (for the avoidance of doubt a forty-five day solicitation period shall be deemed a prompt period of time) after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the Companys stockholders, in accordance with the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Stockholders  Meeting_") for the purpose of obtaining the approval of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, by holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ ").

Regulation S-X shall be deemed reasonable), and during such period, the
Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly
to the Buyer Parties all information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as may reasonably be requested by the Buyer Parties; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that such Access and information shall only be provided to the
extent that such Access or the provision of such information would not
violate applicable Law or any applicable contractual provisions; _provided_
_,_ _further_ _,_ that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to
permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the
reasonable judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any
trade secrets of third Persons or violate any of its obligations with respect
to confidentiality if the Company shall have used reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent of such third Person to such inspection or disclosure
and such consent was not obtained, (ii) to permit any invasive physical
testing, except as agreed to in writing by the Company, which consent shall

for any reason, the Buyer Parties shall promptly return or destroy, or cause

of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide Access or to disclose
information where such Access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client or work product privileges of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. All information provided pursuant to this _Section 8.4_ shall be
governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 (ii) if the Company or Parent terminates this Agreement under  _Section 10.1(b)(iii)_ or _10.1(c)_ and prior to such termination or, in the case of a termination under _Section 10.1(b)(iii)_ , prior to the Stockholders Meeting, any Person or "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (x) shall have made an Acquisition Proposal to the Company or the stockholders of the Company which shall be publicly announced or (y) shall have publicly announced an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal and, in each case, such Acquisition Proposal shall not have been withdrawn prior to such termination or, in the case of a termination under _Section 10.1(b)(iii)_, prior to the Stockholders Meeting, then, if, within nine (9) months after such termination, the Company shall enter into a definitive agreement providing for an Acquisition Proposal (with all percentages in the definition of Acquisition Proposal increased to 50%) or an Acquisition Proposal (with all percentages in the definition of Acquisition Proposal increased to 50%) shall be consummated, the Company shall pay the Termination Fee concurrently with the earlier of the entering into of such definitive agreement or the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 10.1(f)_, the Buyer Parties shall pay to the Company within three (3) Business Days after the date of termination (i) all reasonable costs and expenses, including the reasonable fees and expenses of lawyers, accountants, consultants, financial advisors and investment bankers, and expenses contemplated by the last sentence of _Section 8.5(a)_, incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the entering into of this Agreement and the carrying out of any and all acts contemplated hereunder up to an aggregate amount of $15,000,000 (the " _Company Expenses_ "). If this agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)(iii)_, _10.1(c)_  or _10.1(d)_ or by the Company pursuant to _Section 10.1(e)_, the Company shall pay to Parent, within three (3) Business days after the date of termination, all reasonable costs and expenses, including the reasonable fees and expenses of lawyers, accountants, consultants, financial advisors, and investment bankers, and expenses contemplated by the last sentence of  _Section 8.5(a)_, incurred by the Buyer Parties in connection with the entering into of this Agreement and the carrying out of any and all acts contemplated hereunder up to an aggregate amount of $15,000,000 (the " _Parent Expenses_ "). Except as set forth in _Section 8.5(g)_, the payment of expenses set forth in this _Section 8.5(c)_ is not an exclusive remedy, but is in addition to any other rights or remedies available to the parties hereto (whether at Law or in equity), and in no respect is intended by the parties hereto to constitute liquidated damages, or be viewed as an indicator of the damages 

  ##### 

  

  

  

payable, or in any other respect limit or restrict damages available in case
of any breach of this Agreement. 

   

 (d) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this  _Section 8.5(d)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee or Parent Expenses when due or Parent shall fail to pay the Company Expenses when due, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall reimburse the other party for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by such other party (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement of this _Section 8.5(d)_. 

   

 (e) In the event that the Buyer Parties are obligated to pay the Company Expenses set forth in  _Section 8.5(c)_, Parent shall pay to the Company from an amount deposited into escrow (collectively, the " _Escrowed Amount_ ") in accordance with the next sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Escrowed Amount and (ii) the sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Company without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) or 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), as determined by the Companys independent certified public accountants, plus (2) in the event the Company receives either (A) a letter from the Companys counsel indicating that the Company has received a ruling from the IRS described in _Section 8.5(f)_ or (B) an opinion from the Companys outside counsel as described in _Section 8.5(f)_, an amount equal to the Escrowed Amount less the amount payable under _clause (1)_ above. To secure the Buyer Parties obligation to pay these amounts, the Buyer Parties shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Company Expenses with an escrow agent selected by Parent and on such terms (subject to _Section 8.5(f)_) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company, Parent and the escrow agent. The excess of the amount placed in escrow over the amount(s) described in _clause (a)_ and/or _(b)_ above, as applicable, shall be retained in escrow and released from time to time over the five year period beginning on the date Company Expenses are deposited into escrow, subject, in each case, to the Companys satisfaction of the conditions set forth above. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Escrowed Amount pursuant to _Section 8.5(f)_ shall be made at the time the Parent is obligated to pay the Company such amount pursuant to _Section 8.5(f)_ by wire transfer or bank check. 

   

 (f) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Escrowed Amount in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to the Company unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from the Companys independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Company without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from the Companys accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to the Company, or (ii) a letter from the Companys counsel indicating that the Company received a ruling from the IRS holding that the Escrowed Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or alternatively, the Companys outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Company of the Escrowed Amount would constitute Qualifying Income, would be excluded   ##### 

  

    

from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code
or would not otherwise disqualify the Company as a REIT), in which case the
escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Escrowed Amount to the
Company. The Buyer Parties agree to amend this _Section 8.5(f)_ at the
request of the Company in order to (x) maximize the portion of the
Escrowed Amount that may be distributed to the Company hereunder without
causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code, (y) improve the Companys chances of securing a
favorable ruling described in this _Section 8.5(f)_ or (z) assist the Company
in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as described
in this _Section 8.5(f)_. The escrow agreement shall also provide that any
portion of the Company Expenses held in escrow for five years shall be
released by the escrow agent to Parent. 

   

 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but subject to _Sections 10.2_ and _11.8_ , the parties hereby acknowledge that, if the Company is obligated to pay the Parent Expenses and Termination Fee pursuant to _Sections 8.5(b)_ and _8.5(c)_ , the right of the Buyer Parties to receive such payments shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer Parties for damages against the Company and any of its Subsidiaries and the Companys and its Subsidiaries respective directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives for the failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated, and upon payment of such amounts in accordance with _Sections 8.5(b)_ and  _8.5(c)_ , none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives shall have any liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 Section 8.6 _Public Announcements_. The Buyer Parties and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by applicable Law or fiduciary duties and shall provide the other parties with an opportunity to review and comment on any such press release or statement to the extent practicable. 

  

 Section 8.7 _Transfer Taxes_. The Company and the Buyer Parties shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer, recordation, or gains, sales, use, license, excise, custom or duty, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, and transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes that become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together with any related interest, penalties or additions to Tax, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes. All Transfer Taxes shall be paid by the Buyer Parties and expressly shall not be a liability of any holder of Shares.

   ##### 

  

 

as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on
the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 Section 8.9 _Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance_. (a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time (unless otherwise required by applicable Law), the charter and bylaws of the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to the exculpation of, indemnification of and advancement of expenses to directors, officers, employees and agents than those set forth in the Company Charter or Company Bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) of the Company (or the relevant Subsidiary) as in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any claim or claims are asserted against any individual entitled to the protections of such provisions within such six-year period, such provisions shall not be modified until the final disposition of any such claims. Parent and the Surviving Entity shall, jointly and severally, exculpate, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent provided in the Company Charter or Company Bylaws or the organizational documents of any Subsidiary, as applicable, any indemnification agreement or under any applicable Laws, in each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement (and Parent shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law), each present and former director and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, obligations, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (formal or informal), in and to the extent of their capacities as such and not as stockholders and/or optionholders of the Company or its Subsidiaries (including rights relating to advancement of expenses and indemnification rights to which such persons are entitled because they are serving as a director or officer of another entity at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that any determination required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Persons conduct complies with the standards set forth under the applicable Law, the Company Charter or Company Bylaws or the organizational documents of any Subsidiary, as applicable, or any such agreement, as the case may be, shall be made by independent legal counsel jointly selected by such Indemnified Person and Parent; _provided_ _,_ _further_ , that (i) nothing in this _Section 8.9_ shall impair any rights of any Indemnified Person and (ii) neither the Surviving Entity nor Parent shall be liable for any settlement effected without the prior written consent of the Surviving Entity (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, if any Indemnified Person becomes involved in any actual or threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding or investigation covered by this  _Section 8.9_ after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, promptly advance to such Indemnified Person his or her legal or other expenses (including the cost of any investigation and preparation incurred in connection therewith), subject to the providing by such Indemnified Person of an undertaking to reimburse all amounts so advanced in the event of a non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a "tail" insurance policy (which policy by its express terms shall survive the Merger), of at least the same coverage 

     ##### 

 

  

and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to
the directors and officers of the Company as the Companys and the
Subsidiaries existing policy or policies, for the benefit of the current and
former officers and directors of the Company and each Subsidiary with a
claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time with respect to
directors and officers liability for claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall the aggregate premium payable for such "tail"
insurance policies for its entire period exceed $4,500,000 (such amount being
the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If the Company is unable to obtain the "tail"
insurance described in the first sentence of this _Section 8.9(b)_ for an
amount equal to or less than the Maximum Premium, the Company shall be
entitled to obtain as much comparable "tail" insurance as possible for an
amount equal to the Maximum Premium. 

   

 (c) If Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or shall cease to continue to exist for any reason or (ii) shall transfer all or a majority (measured by value) of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 8.9_. In addition, the Surviving Entity shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the Surviving Entity unable to satisfy its obligations under this _Section 8.9_. 

   

 (d) The provisions of this _Section 8.9_ are intended to be for the express benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person (who are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 8.9_), his or her heirs and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Entity and shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Indemnified Persons (including their successors, assigns and heirs) without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person (including the successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby. The exculpation and indemnification provided for by this _Section_ shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Person is entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law, contract or otherwise.

the information relating to the Buyer Parties or the Company, as the case may
be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third Person and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions (including the Proxy
Statement). In exercising the foregoing rights, the Company and each of the
Buyer Parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

If any portion of the Parent Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Parent Preferred Equity Funding Letter or the Parent Commitment Letter, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on comparable or more favorable terms to Parent (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach or alleged material breach by any party to the Parent Preferred Equity Funding Letter or the Parent Commitment Letter of which Parent, Sub or Missouri becomes aware, or any termination of the Parent Preferred Equity Funding Letter or the Parent Commitment Letter.

 (c) Arizona shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Arizona Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Arizona Commitment Letter (provided that Arizona may replace or amend the Arizona Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities which had not executed the Arizona Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, or otherwise, so long as the terms would not reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of Arizona to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Arizona commitments, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Arizona to obtaining the Arizona Financing set forth therein, and (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Arizona Commitment Letter or on other terms that would not adversely impact the ability of Arizona to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of consummation of the transactions contemplated and (iv) consummate the Arizona Financing at or prior to the Final Condition Satisfaction Date.

the proceeds contemplated by the Arizona Commitment Letter and that any
failure by Arizona to have available all funds contemplated by the Arizona
Commitment Letter on the Final Condition Satisfaction Date shall constitute a
material breach by Arizona of this Agreement. 

   

 (e) The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause the Subsidiaries and its and their representatives to provide, all reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by each of the Buyer Parties (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and does not require the Company or any of its Representatives to execute and deliver any certificate or opinion to the extent any such certificate or opinion certifies or opines, as applicable, with respect to facts, circumstances or events that will exit after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby and the incurrence of any indebtedness of the Company pursuant to the Debt Financing); _provided_ , that none of the Company or any Subsidiary shall be required to pay any fees (including commitment or other similar fees) or incur any other liability in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time.

 Section 12.2 _Entry into Arizona Asset Purchase Agreement_.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Article XII_, Parent and Arizona each shall have the right to structure all or a portion of the Asset Sales as a purchase of ownership interests in Subsidiaries of the Company that own Company Properties that are the subject of the Asset Sales in order to minimize Transfer Taxes and other transaction costs or to insulate them from liabilities of the general partner of any Subsidiary, so long as such revised structure has no adverse impact on the Company or its stockholders and does not, and would not reasonably be expected to, delay the Closing. The Company shall reasonably cooperate in connection with any such restructuring of the Asset Sales. 

   ##### 

  

  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Sub, Missouri, Arizona and the Company have caused this Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized all as of the date first written above.
