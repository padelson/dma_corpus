designate a bank or trust company, that shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to act as
paying agent with respect to the Per Share Merger Consideration and the Special Dividend (the
&#147;<U>Paying Agent</U>&#148;). At or before the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause Sub to

(x)&nbsp;the Per Share Merger Consideration and (y)&nbsp;the number of Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (exclusive of any Dissenting Shares and Shares to be
cancelled pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;3.1(b)</U>). At or following the consummation of the Asset
Sales, the Company shall deposit, or cause the escrow agent under the Parent Asset Purchase
Agreement and the Arizona Asset Purchase Agreement to deposit, with the Paying Agent the Special
Dividend Amount. The amounts deposited pursuant to the prior two sentences shall be referred to

Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Shares (other than holders of Dissenting
Shares and Shares to be cancelled pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;3.1(b)</U>), (i)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably agree) and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Per Share Merger

transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent or, in the case of Uncertificated Shares, at or promptly following the receipt by the Paying
Agent of a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be required by the

provided in <U>Section&nbsp;3.2(g)</U>) equal to (x)&nbsp;the number of Shares held by such stockholder
multiplied by (y)&nbsp;the Per Share Merger Consideration, and any Certificates surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon the
surrender of any Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or in exchange for
Uncertificated Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) is registered, if such
Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
