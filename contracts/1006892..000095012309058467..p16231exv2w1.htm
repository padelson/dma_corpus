Merger, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent (i)&nbsp;a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to pay the aggregate Common Stock Share Consideration
pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.1(c), and (ii)&nbsp;cash in an amount sufficient (together with the Company Cash

specify) and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for the Merger Consideration. Exchange of Book-Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with
Parent&#146;s customary procedures with respect to certificates represented by book entry. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and such
other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent), or compliance with
Parent&#146;s customary procedures with respect to the exchange of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of the
shares of Company Common Stock or Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock represented thereby shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (i)&nbsp;the amount of cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section&nbsp;2.1(c) or 2.1(d), (ii)&nbsp;the shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in
non-certificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested) representing the
number of whole shares, if any, of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section&nbsp;2.1(c), (iii)&nbsp;cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2(i) and
(iv)&nbsp;any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2(j), and the shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Company Common Stock or Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company, the proper number of shares of Parent Company Stock and amount of cash may be issued
and paid, as applicable, in exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such
Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section&nbsp;2.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration in respect
thereof, cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2(i) and any dividends
or distributions payable pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2(j). No interest will be paid or will accrue on
the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.
