ARTICLE I. 

   

THE MERGER  

  

 Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). 

  

 Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. (Central Time) on a date to be specified by the parties, which date shall be no later than the second business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI 

   ##### 

  

 

(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the

unless another time or date, or both, are agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto. The date on which the Closing is held is herein referred to as the "
_Closing Date_ ". The Closing will be held at the offices of DLA Piper

 Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date the parties shall file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such later time as is agreed to by the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 (a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended to read in its entirety as set forth on _Exhibit C_. 

  

 (b) The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

  

 Section 1.6 _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. Parent and the Company shall take all necessary actions to cause the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time, until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 

  

 Section 1.7 _Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE II. 

   

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT 
 CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS 

   

 Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.00025 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ "), any shares of Series B 2.5% Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (" _Series B Preferred Stock_") or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub: 

  

 (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Any shares of Company Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and any shares of Company Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub (in each case, other than shares held on behalf of third parties), shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock owned by any Subsidiary of the Company shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. 

   

 (i) Subject to Section 2.1(c)(ii) and Section 2.1(c)(iii) below, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)), shall be converted into the right to receive: 

   

 (A) that fraction of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Parent Common Stock equal to 0.5797 (the " _Base Exchange Ratio_ "), which fraction of a share has a value equal to $12.00 based on the closing price per share of the Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market on the date hereof; and 

   

 (B) $6.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Base Common Stock Cash Consideration_ "). 

   

The combined value of the Base Common Stock Cash Consideration and such
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock at the Base Exchange Ratio (based
on the closing price per share of the Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock
Market on the date hereof) is equal to $18.00. 

   

 (ii) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(c)(i) above, if the Financing Election is duly made in accordance with Section 5.15, then the Base Exchange Ratio shall be decreased as provided in Section 5.15, and each share of Company Common Stock issued 

   ##### 

  

    

and outstanding as of the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)), shall instead be
converted into the right to receive: 

   

 (A) that fraction of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Parent Common Stock equal to 0.2562 (the " _Adjusted Exchange Ratio_ "), which fraction of a share has a value equal to $5.30 based on the closing price per share of the Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market on the date hereof; and 

   

 (B) $12.70 in cash, without interest (the " _Adjusted Common Stock Cash Consideration_ "). 

   

The parties acknowledge that, notwithstanding the foregoing adjustments, the
combined value of the Adjusted Common Stock Cash Consideration and a fraction
of a share of Parent Common Stock at the Adjusted Exchange Ratio (based on
the closing price per share of the Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock
Market on the date hereof) will be equal to $18.00. 

   

If the Financing Election is duly made in accordance with Section 5.15 below,
and thereafter, as a result of increases in the market price of the Parent
Common Stock or exercises of Company Options following such election, the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
pursuant to this Section 2.1(c)(ii), Section 2.3, and Section 2.4 (including
the additional shares, if any, of Parent Common Stock issuable in respect of
additional shares of Company Common Stock issued upon exercise of Company
Options and Company Warrants prior to the Effective Time), would exceed 19.9%
(as calculated under the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market) of Parents issued
and outstanding  shares of Parent Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time (19.9% of such issued and outstanding shares rounded down to
the nearest whole share, the " _Maximum Share Number_ "), then (1) the
Adjusted Exchange Ratio shall be further reduced (the amount of such
reduction, the " _Exchange Ratio Reduction Number_ ") to the minimum extent
necessary such that the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable in the Merger pursuant to this Section 2.1(c)(ii), Section 2.3, and
Section 2.4 (including the additional shares, if any, of Parent Common Stock
issuable in respect of additional shares of Company Common Stock issued upon
exercise of Company Options and Company Warrants prior to the Effective
Time), equals the Maximum Share Number, and (2) the Adjusted Common Stock
Cash Consideration shall be further increased by an amount in cash equal to
the Exchange Ratio Reduction Number multiplied by the Parent Common Stock
Market Price; provided, that in no event will the such cash adjustment exceed
$10,000,000 in the aggregate. 

   

 (iii) For purposes of this Agreement, (A) the Base Exchange Ratio and the Adjusted Exchange Ratio are, as applicable, referred to herein as the " _Exchange Ratio,_ " (B) the fraction of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio is referred to herein as the " _Common Stock Share Consideration_ "; (C) the Base Common Stock Cash Consideration and the Adjusted 

   ##### 

  

    

Common Stock Cash Consideration are, as applicable, referred to herein as the
" _Common Stock Cash Consideration,_ " and (D) the Common Stock Cash
Consideration, together with the Common Stock Share Consideration, are
together referred to herein as the " _Common Stock Merger Consideration._ " 

   

 (iv) As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (a " _Common Stock Certificate_ ") or non-certificated book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such  shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such securities, except the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration to be issued in consideration therefor, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or distributions to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock become entitled in accordance with this Article II upon surrender of such Common Stock Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2(b), without interest. 

  

 (d) _Conversion of Series B Preferred Stock_. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall be converted into the right to receive $1,100.00 plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon through the Effective Time, in cash, without interest (the " _Preferred Stock Merger Consideration,_ " and together with the Common Stock Merger Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, dividends shall cease to accrue on all such shares of Series B Preferred Stock, all such shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Series B Preferred Stock (each, a " _Series B Preferred Stock Certificate_" and, together with the Common Stock Certificates, the " _Certificates_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect to such securities, except the right to receive the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Series B Preferred Stock Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2(b), without interest. 

  

 Section 2.2 _Surrender of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company to act as agent for issuance of the Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") upon surrender of the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares. Prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger, the Company shall deposit with the Exchange Agent (by wire transfer of immediately available funds) cash in an amount that will be specified by Parent in writing at least twenty-four (24) hours before the filing of the Certificate of Merger, which amount shall not be more than the amount of the Companys Unrestricted Cash as provided in Section 6.2(e) below (such amount, the " _Company Cash Deposit_ " and the notice given by Parent with respect to the Company Cash Deposit, the " _Deposit Notice_ "); _provided_ , that, if the Closing does not occur on such intended Closing Date, the Exchange Agent will return, or cause to be returned, such Company Cash Deposit, and any interest or other income thereon, to the Company on the second business day after such deposit). The Company Cash Deposit shall be made solely out of cash on hand and shall be used solely for purposes of paying a portion of the Merger 

   ##### 

  

    

Consideration in accordance with this Article II and shall not be used to
satisfy any other obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Prior
to the filing of the Certificate of Merger, Parent shall deposit or cause to
be deposited with the Exchange Agent (i) a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock sufficient to pay the aggregate Common Stock Share
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c), and (ii) cash in an amount
sufficient (together with the Company Cash Deposit) to pay (A) the aggregate
Common Stock Cash Consideration and any Preferred Stock Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to Sections 2.1(c) and 2.1(d), and (B) the aggregate amount
of cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(i). Such
cash and shares of Parent Common Stock provided to the Exchange Agent,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, are
referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund._ " 

  

 (b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly (but in any event within five (5) business Days) after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Exchange of Book-Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with Parents customary procedures with respect to certificates represented by book entry. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent), or compliance with Parents customary procedures with respect to the exchange of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock represented thereby shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the amount of cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c) or 2.1(d), (ii) the shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested) representing the number of whole shares, if any, of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c), (iii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(i) and (iv) any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(j), and the shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the proper number of shares of Parent Company Stock and amount of cash may be issued and paid, as applicable, in exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration in respect thereof, cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(i) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(j). No interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. All Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(i) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(j) paid and/or issued upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. Subject to Section 2.2(e), if, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

  

 (d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay the Merger Consideration, together with any cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(i) and dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(j), to such Person in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate. 

   

 (e) _Termination of Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for 270 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to the Surviving Corporation upon demand. Any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid from the Exchange Fund or delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. After the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund in U.S. government or other investment grade securities, in each case, maturing in not more than one year, or other investments of comparable liquidity and credit-worthiness as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall be the property of, and shall be paid promptly to, Parent. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall promptly deposit into the Exchange Fund the additional cash required to fully satisfy such payment obligations. 

   

 (h) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 2.1, any shares of Company Common Stock or, in the event appraisal rights are available under the DGCL, Series B 

   ##### 

  

    

Preferred Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the
Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded
appraisal for such shares pursuant to, and has complied in all respects
with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise
loses its rights to appraisal or it is determined that such holder does
not have appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL. If, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses its right
to appraisal, or if it is determined that such holder does not have appraisal
rights, such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration,
together with any cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to
Section 2.2(i) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.2(j), without interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice
of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands except as required by applicable
Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, unless and to the extent required to do so under applicable
Law. 

  

 (i) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder otherwise entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder in respect of all shares of Company Common Stock owned by such holder at the Effective Time) will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.2(i), a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share of Parent Common Stock in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by the average closing price of the Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market for the five (5) trading day period ending three (3) days prior to the Effective Date (" _Parent Common Stock Market Price_ "). No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share. 

  

 (j) _Dividends and Distributions; Voting_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger and with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares until such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are properly surrendered. Following such surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. Holders of unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any stockholders meeting of Parent the number of whole shares of Parent 

   ##### 

  

    

Common Stock issuable hereunder in respect of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, regardless of whether such holders have exchanged their Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, and Parent agrees to treat holders of unsurrendered
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares as holders of record of Parent for purposes
of notice and voting. 

  

 Section 2.3 _Company Stock Plans_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Company Option, each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and terminated at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration with respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that would be issuable upon a net exercise of such Company Option assuming the market value of the Company Common Stock at the time of such exercise were equal to the value of the Common Stock Merger Consideration as of the close of trading on the trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of clarity, any Company Option with a per-share exercise price that is greater than or equal to the value of the Common Stock Merger Consideration as of the close of trading on the trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and terminated as of the Effective Time, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto or in respect thereof. Any Common Stock Merger Consideration payable in respect of Company Options pursuant to this Section 2.3(a) shall be paid as soon after the Closing Date as shall be practicable and in any event within fifteen (15) days thereafter. 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any RSU, each RSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested (except that with respect to any RSU which by the terms of the award agreement pursuant to which it was granted provides for a lesser percentage of such RSU to become vested upon the consummation of the Merger, such RSU shall only become vested as to such lesser percentage), and then shall be canceled and terminated at the Effective Time, and the holder of such vested RSU shall be entitled to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock into which the vested portion of the RSU would otherwise be convertible. The Common Stock Merger Consideration payable in respect of RSUs pursuant to this Section 2.3(b) shall be paid as soon after the Closing Date as shall be practicable and in any event within fifteen (15) days thereafter. 

  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to (i) make any amendments to the terms of, and give any notices required under, the Company Stock Plans and obtain all consents (including all consents necessary to provide that applicable RSUs and Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted at the Effective Time in the manner described above) that, in each case, are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.3, (ii) terminate all Company Stock Plans, such termination to be effective at or before the Effective Time, and (iii) ensure that the Company will not at the Effective Time be bound by any Options, stock appreciation rights, or other agreements which would entitle any Person, other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, to own any capital stock of the Surviving Corporation or to receive any payment in respect thereof (other than the payment of Common Stock Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.3(a)). 

   ##### 

  

  

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, payment may be withheld in respect of any Company Option or RSU until any necessary consents are obtained. 

  

 (d) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger to holders of Company Options or RSUs, but in lieu thereof each holder otherwise entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.3(a)(ii) or Section 2.3(b) (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder in respect of all Company Options or shares of Company Common Stock issued upon conversion of any vested RSU owned by such holder at the Effective Time) will be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share of Parent Common Stock in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by the Parent Common Stock Market Price. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share 

  

 (e) The Company shall take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ ") in accordance with that certain No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") regarding such matters. Parent shall take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause the receipt of Parent equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters 

  

 Section 2.4 _Treatment of Warrants_. 

  

 (a) Parent acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger will constitute a "Change of Control," as such term is defined in those certain outstanding warrants to purchase Company Common Stock issued under the Purchase Agreement dated as of November 21, 2005 (the " _Company Warrants_ "). Accordingly, at the Effective Time, each Company Warrant that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and, in accordance with Section 3 of such Warrants, shall be assumed by Parent and converted automatically into a warrant of Parent (a " _Converted Warrant_ ") pursuant to which each holder thereof will have the right to receive, upon exercise of such Converted Warrant at any time following the Effective Time but prior to the expiration date thereof, the Common Stock Merger Consideration which the holder thereof would have been entitled to receive upon the Effective Time had such Company Warrant been exercised for Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to each holder of a Converted Warrant an appropriate notice evidencing the foregoing assumption of the Company Warrant by Parent, and Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent 

   ##### 

  

    

Common Stock for delivery upon the exercise of the Converted Warrants,
including the authorization for listing of such shares on the applicable
national securities exchange. 

  

 Section 2.5 _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as shall be required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

 Section 2.6 _Adjustments_. If during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Parent Common Stock shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any similar transaction, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration, including the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change to afford the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule indicates each Company Plan that is maintained outside the jurisdiction of the United States, or covers any employee residing or working outside the United States (any such Company Plan, a " _Foreign Benefit Plan_ ," any Company Plan that is not a Foreign Benefit Plan being called a " _Domestic Benefit Plan_ "). 

  

 (b) True, current and complete copies of the following documents, with respect to each of the Company Plans, have been made available to Parent by the Company, to the extent applicable: (i) any plans, all amendments thereto and related trust documents, insurance contracts or other funding arrangements, and amendments thereto; (ii) for the most recent two years, Forms 5500 and all schedules thereto and the most recent actuarial report, if

No fiduciary has any material liability for breach of fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply in connection with the administration or investment of the assets of any Domestic Benefit Plan; _provided_ that this sentence is subject to the Knowledge of the Company to the extent that any Domestic Benefit Plan refers to a Plan fiduciary other than (i) the Company, (ii) any Subsidiary, or (iii) or any of their respective officers, employees and directors. 

  

 (d) Each Domestic Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Code is so qualified and (ii) any trusts intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501 of the Code are so exempt. Nothing has occurred with respect to the operation of such Domestic Benefit Plans that could cause the loss of such tax favored treatment, qualification or exemption, or the imposition of any material liability, penalty or Tax under ERISA, the Code or other applicable Law that, if corrected under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System, could reasonably be expected to give rise to a material liability. 

  

 (e) No plan currently or ever in the past maintained, sponsored, contributed to or required to be contributed to by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of Companys ERISA Affiliates is or ever in the past was (i) a "multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, (ii) a plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or (iii) a plan subject to Section 412 of the Code.

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any nonqualified deferred compensation plan subject to Section 409A of the Code that would subject any Person to tax pursuant to Section 409A of the Code based upon a good faith interpretation of all applicable regulations, notices and regulatory guidance. The exercise price of each Company Option is not less than the fair market value (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) of the underlying stock on the date the Company Option was granted. 

  

 (g) Except as would not reasonably be expected to give rise to a material liability, (i) all contributions (including all employer contributions and employee salary reduction

Benefit Plans subject to Section 412 of the Code.

 (i) There are no pending actions or lawsuits which have been asserted or instituted against the Company Plans, the assets of any of the trusts under such plans or the sponsor or administrator of any of the Company Plans, or against any fiduciary of the Company Plans (other than routine benefit claims), nor to the Knowledge of the Company, has any such action or lawsuit been threatened, nor does the Company have any Knowledge of facts that could form the basis for any such action or lawsuit. 

  

 (j) None of the Domestic Benefit Plans provide for post-employment life or health insurance, or other welfare benefits coverage for any participant or any beneficiary of a participant, except (i) as may be required under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (" _COBRA_ ") or other similar law, (ii) deferred compensation benefits accrued as liabilities on the Companys financial statements and (iii) at the expense of the participant or the participants beneficiary. 

  

 (k) Except as set forth in Sections 2.1 and 2.3 or under a Contract listed on Schedule 3.11(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions will (i) result in any payment becoming due to any Employee, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company Plan or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits under any such plan. 

  

 (l) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions will (either alone or in combination with another event that occurs at or prior to the Effective Time) result in the payment of any amount that would, individually or in combination with any other such payment, reasonably be expected to constitute an "excess parachute payment," as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code. 

  

 (m) None of the Employees is represented in his or her capacity as an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any labor organization or works council or similar representative.

regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of SOX, without qualification,
when next due.

Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Registration Statement and/or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, to cause the Registration Statement to become effective as promptly as practicable and to remain effective through the Effective Time and, following the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company and (subject to Section 5.15) to the stockholders of Parent, in each case as provided in Section 5.5(c).

 (b) All filings by the Company with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and all mailings to the Companys stockholders in connection

shall be subject to the prior review and comment by the Company. Each of
Parent and the Company shall (i) as promptly as practicable notify the other

is discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, which is required to be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
the Registration Statement or any financing materials contemplated by Section
5.15 or Section 5.16, so that such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading (including any assumptions underlying forward-
looking information), then the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties and prepare, disseminate and file,
as applicable, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information.

any confidentiality agreement entered into pursuant to this paragraph within

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to contrary set forth in this Section 5.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement, at all times during the period commencing as of the date hereof and continuing until the Companys receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval (but in no event after obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval) and provided the Company first enters into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) of the Company may, directly or indirectly through one or more Representatives, participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, furnish any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, and/or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to the personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to any Person (and/or such Persons Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, consultants, financing sources, agents, representatives and advisors) that has made or delivered to the Company a bona fide written Takeover Proposal after the date hereof that was not initiated, solicited, facilitated or encouraged in breach of Section 5.3(a) and may cause the Company to enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Person, _provided_ that the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) of the Company shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Takeover Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable Law.

inquiry or other contact (and shall include with such notice copies of any

 (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or cause or authorize the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger, acquisition, purchase or joint venture agreement or other agreement related to any Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with Section 5.3(b)) (each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ "). 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, prior
to the time that the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained (but in
no event after obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval) (x) the Board of
Directors of the Company (or committee thereof) may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change if the Board of Directors (or committee thereof)
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under the applicable
Law, and, with respect to any recommendation of a Takeover Proposal, the
Board (or committee thereof) determines in good faith that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (y) if the Company receives a
Takeover Proposal that was not initiated, solicited, facilitated or
encouraged in violation of this Agreement and that the Board of Directors
(or committee thereof) determines in good faith constitutes a Superior
Proposal, the Board of Directors (or committee thereof) may, in response to
such Superior Proposal after the expiration of the five business day period
described below, cause the Company to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal but only if the Company shall have
concurrently with entering into such definitive agreement terminated this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) and prior thereto or concurrently
therewith paid the Company Termination Fee required pursuant to Section 7.3,
but in any event only after the fifth business day following Parents receipt
of written notice (the " _Notice_ ") from the Company advising Parent that
the Board of Directors of the Company (or any committee thereof) is prepared
to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal
and terminate this Agreement (it being understood that the Company shall
be required to deliver a new Notice in respect of any revised Superior
Proposal (other than immaterial revisions) from such third party or its
Affiliates that the Company proposes to accept, attaching the most current
version of such agreement to such Notice and including the other
information required by Section 5.3(c) (which information shall be updated on
a current basis)), and only if at the end of such five business day period,
after taking into account any revised terms as may have been 

  ##### 

  

   

proposed by Parent in writing (and not withdrawn) since its receipt of such
Notice, the Board of Directors of the Company (or committee thereof) has
again in good faith made the determination referred to above in this clause
(y).

 " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, relating to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries) equal to 20% or more of the Companys consolidated assets or to which 20% or more of the Companys consolidated revenues on a consolidated basis for the then preceding four completed and publicly reported calendar quarters are attributable, (B) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) of 20% or more of the Company Common Stock, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) beneficially owning 20% or more of the Company Common Stock or (D) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; in each case, other than the Transactions. 

   

 " _Superior Proposal_ " means a written Takeover Proposal made by a third party and not initiated, solicited, facilitated or encouraged in violation of this Agreement, which is on terms and conditions which the Board of Directors of the Company (or committee thereof) determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with the Financial Advisor or another financial advisor of national reputation) to be more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view (taking into account all terms and conditions of the Takeover Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and financial terms, and the ability of the Person making such proposal to consummate the transactions contemplated by such proposal, based upon, among other things, the availability of financing and the expectation of obtaining required approvals) than the Merger and the other Transactions, taking into account at the time of determination any changes to the terms of this Agreement that as of that time had been proposed by Parent in writing (and not withdrawn), except that the reference to " _20%_ " in the definition of " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall be deemed to be a reference to " _50%_ ". 

  

 (f) Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act if such Board of Directors determines in good faith, after receiving the advice of outside counsel, that failure to so disclose such position would be inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such disclosure has the effect of withdrawing or modifying the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or the approval of this Agreement by the Board of Directors of the Company, Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement to the extent set forth in Section 7.1(c)(iii) of this Agreement. 

   #####

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper and advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party shall: (i) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable and supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act; (ii) make any additional filings required by any applicable Competition Law and take all other actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or other Competition Laws as promptly as practicable; and (iii) subject to applicable Laws relating to access to and the exchange of information, use its reasonable best efforts to (A) cooperate with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry under or relating to any Competition Law; (B) keep the other parties informed of any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other Governmental Authority and of any communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions; and (C) permit the other parties hereto to review in advance any communication intended to be given by it to, and consult with the other parties in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any such other Governmental Authority, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Authority, give the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences. To the extent permitted by Law, Parent shall have the right to direct all matters relating to compliance with Competition Laws in connection with any Transaction. 

  

 (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in Section 5.4(a), but subject to Section 5.4(c), in the event that any legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceeding, claim, suit or action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Authority or private party under any Competition Laws challenging any of the Transactions or in the event that any Governmental Authority shall otherwise object to any of the Transactions, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts: (A) to vigorously defend, contest and resist any such proceeding, claim, suit, action or challenge; (B) to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions; and (C) to resolve objections. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates be obligated to, and the Company shall not, without Parents prior written consent, propose or agree to accept any undertaking or condition, enter into any consent decree, make any divestiture, accept any operational restriction or take or commit to take any action that would reasonably be expected to limit: (i) the freedom of action of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates with respect to the operation of, or Parents ability to retain, the Company or any businesses, product lines or assets of the Company, or 

   ##### 

  

    

(ii) Parents or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates ability to retain, own or
operate any portion of the businesses, product lines or assets of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or alter or restrict in any way the
business or commercial practices of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
or the Company or its Subsidiaries (any such event, a " _Burdensome
Condition_ "). 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.4 shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) or (ii) so long as such party has up to then complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 5.4. 

  

 (e) Neither the Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall take any action that would result in any state takeover statute or similar Law becoming applicable to any of the Transactions. If any state takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable to any of the Transactions, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the Transactions. 

  

 Section 5.5 _Stockholders Meetings_. 

  

 (a) Subject to Section 5.5(c), the Company shall establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") solely for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. Subject to Section 5.3(d), the Company shall, through its Board of Directors, make the Company Board Recommendation and include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The Company will (i) use all reasonable efforts to solicit or cause to be solicited from its stockholders proxies in favor of adoption of this Agreement and (ii) subject to Section 5.3(d), take all other reasonable action necessary to secure the Company Stockholder Approval. Except to the extent required by Law, the Company shall not (A) change the date specified in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus for the Company Stockholders Meeting, or (B) postpone, delay or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting, except, in each case, after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure that any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus required by applicable Law (or contemplated by Section 5.15) is provided to the stockholders of the Company sufficiently in advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting or if there are an insufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock represented in person or by proxy at the Company Stockholders Meeting to constitute a quorum or adopt this Agreement or, if the Parent Stockholders Meeting is adjourned in accordance with Section 5.5(b), in order to comply with Section 5.5(c), in which case the Company may adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting and use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a quorum and/or the Company Stockholder Approval as promptly as practicable in the prevailing circumstances. 

  

 (b) Subject to Section 5.5(c) and Section 5.15, Parent shall establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its stockholders (the " _Parent Stockholders Meeting_ ") solely for the purposes of considering and voting upon (i) the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger (the " _Issuance Proposal_ "), (ii) the amendment of the Parents Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Parent Common Stock to a number to be reasonably determined by Parent which shall be no less than 

   ##### 

  

    

the number sufficient to consummate the Transactions (the " _Charter
Amendment Proposal_ "), and (iii) at Parents discretion, to increase the
number of shares authorized for grant under the Parent Stock Plans (the "
_Plan Amendment Proposal_ "). The Board of Directors of Parent shall
recommend approval of the Issuance Proposal and the Charter Amendment
Proposal by the stockholders of Parent and include such recommendation in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Neither the Board of Directors of Parent nor
any committee thereof shall qualify, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse
to the Company, or propose publicly to qualify, withdraw or modify, in a
manner adverse to Company, the Parent Board Recommendation other than
a withdrawal of the Parent Board Recommendation in connection with the
cancellation of the Parent Stockholders Meeting as contemplated by Section
5.15 or as otherwise required by Law. Subject to the foregoing, Parent will
use all reasonable efforts to solicit or cause to be solicited from
its stockholders proxies in favor of, and take all other reasonable action
necessary to secure, the Parent Stockholder Approval. Except to the extent
required by Law, Parent shall not (A) change the date specified in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus for the Parent Stockholders Meeting, or (B) postpone,
delay or adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting, except, in each case,
after consultation with the Company, to the extent necessary to ensure that
any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus required by
applicable Law is provided to the stockholders of Parent sufficiently in
advance of the Parent Stockholders Meeting or if there are an
insufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock represented in person or
by proxy at the Parent Stockholders Meeting to constitute a quorum or adopt
this Agreement or, if the Company Stockholders Meeting is adjourned in
accordance with Section 5.5(a), in order to comply with Section 5.5(c),
in which case the Company may adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting and use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a quorum and/or the Parent
Stockholder Approval as promptly as practicable in the prevailing
circumstances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent has duly made a
Financing Election pursuant to Section 5.15, Parent may nevertheless establish
a record date for, duly call, and give notice to its stockholders of a Parent
Stockholders Meeting solely for the purposes of considering and voting upon
the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Plan Amendment Proposal. 

  

 (c) The parties will consult with one another to coordinate record, mailing and meeting dates for the Company Stockholders Meeting and (subject to Section 5.15) the Parent Stockholders Meeting, and will use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Stockholders Meeting and (subject to Section 5.15) the Parent Stockholders Meeting to be held, as soon as practicable following the date upon which the Registration Statement becomes effective. Unless the Company and Parent mutually agree, (i) neither the Company nor Parent shall distribute the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to its stockholders until the net proceeds of the Debt Financing or the Financing are deposited in escrow or released to Parent as required by Section 5.14 or 5.15, as the case may be, (ii) the parties shall not establish record, mailing or meeting dates prior to the Financing Election Deadline, and (iii) the Parent Stockholders Meeting and the Company Stockholders Meeting shall be held on the same date. Notwithstanding clauses (ii) and (iii) of this Section 5.5(c), if (A) the Company has received a proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact, or any information is requested from the Company, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with the Company, in each case in respect of any Takeover Proposal, and (B) Parent notifies the Company pursuant to the last two sentences of Section 5.15(a) that it has either completed or terminated its efforts to secure the Financing, the parties shall promptly and within three (3) business days thereof, establish record, mailing and meeting dates, which dates should be as soon as reasonably feasible thereafter. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 5.6 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter and prior to the Effective Time, neither the Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other Transactions without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except (i) as may be required by Law (including, without limitation, as permitted by Section 5.3(f)) or by any applicable listing agreement with a national securities exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the party proposing to make such release (in which case such party shall not issue or cause the publication of such press release or other public announcement without prior consultation with the other party) or (ii) for press releases or announcements to be issued with respect to actions taken by the Company or its Board of Directors as permitted by and in accordance with Section 5.3. 

  

 Section 5.7 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 (b) Except for disclosures permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of September 17, 2009 between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), each party and its Representatives shall hold information received from the other party and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 5.7 in confidence in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect following execution (or termination) of this Agreement, provided that, solely with respect to communications relating to the Merger, this Agreement and the Transactions made in compliance therewith, this Section 5.7 hereof shall supersede any conflicting provision of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 (c) No investigation by the Company or Parent or their respective representatives or advisors prior to or after the date of this Agreement shall diminish, obviate or 

   ##### 

  

    

cure any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement or otherwise affect such Persons rights under
Articles I, VI and VII of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Transactions, (iii) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause any representation or warranty made by such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.3(a) would not be satisfied and (iv) any failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(b) or 6.3(b) would not be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall not (x) be considered an admission that any representation or warranty is untrue for purposes of Article VI or Article VII, (y) cure any breach or non-compliance with any other provision of this Agreement or (z) limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice; _provided_ , _further_ , that the failure to deliver any notice pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall not be considered in determining whether the condition set forth in Section 6.2(b) or 6.3(b) has been satisfied or the related termination right in Article VII is available except to the extent that a party hereto is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. 

  

 Section 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation) indemnify the individuals who at or prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company (collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by (A) the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement, (B) any applicable contract as in effect on the date of this Agreement and (C) applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to indemnify any Indemnitee for such Indemnitees criminal conduct or fraud. 

  

 (b) Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, the Indemnitees (as defined to mean those persons currently insured under the Companys directors and officers insurance and indemnification policy) with an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is no less favorable than the existing policy or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 

   ##### 

  

    

300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance,
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available
for a cost not exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Surviving Corporation may fulfill its obligation to provide insurance under
this Section 5.9(b) by obtaining a prepaid "tail" policy of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and condition which are, in the
aggregate, no less favorable to the insured than the existing policy,
and maintaining such "tail" policy in full force and effect for a period of
at least six (6) years. 

  

 (c) The Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.9 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.9. The provisions of this Section 5.9 are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her representatives. 

  

 (d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9. 

  

 Section 5.10 _Securityholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of, and the opportunity to participate in, the defense or settlement of any securityholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

  

 Section 5.11 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, and except as otherwise contemplated under Section 7.3 of the Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and Parent shall share equally (a) the filing fee of Parents pre-merger notification report under the HSR Act and all fees and expenses incurred by Parent or the Company in seeking approvals under all other applicable Competition Laws, and (b) all fees and expenses, other than accountants and attorneys fees, incurred with respect to the printing, filing and mailing of the Form S-4 Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, including any amendments or supplements thereto. 

  

 Section 5.12 _Employee Benefits_. 

  

 (a) Without limiting the provisions of Section 5.12(d) hereof, for a period of time of at least one year following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide each employee who continues employment with the Surviving Corporation (a " _Continuing Employee_ ") with combined aggregate pay (which shall include rates of base salary or wages and annual bonus opportunities) and employee benefits comparable to the pay and benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Affiliates, provided that for such purposes of this covenant, stock options and other equity awards shall be disregarded. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Continuing Employees shall also be provided credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose by the Company and its Subsidiaries for such Continuing Employees, under (i) all employee benefit plans, programs, policies and fringe benefits (other than stock option and other equity award programs) arrangements to be provided to such employees for purposes of eligibility and vesting, (ii) severance plans, programs and policies to be provided to such employees for purposes of calculating the amount of each such employees severance benefits and (iii) vacation and sick leave plans, programs and policies for purposes of calculating the amount of each such employees vacation and sick leave, except, in each case, as would result in a duplication of benefits. With respect to each employee benefit plan, program or policy of Parent or its Subsidiaries that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, and without regard to whether ERISA applies thereto) in which Continuing Employees participate following the Effective Time, Parent or its Subsidiaries shall cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition limitations. In addition, to the extent permissible under the terms of such plan, if the effective time at which a Continuing Employee participates in any such plan falls within an annual period of coverage under such plan, each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for covered expenses paid by that Continuing Employee and his or her dependents under comparable Company plans during the applicable coverage period through such effective time toward satisfaction of any annual deductible limitation and out-of-pocket maximum that may apply under that plan of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume and either shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, discharge the obligations under each employment, severance or retention agreement (including the establishment and funding of any related rabbi trust) listed in Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 5.12 shall impede or limit Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates from terminating any of their employees at any time for any reason or no reason, subject to the provisions of applicable Law. 

  

 (e) The Company and its ERISA Affiliates, as applicable, shall not terminate any plan intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (collectively, the " _4_ _01(k)_ _Plans_ ") unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that one or more of the 401(k) Plans should be terminated effective no later than the last day of the payroll period immediately preceding the Closing Date. If Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no later than seven (7) business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide to Parent (i) copies of duly adopted resolutions by the Companys Board of Directors authorizing the termination of such 401(k) Plans and (ii) with respect to each 401(k) Plan, an executed amendment to the 401(k) Plan sufficient to assure compliance with all applicable requirements of the Code and regulations thereunder so that the tax-qualified status of the 401(k) Plan shall be maintained at the time of termination. The form and substance of such resolutions and amendment shall be subject to the prior review and approval of Parent. 

  

 (f) The provisions of this Section 5.12 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party 

   ##### 

  

    

beneficiary of this Section 5.12 and nothing herein shall be construed as an
amendment to any Company Plan for any purpose. 

  

 Section 5.13 _NASDAQ Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Article II to be approved for listing upon the Effective Time on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance. 

  

 Section 5.14 _Debt Financing_. 

  

 (a) Until such time as Parent duly makes a Financing Election in accordance with Section 5.15, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things commercially necessary, proper or advisable to maintain in effect the Commitment Letter. 

  

 (b) From and after the earlier of (i) the date Parent delivers notice to the Company pursuant to the last two sentences of Section 5.15(a), or (ii) the Financing Election Deadline if Parent does not deliver such a notice and does not duly make a Financing Election under Section 5.15 below, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things commercially necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including commercially reasonable efforts to (A) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the Debt Financing, (B) enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on terms and conditions (including the "flex" provisions) contained in, or consistent in all material respects with, the Commitment Letter, and (C) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing. In addition, Parent shall ensure that the net proceeds of the Debt Financing have been deposited into escrow, or otherwise released to Parent, in accordance with the terms of the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing, or will be deposited into escrow, or otherwise released to Parent, in accordance with the terms of the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing, by no later than the earlier of January 8, 2010 or the date upon which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company and, if deposited into escrow, the terms of the definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing do not impose any material conditions on the release of such net proceeds from escrow other than the consummation of the Merger as provided in this Agreement and the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter. Parent shall (1) keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing, (2) give the Company prompt notice (x) of any material breach by any Lender under the Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements relating thereto of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, (y) if and when Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware that any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter is not available to consummate the Transactions, and (z) of any termination of the Commitment Letter, and (3) provide to the Company copies of executed copies of the definitive agreements relating thereto (with confidential fee terms redacted). In the event that all conditions to the Debt Financing have been or, upon funding will be, satisfied, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (which may include, in Parents discretion after consultation with the Company, the pursuit of any claim or action for specific performance of the terms of the Debt Financing) to cause the Lenders and any other lenders involved therein to fund on the Closing Date the Debt Financing required to consummate the Merger and related Transactions.

 (c) Notwithstanding Section 5.15(b), Parent shall not be permitted to make the Financing Election (i) if the Financing Election and the Financing would reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) if, after giving effect to the Adjusted Exchange Ratio and including any equity securities required to be issued in connection with the Financing, the approval of Parents stockholders would be required under the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market in order to permit Parent to consummate the Merger and the Financing.

 (i) The Financing Election complies with the conditions of this Section 5.15; 

   

 (ii) The Financing Agreements have not been amended or modified, in any respect;

Section 8.8 are not available or otherwise are not granted and (b) nothing
set forth in this Section 8.8 shall require any party hereto to institute
any proceeding for (or limit any partys right to institute any proceeding

exercising any termination right under Article VII (and pursuing damages
after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding
pursuant to this Section 8.8 or anything set forth in this Section 8.8
restrict or limit any partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of Article VII or pursue any other remedies under this
Agreement that may be available then or thereafter. Each party further agrees
that no other party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish
or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition
to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 8.8, and each party
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing

The consent to jurisdiction set forth in this paragraph shall not constitute general consent to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties hereto.
