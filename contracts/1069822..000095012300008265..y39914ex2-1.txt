COPY    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as
of August 23, 2000, between The MONY Group Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), MONY Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and The Advest Group, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company").   RECITALS   A. Parent and the Company each
have determined that a business combination between Parent and the Company is
in the best interests of their respective companies and stockholders and
presents an opportunity for their respective companies to achieve long-term
strategic and financial benefits, and accordingly have agreed to effect the
merger provided for herein upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein.   B. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, in
order to induce Parent and Merger Sub to enter into the Agreement,
certain stockholders of the Company are entering into a support agreement
(the "Support Agreement") with Parent, providing for certain voting and other
restrictions with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock (as defined
herein) beneficially owned by them upon the terms and conditions specified
therein.   C. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, in
order to induce Parent and Merger Sub to enter into the Agreement, the
Company is entering into an option agreement with Parent pursuant to which
Parent shall be granted the right to purchase up to 19.9% of the issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock upon the occurrence of certain
events as set forth therein (the "Option Agreement").   D. It is intended
that for federal income tax purposes, the merger provided for herein shall
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
(as defined in Section 3.12).   E. Merger Sub is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent and has been formed solely to facilitate the Merger (as defined
herein) and has conducted and will conduct no business or activity other than
in connection with the Merger.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
foregoing, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:   6  
ARTICLE 1   THE MERGER   1.1 THE MERGER.   Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section
1.3), the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub in accordance with
this Agreement, and the separate corporate existence of the Company shall
thereupon cease (the "Merger"). Merger Sub shall be the surviving corporation
in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving
Corporation") and will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger
shall have the effects specified in the Delaware General Corporation Law
("DGCL").   1.2 THE CLOSING.   Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place (a) at
the offices of Dewey Ballantine LLP, 1301 Avenue of the Americas, New York,
New York, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the first business day immediately
following the day on which the last to be fulfilled or waived of the
conditions set forth in Article 6 shall be fulfilled or waived in accordance
herewith or (b) at such other time, date or place as Parent and the Company
may agree in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter
referred to as the "Closing Date."   1.3 EFFECTIVE TIME.   If all the
conditions set forth in Article 6 shall have been fulfilled or waived in
accordance herewith and this Agreement shall not have been terminated as
provided in Article 7, the parties hereto shall cause a Certificate of Merger
meeting the requirements of Section 251 of the DGCL to be properly executed
and filed in accordance with such Section on the Closing Date. The Merger
shall become effective at the time of filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the
DGCL or at such later time which the parties hereto shall have agreed
upon and designated in such filings as the effective time of the Merger
(the "Effective Time").   1.4 THE CHARTER AND BYLAWS.   (a) The
Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time (with Article First thereof amended to read in its
entirety as follows: "The name of the corporation is: The Advest Group,
Inc.") shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
as of the Effective Time until duly amended as provided therein or by
applicable law.   (b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation as of
the Effective Time, until thereafter amended as provided therein or by
applicable law.    2  7   1.5 DIRECTORS OF THE SURVIVING
CORPORATION.   The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation as of the
Effective Time and until their successors are duly appointed or elected in
accordance with applicable law.   1.6 OFFICERS OF THE SURVIVING
CORPORATION.   The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time and until their successors are duly appointed or elected in accordance
with applicable law.   ARTICLE 2   CONVERSION AND EXCHANGE OF
SECURITIES   2.1 MERGER SUB STOCK.   At the Effective Time, each share of
common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Merger Sub outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged
for one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock,
par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   2.2 COMPANY
STOCK.   (a) At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of
this Section 2.2., each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of
the Company including all associated Rights (as defined in Section 3.22)
("Company Common Stock"), other than shares canceled pursuant to Section
2.2(c) and Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.2(m)), if any, issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into the right to receive, at the option of the holder as
contemplated by Sections 2.2(d) through 2.2(i), (i) an amount in cash equal
to the product of (A) the average closing price per share of the common
stock, par value $.01, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") on the New York
Stock Exchange ("NYSE") for the ten consecutive trading days ending on the
fifth trading day prior to the Closing Date, as set forth in the Eastern
edition of the Wall Street Journal or, if not reported therein, any other
authoritative source ("Average Price") and (B) the Exchange Ratio (as such
term is defined and calculated pursuant to Annex A hereto, based on the
Average Price), without interest, (the "Cash Price Per Share"), (ii) a number
of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (together with
the associated rights issued pursuant to the Parent Rights Agreement
(as defined in Section 4.3)) or (iii) a combination of cash and Parent Common
Stock (together with the associated rights) determined in accordance with
this Section (each of the foregoing, the "Merger Consideration").   (b) As
a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, at the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
be outstanding and shall cease to    3   8  exist, and each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares,
which shall have the rights contemplated by Section 262 of the DGCL), except
the right to receive, without interest, the consideration contemplated by
Section 2.2(a) and cash in accordance with Sections 2.3(c) and 2.3(e) upon
the surrender of a certificate (a "Certificate") representing such shares of
Company Common Stock.   (c) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned
by Parent or any of Parent\'s wholly-owned subsidiaries or held in the
Company\'s treasury at the Effective Time ("Parent Shares") shall, by virtue
of the Merger, cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist without payment of any consideration therefor.   (d)
Subject to the provisions of this Section 2.2, each record holder of shares
of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
entitled to elect to receive either (i) the Cash Price Per Share for all of
such holder\'s shares ("Cash Election"), (ii) the Cash Price Per Share for
a stated number of such holder\'s shares and a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio per share of Company Common Stock
for the balance of such holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock ("Partial
Cash Election") or (iii) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the Exchange Ratio per share of Company Common Stock for all of such
holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock ("Stock Election"). All Cash
Elections, Partial Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall be unconditional
and made on a form designed for that purpose and mutually agreeable to Parent
and the Company (a "Form of Election"). Any holder of Company Common Stock
who fails to properly make a Cash Election, Partial Cash Election or Stock
Election and any holder who fails to submit to the Paying Agent referred to
below a properly completed and signed and properly and timely submitted Form
of Election shall be deemed to have indicated no preference as to the receipt
of cash or Parent Common Stock with respect to such holder\'s shares (a "Non-
Election") and will receive the Merger Consideration described below.   (e)
The aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into
the right to receive cash in the Merger (which shall include Dissenting
Shares, if any) shall be equal to 49.9% of the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Parent Shares) (the "Cash Election Number").
The remaining number of such issued and outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Parent Shares) (the
"Stock Election Number") shall be converted into the right to receive Parent
Common Stock in the Merger; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Stock Election Number shall
equal as nearly as practicable 50.1% of the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Parent Shares).   (f) If the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock for which cash was elected under a Cash Election or a
Partial Cash Election plus Dissenting    4  9  Shares, if any,
(collectively, the "Cash Election Shares") exceeds the Cash Election Number,
then all shares of Company Common Stock for which Parent Common Stock was
elected under a Stock Election or a Partial Cash Election (collectively, the
"Stock Election Shares") and all shares of Company Common Stock covered by
Non-Elections (the "Non-Election Shares") shall be converted into the right
to receive Parent Common Stock, and the Cash Election Shares (other than
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive cash and
Parent Common Stock in the following manner:   Each Cash Election Share
(other than Dissenting Shares) shall be  converted into the right to receive
(A) an amount of cash (rounded  to the nearest cent), without interest, equal
to the product of  (x) the Cash Price Per Share and (y) a fraction (the
"Cash  Fraction"), the numerator of which shall be the Cash Election  Number
and the denominator of which shall be the total number of  Cash Election
Shares and (B) a number of shares of Parent Common  Stock equal to the
product of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) a  fraction equal to one (1) minus
the Cash Fraction.   (g) If the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares
exceeds the Stock Election Number, all Cash Election Shares and all Non-
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive cash, and all
Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive Parent
Common Stock and cash in the following manner:   Each Stock Election Share
shall be converted into the right to  receive (A) a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the  product of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) a
fraction (the "Stock  Fraction"), the numerator of which shall be the Stock
Election  Number and the denominator of which shall be the total number of 
Stock Election Shares, and (B) an amount of cash (rounded to the  nearest
cent), without interest, equal to the product of (x) the  Cash Price Per
Share and (y) a fraction equal to one (1) minus the  Stock Fraction.   (h)
In the event that neither subparagraph (f) or (g) above is applicable, all
Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive cash, all
Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive Parent
Common Stock, and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right
to receive (A) an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest cent), without
interest, equal to the product of (x) the Cash Price Per Share and (y)
a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Cash Election Number less the
Cash Election Shares and the denominator of which shall be the Non-Election
Shares, and (B) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which
shall be the Stock Election Number less the Stock Election Shares and the
denominator of which shall be the Non-Election Shares.   (i) The Company
shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause copies of the Form of Election
(which shall contain a Letter of Transmittal (as defined herein)) to be
mailed with the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as defined in Section 5.7) to the
record holders of Company Common Stock (other than holders of Dissenting
Shares) as    5  10  of the record date for the Company Stockholders
Meeting and to make the Form of Election available to all persons who become
record holders of Company Common Stock during the period between such record
date and the Election Deadline referred to below. A properly completed Form
of Election must be received by the Paying Agent by 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, on the second business day preceding the Closing Date (the "Election
Deadline"), which day shall not be less than 20 days after the initial
mailing of the Form of Election, in order to be effective. An election by a
holder of Company Common Stock shall be validly made only if the Paying Agent
shall have timely received a Form of Election properly completed and executed
(with the signature or signatures thereon guaranteed as required by the Form
of Election) by that shareholder accompanied either by the Certificate or
Certificates representing all of the shares of Company Common Stock owned by
that shareholder, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for
transfer on the books of the Company, or by an appropriate guarantee of
delivery in the form customarily used in transactions of this nature from a
member of a national securities exchange, a member of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or a commercial bank or
trust company in the United States. All elections may be revoked until the
Election Deadline in writing by the record holders submitting Forms of
Election. Parent shall have the authority, in its sole discretion, to make
all determinations as to whether or not a Form of Election has been timely
received.   (j) The Company shall cause a Stock Election to be made
with respect to each Company Common Share owned beneficially or of record by
any subsidiary of the Company or any other affiliate of the Company or any
employee benefit plan controlled by the Company.   (k) Effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company\'s 1993 Stock Option
Plan, 1999 Stock Option Plan, 1994 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan,
2000 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan and Equity Plan (collectively,
the "Company Stock Option Plans") or under any other outstanding option,
warrant or similar agreements granting options, warrants or similar rights to
purchase capital stock of the Company (the "Company Options"), whether or not
then exercisable or vested, will be cancelled and, in consideration thereof,
the Company (or, at Parent\'s option, Merger Sub) will pay to each holder of
a Company Option an amount in cash in respect thereof equal to the product of
(x) the excess, if any, of the Cash Price Per Share over the exercise price
of each such Company Option and (y) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock previously subject to the Company Option immediately prior to its
cancellation (such payment to be net of any withholding taxes required by the
Code or other applicable law). The Company agrees to take or cause to
be taken all action necessary under such Company Options to provide for
such cancellation and payment.   (l) The Company Stock Option Plans shall
terminate as of the Effective Time, and the provisions in any other plan or
arrangement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries providing for the
offering, issuance, purchase, transfer or grant of any capital stock of the
Company or any interest in respect of any capital stock of the Company shall
be deleted as of the Effective Time, and following the Effective Time
no    6  11  holder of any Company Option or warrant or any participant
in any Company Stock Option Plan or other plan or arrangement of the Company
shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of the Company
or the Surviving Corporation.   (m) Prior to the Closing Date the Company
shall take all necessary and appropriate actions to provide that, upon the
Effective Time, 50% of each restricted stock award or deferred stock award or
any other stock-based award (other than the Options), the value of which is
based upon the value of the Company Common Stock (collectively, the "Stock
Awards") which is at the Effective Time subject to any vesting requirement
which would not be accelerated as a result of the transactions contemplated
in this Agreement and which was issued pursuant to a Company Stock Option
Plan or any of the Company\'s Non-Employee Director Equity Plan, Key
Professional Equity Plan, Equity Plan, 1998 Equity Plan, 1997 Equity Plan, or
1995 Equity Plan or any other similar plans, programs or arrangements, or
pursuant to any individual restricted stock agreements between the Company
and certain executive employees, shall become fully vested and payable or
distributable 100% in cash (based upon the Cash Price Per Share). At the
Effective Time, the remaining 50% of such Stock Awards which are outstanding
immediately prior thereto shall be converted automatically into stock awards
for such number of shares of Parent Common Stock as shall be equal to the
product of the number of shares of such Company Common Stock multiplied by
the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock resulting therefrom shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share. The
terms of the new stock awards shall otherwise be the same as the
original stock awards, except all references to The Advest Group, Inc. shall
be deemed to be references to The MONY Group Inc. The Company agrees to take
or cause to be taken all actions necessary under such Stock Awards to provide
for such acceleration and payment. No Stock Award shall be subject to any
election pursuant to Section 2.2 (d) - (h).   (n) To the extent that
holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised and
perfected his demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, but the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled
to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL; provided, however, that if any such holder shall have failed to
perfect or shall effectively withdraw or lose his right to appraisal and
payment under the DGCL, each of such holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Agreement with respect to those shares, as though such shares as of the
Effective Time were Non-Election Shares. The Company shall give Parent (a)
prompt notice of any written demands for fair value received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other related instruments
served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the Company and
(b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for fair value under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make    7  12  any
payment with respect to any demands for fair value for Dissenting Shares
or offer to settle, or settle, any such demands.   2.3 EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES REPRESENTING COMPANY COMMON STOCK.   (a) Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall appoint EquiServe, or such other institution as may be
reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as paying agent (the "Paying
Agent") for the payment of Merger Consideration upon surrender of
certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock. As of the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, an amount of cash and certificates representing such number of shares
of Parent Common Stock required to effect the conversion of Company Common
Stock into Parent Common Stock and cash pursuant to Section 2.2, plus
additional cash in an amount equal to Parent\'s good faith estimate of
the cash required to be paid to holders of shares of Company Common Stock in
lieu of fractional shares expected to be payable in connection with the
Merger (such cash and certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto (relating
to record dates for such dividends or distributions after the Effective
Time), being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") to be issued
pursuant to Section 2.2 and paid pursuant to this Section 2.3 in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.   (b) Promptly after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) that
has not timely submitted a properly completed and executed Form of Election
accompanied by an appropriately endorsed Certificate or Certificates
representing all of the shares of Company Common Stock owned by that
shareholder (or, alternatively, by an appropriate guarantee of delivery) (i)
a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to such shares of Company Common Stock shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates representing such shares to the Paying
Agent and which letter shall be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify (a "Letter of Transmittal") and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Common
Stock Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration contemplated by
Section 2.2 and this Section 2.3, including cash in lieu of fractional
shares. After the Effective Time, the holders of all Certificates previously
submitted with a Form of Election and of those subsequently surrendered for
cancellation to the Paying Agent together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, into which the shares
of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate have been
converted in accordance with Section 2.2, (y) the amount of cash, if any, to
which such holder is entitled in accordance with Section 2.2 and (z) the
amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, if any,
and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, that such holder has the
right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to the
provisions of this Article 2, after giving effect to any required withholding
tax, and the shares represented by the     8  13  Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on the cash payable to holders of shares of Company Common Stock. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate
representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock, together
with a check for the cash to be paid may be issued to the transferee if the
Certificate representing such Company Common Stock is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid.   (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement,
no dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time on
Parent Common Stock shall be paid with respect to any shares of Company
Common Stock represented by a Certificate, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.3
(e), until such Certificate is surrendered for exchange as provided herein.
Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(e) and the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and not
paid, less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon,
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, less the amount of any withholding
taxes which may be required thereon.   (d) At or after the Effective Time,
there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the
shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock and cash deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this Article 2. Certificates surrendered for exchange by any
person constituting an "affiliate" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145(c)
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), shall
not be exchanged until Parent has received a written agreement from such
person as provided in Section 5.9.   (e) No fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued pursuant hereto. In lieu of the issuance of any
fractional share of Parent Common Stock, cash adjustments will be paid to
holders in respect of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock that would
otherwise be issuable, and the amount of such cash adjustment shall be equal
to the product obtained by multiplying such stockholder\'s fractional share
of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable by the Average Price.
In lieu of depositing with the Paying Agent the amount of cash to be paid to
holders of fractional interests, Parent shall have the right to deliver to
the Paying Agent the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger (the    9  14  "Aggregate Shares"). Thereupon the
Paying Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of Aggregate Shares
over (ii) the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in
the Merger (the "Excess Shares"). Following the Effective Time, the Paying
Agent, as agent for the holders of the Aggregate Shares, shall sell the
Excess Shares at the prevailing prices on the NYSE. The sale of the Excess
Shares by the Paying Agent shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more
member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent
practicable. The Paying Agent shall use all reasonable best efforts to
complete the sale of the Excess Shares as promptly following the Effective
Time as, in the Paying Agent\'s reasonable judgment, is
practicable consistent with obtaining the best execution of such sales in
light of prevailing market conditions. Until the net proceeds of such sale or
sales have been distributed to the holders of Company Common Stock, the
Paying Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such holders (the "Common
Shares Trust"). Parent shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other
out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of
the Paying Agent, incurred in connection with such sale of the Excess Shares.
The Paying Agent shall determine the portion of the Common Shares Trust to
which each holder of shares shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the
amount of the aggregate net proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of fractional share interests
to which such holder is entitled (after taking into account all shares of
Company Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder) and the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional shares interests
to which all holders of Company Common Stock are entitled.   (f) Any
portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments
thereof and any shares of Parent Common Stock) that remains unclaimed by the
former stockholders of the Company six months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Parent. Any former stockholders of the Company who have not
theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to
Parent, and Parent shall comply with such requests, made in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, for payment of their shares of Parent Common
Stock, cash and unpaid dividends and distributions on Parent Common Stock
deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such stockholder
holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any
interest thereon.   (g) None of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other person shall be liable (except to
the extent provided by applicable law) to any former holder of shares of
Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.   (h)
In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by such person of
a bond in such amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.    10  15  
2.4 ADJUSTMENT OF EXCHANGE RATIO.   In the event that, subsequent to the
date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock, respectively, shall
have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class as a
result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, combination, exchange, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted.   ARTICLE

business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of
any other state of the United States in which the character of the properties

Effect (as defined below). The Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, operate and lease its properties and carry on its
business as now conducted or as reasonably contemplated in the future. Each
of the Company\'s Subsidiaries is a corporation or partnership duly

not file Tax Returns that the Company or any such Subsidiary or Investment

"Transaction"). The Company may, directly or indirectly, prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting (as defined below), furnish non-confidential information
and access, in each case only in response to unsolicited requests therefor,
to any corporation, partnership, person or other entity or group, and may,
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, participate in discussions and
negotiate with such entity or group concerning any Transaction if such entity
or group has submitted a written proposal to the Company Board, prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting, relating to any such Transaction (an
"Alternative Proposal") and the Company Board by a majority vote determines
in its good faith judgment, after consultation as to legal matters with
outside legal counsel and after consultation as to financial matters with an
investment banking firm of national reputation, that the Alternative Proposal
is a Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined) and that failing to take such
action would constitute a breach of the Company Board\'s fiduciary duty. The
Company Board shall provide a copy of any such written proposal to Parent
immediately after receipt thereof and thereafter keep Parent promptly advised
of any development with respect thereto. Except as set forth above, neither
the Company or any of its affiliates, nor any of its or their respective
officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents, shall, directly or
indirectly, encourage, solicit, participate in or initiate discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to, any corporation,
partnership, person or other entity or group (other than Parent and Merger
Sub, any affiliate or associate of Parent and Merger Sub or any designees of
Parent and Merger Sub) concerning, or enter into any agreement with
respect to, any Transaction, provided, however, that nothing herein shall
prevent the Company Board from taking, and disclosing to the Company\'s
shareholders, a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act with regard to any tender offers; provided, further,
that the Company Board shall not recommend that the shareholders of the
Company tender their outstanding shares of Company Common Stock in connection
with any such tender offer or exchange offer unless the Company Board by a
majority vote determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation as to
legal matters with outside legal counsel and after consultation as to
financial matters with an investment banking firm of national reputation,
that the tender offer is a Superior Proposal and that failing to take such
action would constitute a breach of the Company Board\'s fiduciary duty under
applicable laws. Nothing in this Section 5.1 shall (x) permit the Company to
terminate this Agreement (except as specifically provided in Article 7
hereof), (y) permit the    30  35  Company to accept or enter into any
agreement with respect to an Alternative Proposal during the term of this
Agreement (it being agreed that during the term of this Agreement, the
Company shall not enter into any agreement with any person that provides for,
or in any way facilitates, an Alternative Proposal), or (z) affect any other
obligation of the Company under this Agreement.   For purposes of this
Agreement "Superior Proposal" means any Alternative Proposal with respect to
a Transaction which (a) is superior to the Merger from a financial point of
view to the stockholders of the Company, (b) faces no material legal or other
impediments to consummation, and (c) is fully financed. In deciding whether
an Alternative Proposal is a Superior Proposal, the Company Board shall take
into account, among other things, the tax effect on the Company\'s
stockholders of the Alternative Proposal and the form of consideration
contemplated by the Alternative Proposal.   5.2 INTERIM OPERATIONS.  
Prior to the Effective Time, unless Parent has otherwise consented in writing
thereto, the Company:   (i) shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
and each of  the Investment Companies to, conduct its operations according to
their  usual, regular and ordinary course in substantially the same manner

not, and shall cause its Material Subsidiaries not  to, amend their

indicating that the same may be contemplated), or (z) any material breach  of
any representation or warranty contained herein;   (v) shall, upon receiving
any written notice from any Taxing  authority proposing any adjustment to any
Tax relating to the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries, give prompt written
notice thereof to Parent,  which notice shall describe in detail each

true and correct copies of  any report, statement or schedule filed with the

to, any merger, consolidation or  business combination (other than the

course of business, any  disposition of assets or securities other than in
the ordinary course of  business or any release or relinquishment of any
material contract rights  other than in the ordinary course of business;

or exercisable for shares of its capital stock, except upon  exercise of
options outstanding on the date of this Agreement under the  Company Stock
Option Plans or granted pursuant to the terms of the Stock  Option Agreement
to purchase shares of Company Common Stock, or effect  any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend, subdivision,  reclassification,
combination, exchange, or other similar transaction  with respect to any
shares of its capital stock or other ownership  interests, or otherwise
change its capitalization;   (ix) shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to,  grant, confer or award any options, warrants, conversion
rights or other  rights, not existing on the date hereof, to acquire any
shares of its  capital stock or other securities of the Company or its
Subsidiaries;   (x) shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries
to,  take or fail to take any actions which would, or would be reasonably 
likely to, prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization with  the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code;   (xi) except pursuant to (i)
applicable law, (ii) the terms of  pre-existing contractual arrangements or
policies or (iii) the ordinary  course of business consistent with past
practice, shall not, and shall  not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, amend
the terms of any Company  Plan, including, without limitation, any
employment, severance or similar  agreements or arrangements in existence on
the date hereof, or adopt any  new employee compensation or benefit plans,
programs or arrangements or  any employment, severance or similar agreements
or arrangements, or  change in any respect any vesting schedule with respect
to any Company  Plan or grant or award thereunder, or grant any salary
increases to any  employee of the Company or any Subsidiary;   (xii) except
in the ordinary course consistent with past  practice, shall not, and shall
not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, (x)  incur, create, assume or
otherwise become liable for borrowed money or  assume, guarantee, endorse or

assets, or permit any of its  property or assets to be subjected, to any
lien, claim or encumbrance of  any kind;   (xiii) shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to,  (x) change any practice with respect to
Taxes, (y) make, revoke or change  any election with respect to Taxes or (z)
settle or compromise any Tax  liability;   (xiv) shall not (y) declare, set
aside or pay any dividend or  make any other distribution or payment with
respect to any shares of its  capital stock (other than regular quarterly
cash dividends payable on  Company Common Stock in an amount not to exceed
$0.06 per share) or other  ownership interests or (z) redeem, purchase or
otherwise acquire any  shares of its capital stock, or make any commitment
for any such action;   (xv) shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to,  agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any of the
foregoing actions or  take any action which would make any representation or
warranty in  Article 3 hereof untrue or incorrect.   5.3 MEETING OF
STOCKHOLDERS.   The Company will take all action necessary in accordance
with applicable law and its Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
Restated Bylaws to convene a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company
Stockholders Meeting,") as promptly as practicable, and in any case not more
than 45 days following the declaration of the effectiveness of the Form S-4

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company Board shall
recommend such approval and shall take all lawful action to solicit such
approval, including, without limitation, timely mailing the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (as defined in Section 5.7); provided, however, that
such recommendation or solicitation shall not be required if and to the
extent that the Company Board determines after the date hereof, in its good
faith judgment, after consultation as to legal matters with outside legal
counsel and after consultation as to financial matters with an investment
banking firm of national reputation, that the making of such recommendation
or solicitation would involve a breach of its fiduciary duties to its
stockholders imposed by law.   5.4 FILINGS; OTHER ACTIONS.   Subject to
the terms and conditions herein provided, the Company and Parent shall: (a)
promptly make their respective filings and thereafter make any other required

federal or state governmental or regulatory agency or with any national
securities exchange with respect thereto.   5.7 REGISTRATION STATEMENT.  
Parent and the Company shall cooperate and promptly prepare and Parent shall
file with the SEC as soon as practicable a Registration Statement on Form S-4
(the "Form S-4") under the Securities Act, with respect to the Parent Common

The respective parties will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form

applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts, and

thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement
or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension
of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with

Securities Act. The Company shall provide Parent such information and
documents as Parent shall reasonably request for purposes of reviewing such
list. The Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent, prior to
the Closing Date, from each of    35  40  the Affiliates of the Company

Proxy Statement/Prospectus with the SEC and the expenses incurred in
connection with printing and mailing the Form S-4 and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall be paid one-half by Parent and one-half by the
Company.   5.11 DIRECTORS\' AND OFFICERS\' INDEMNIFICATION AND
INSURANCE.   (a) From and after the Effective Time, in the event of
any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal or administrative, including, without limitation, any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any person who
is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to
be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part
out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director or officer
of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors or was prior to the Effective Time serving at the request of any
such party as a director, officer, fiduciary or agent of another corporation,
partnership, trust or other enterprise or (ii) this Agreement, or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and all actions taken by an Indemnified
Party in connection herewith, whether in any case asserted or arising before
or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate in
connection with defending against and responding to such proceedings. It is
understood and agreed that after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify
and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by the corporate
governance documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof
and by law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding
or investigation to each Indemnified Parry to the fullest extent permitted by
law upon receipt of an undertaking, to the extent required by the DGCL, from
such Indemnified Party to repay such advanced expenses if it is finally and
unappealably determined that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to
indemnification hereunder), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, and in the event of any such threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or
arising before or after the Effective    36  41  Time) (collectively,
"Claims"), the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory
to them after consultation with Parent; provided, however, that except as
otherwise specified by the corporate governance documents of the Company or
its Subsidiaries, (1) Parent shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof by retaining counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Parties and upon such assumption Parent shall not be liable to
any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if Parent elects not to assume such defense
or counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises the Indemnified
Parties that there are or may be (whether or not any have yet actually
arisen) issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent and the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably
satisfactory to them, and Parent shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (2) Parent shall be obligated
pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only one firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties with respect to any Claim or series of related Claims,
(3) Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and (4)
Parent shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and
if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that indemnification
of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
the corporate governance documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
applicable law. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this Section 5.11, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, shall notify Parent thereof in writing, provided that the
failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of Parent under this
Section 5.11 except (and only) to the extent such failure to notify
materially prejudices the Surviving Corporation.   (b) Without limiting any
of the obligations under paragraph (a) of this Section 5.11, Parent agrees
that all rights to indemnification and all limitations of liability existing
in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the Company\'s Certificate
of Incorporation or Bylaws or in the similar governing documents of any of
the Company\'s Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date of this Agreement
with respect to matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Time shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for six (6)
years thereafter, without any amendment thereto; provided, however, that
nothing contained in this Section 5.11(b) shall be deemed to preclude the
liquidation, consolidation or merger of the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof, in which case all of such rights to indemnification and limitations
on liability shall be deemed to so survive and continue notwithstanding any
such liquidation, consolidation or merger and shall constitute rights which
may be asserted against Parent or its successor. Nothing contained in this
Section 5.11(b) shall be deemed to preclude any rights to indemnification or
limitations on liability provided in Parent\'s Articles of Incorporation or
Bylaws or the similar governing documents of any of Parent\'s Subsidiaries
with respect to matters occurring subsequent to the Effective Time to the
extent that the provisions establishing such rights or limitations are not
otherwise amended to the contrary.    37  42   (c) Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the persons serving as officers and
directors of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to be
covered for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date by the
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy maintained by the
Company (provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are
not less advantageous to such directors and officers of the Company than the
terms and conditions of such existing policy and provided further that in no
event will Parent be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess
of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such
insurance (the "Insurance Amount"), and further provided, that if Parent is
unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 5.11(c)
as a result of the preceding proviso, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as available for the Insurance
Amount with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time which were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as
such. The provisions of this Section 5.11 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs
and representatives.   5.12 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS.   In case at any time
after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any
merger between a Subsidiary of Parent and a Subsidiary of the Company) or to
vest the Surviving Company with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the
proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their
respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by Parent.   5.13 SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN AND TAKEOVER
STATUTES.   The Company shall take all action necessary to render the
Rights Agreement and the Rights inapplicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby or by the Option Agreement or Support Agreement. The Company shall not
amend, modify or supplement the Rights Agreement or the Rights without the
prior written consent of Parent. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation, is or
shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby or by the
Option Agreement or the Support Agreement, the Company and the members of the
Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Option
Agreement and by the Support Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and by the Option Agreement and
by the Support Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby
and by the Option Agreement and by the Support Agreement. If requested by
Parent at least three business days prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board shall take all necessary action to terminate or redeem all of the
outstanding Rights and to terminate the Rights Agreement, effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time.    38  43   5.14 CONVEYANCE
TAXES.   The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or
gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees or any similar Taxes which
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Option Agreement and the Support Agreement that are required
or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective Time.   5.15 CERTAIN
TAX MATTERS.   (a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, (i)

prepare and file, or will cause to be prepared and filed, in the manner
required by applicable law, all Tax Returns that are required (with
extensions) to be filed, (ii) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and
the Investment Companies will timely pay all Taxes shown as due and payable,
or required to be shown as due and payable, on such Tax Returns that are so

Companies will make provision for all Taxes payable by the Company and/or any
such Subsidiary and/or Investment Company for which no Tax Return is due
prior to the Effective Time and (iv) the Company will promptly notify Parent
in writing of any action, suit, proceeding, claim or audit pending against or
with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary thereof in respect of any
Tax.   (b) The Company agrees that it will, and will cause its Subsidiaries
and the Investment Companies to, make available all such information,
employees and records of or relating to the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries and the Investment Companies as Parent may reasonably
request with respect to matters relating to Taxes (including, without
limitation, the right to make copies of such information and records) and
will cooperate with respect to all matters relating to Taxes (including,
without limitation, the filing of Tax Returns, the filing of amended Tax
Returns, audits, and proceedings).   (c) It is understood and agreed that
Parent and the Company will request that (i) Norman Sinrich, Esq., tax
counsel to Parent (or such other tax counsel to Parent as shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company), and (ii) Day, Berry and Howard LLP and Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen and Katz, legal counsel to the Company, issue to their respective
clients for inclusion as exhibits to the Form S-4 opinions to the effect that
the Merger will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and
respecting related matters (each such opinion, an "Exhibit Opinion" and,
collectively, the "Exhibit Opinions"). In rendering such Exhibit Opinions,
such legal counsel may require and reasonably rely upon reasonably requested
representations contained in certificates of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub (the "Tax Certificates").    39  44   5.16 COMPANY SATISFACTION OF
THE CONDITIONS OF SECTION 15 OF THE 1940 ACT.   (a) The Company shall use,
and shall cause its Subsidiary Boston Advisors ("BA") to use, its best
efforts to cause the boards of trustees of the Company Funds to approve, and
to solicit their respective shareholders as promptly as practicable with
regard to the approval of, new investment advisory agreements with BA acting
as investment adviser for such funds, to be effective on or as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, pursuant to the provisions of Section
15 of the 1940 Act, and consistent with all requirements of the 1940 Act
applicable thereto, provided that such agreements are identical in all
material respects to the existing agreements other than the term of
the agreement. The Company and its Subsidiaries also shall take any similar
action required under the 1940 Act to continue any underwriting or
distribution agreements of the Company Funds. Parent shall have a reasonable
opportunity to review and provide comments on any proxy or other materials
that are proposed to be used by the Company and its Subsidiaries to solicit
the approvals contemplated by this Section 5.16(a), prior to the use of such
materials.   (b) The Company shall use, and shall cause BA to use, its
best efforts to ensure the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 15(f) of the 1940 Act with respect to each of the Company Funds.  
5.17 ADVISORY CONTRACT CONSENTS.   As promptly as practicable, the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall inform, in compliance with applicable law, its
investment advisory services clients (other than those covered by the
foregoing Section 5.16), custodial services clients and mutual fund
distribution services clients of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall request such clients\' written consents to the deemed
assignment of their investment advisory services, custodial services or
mutual fund distribution services agreements, as the case may be, resulting
from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
use their best efforts to obtain such consents or, in the case of agreements
which are not in writing or which either prohibit assignment or a change in
control or state by their terms that they terminate upon assignment or a
change in control, new agreements (and any required director and
investor approvals) with the Company or the appropriate Subsidiary, effective
upon Closing.   5.18 RETENTION PLAN.   Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor, effective as of the Effective Time, the Advest 2000
Retention Plan on terms consistent with those identified in Exhibit B hereto
and the Advest 2000 Management Incentive Plan on terms consistent with those
identified in Exhibit C hereto. The Company shall keep Parent informed in
writing on a timely basis (which shall be not less frequently than bi-weekly)
as to the number of producers who elect to participate in the Advest 2000
Retention Plan. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its producers to become participants in the Advest 2000 Retention
Plan.    40  45   5.19 DIVIDENDS.   The Company shall coordinate with
Parent the declaration, setting of record dates and payment dates of
dividends on shares of Company Common Stock so that holders of shares of
Company Common Stock do not receive dividends on both shares of Company
Common Stock and Parent Common Stock received in the Merger in respect of any
calendar quarter (taking into account that Parent declares and pays dividends

duplication of benefits.   In addition, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under comparable Company Plans

coverage would have been recognized under the applicable Old Plan; and (ii)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively at work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents to the
extent such exclusion or requirement would not have applied under the
applicable Old Plan, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee\'s participation
in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out
of pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.    41  46   5.21 SECTION 16 MATTERS.

contained in this Section 7.5(a) are an integral part of the transactions

which results in a judgment against the Company for the full amount of the
fee set forth in this Section 7.5(a), the Company shall pay to Parent its
costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount of the fee at the rate of 12% per annum

Agreement, dated May 9, 2000, between Parent and the Company (the

for any breach of this Agreement, including, without limitation, attorneys\'
fees and the right to pursue any remedy at law or in equity.   7.6

the Act, I may not sell, transfer or  otherwise dispose of the Parent Common

with Rule 145 promulgated by  the SEC under the Act and all applicable state

obtained by the undersigned  from the staff of the SEC, is otherwise exempt
from registration under  the Act and all applicable state securities or "blue

register  the sale, transfer or other disposition of the Parent Common
Stock  received by me or on my behalf as a result of the Merger under the Act
or  to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an 
exemption from such registration available.   E. I also understand that stop
transfer instructions will be  given to Parent\'s transfer agents with
respect to the Parent Common Stock  and that there will be placed on the
certificates for the Parent Common  Stock issued to me, or any substitutions
therefor, a legend stating in  substance:   "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS
