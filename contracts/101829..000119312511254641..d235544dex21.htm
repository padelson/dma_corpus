-vii-  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of September 21,
2011, by and among United Technologies Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), Charlotte Lucas Corporation, a New York corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Goodrich Corporation, a
New York corporation (the " _Company_ ").

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company each have approved, and in the case of the Company and Merger Sub
deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective shareholders
to consummate, the acquisition of the Company by Parent by means of a merger
of Merger Sub with and into the Company upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding
share of the Company Common Stock (such issued and outstanding shares of the
Company Common Stock, collectively, the " _Shares_ "), other than Shares owned
by Parent, Merger Sub, or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than
Merger Sub) or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, and any shares of
Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company, will be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows: 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement and in accordance with the Business Corporation Law of the
State of New York (the " _NYBCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will be
merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will continue as the
surviving corporation. The Company as the surviving corporation after the
Merger is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Surviving Corporation_."

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m. on the third Business Day after the satisfaction or
waiver of all of the conditions (other than any condition that by its nature
cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to satisfaction or waiver
of any such condition) set forth in _Article VII_ , at the offices of Jones
Day, North Point, 901 Lakeside Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44114, unless another
date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties to this Agreement (the
date of the Closing being the " _Closing Date_ ").

 



-1-  Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. The parties to this Agreement shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") on the Closing Date (or on such other date as
Parent and the Company may agree in writing) with the Department of State of
the State of New York, in such form as required by, and executed in
accordance with, the relevant provisions of the NYBCL (the date and time of
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Department of State of the
State of New York, or such later time as is specified in the Certificate of
Merger and as is agreed to by Parent and the Company in writing, being the "
_Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4 _Effect of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the Section 906 of the NYBCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises and authority of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.5 _Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to
be in the form of (except with respect to the name of the Company) the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Merger Sub, and as so amended
shall be the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law
(and, in each case, subject to _Section 6.7_ hereof).

 

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time will be the
initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and the officers of the Company
immediately before the Effective Time will be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case until their successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of
the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.7 _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary
or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation, its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub vested in
or to be vested in the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute
and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub,
all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do,
in the name and on behalf of each such corporation or otherwise, all such
other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to

 



-2-   vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or
otherwise to carry out this Agreement. 

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of Shares or securities of Parent or Merger Sub:

 

(a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to  _Section 2.1(b)(i)_ and
other than any Shares to be converted into shares of the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)(ii))_) will be cancelled and extinguished and be
converted into the right to receive $127.50 in cash, without interest,
payable to the holder of each Share (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") upon
surrender of either certificates formerly representing such Shares ("
_Certificates_ ") or any book-entry Shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") in the
manner provided in _Section 2.2_. All such Shares, when so converted, will no
longer be outstanding and will be automatically cancelled, retired and cease
to exist. Each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration for such Shares upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share in accordance with _Section 2.2_, without interest.

(b)(i) Each share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned
directly by Parent or Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time will be
cancelled and extinguished, and no payment or other consideration will be made
with respect to such shares.

 

(ii) Each Share held by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company, any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than
Merger Sub) or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such number of
shares of common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation such that the ownership percentage of any such Subsidiary in the
Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time shall equal the
ownership percentage of such Subsidiary in the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will thereafter
represent one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.2 _Payment; Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_.

 



-3-  (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will designate a national bank or
trust company, that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to act as
agent for the holders of Shares in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") to receive the funds necessary to make the payments contemplated
by  _Section 2.1(a)_. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not
later than two Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent or Merger
Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, in trust with the Paying Agent in
a separate account for the benefit of holders of Shares (the " _Payment Fund_
") the aggregate Merger Consideration to which such holders shall be entitled
at the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. If for any reason the
cash in the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the
payment obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent
shall promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal
to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash
payment obligations.

(b)(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in any
event within five Business Days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share
whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (A) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery
will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the
case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the
letter of transmittal, and such letter of transmittal will be in customary
form) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares may thereafter until the first anniversary
of the Effective Time surrender such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the
Paying Agent under cover of the letter of transmittal, as agent for such
holder. Upon delivery of a duly completed and validly executed letter of
transmittal and the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on or
before the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, in
exchange for the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, cash in an amount equal
to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Until so surrendered, Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares (other than Shares held by Parent, Merger Sub, or any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub), direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Merger Sub, and Shares held in the treasury of the
Company) will represent solely the right to receive the aggregate Merger
Consideration relating to the Shares represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares.

(ii) If payment of all or any portion of the Merger Consideration in respect
of cancelled Shares is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name surrendered Certificates are registered, it will be a condition to such
payment that the Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of
such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificates surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that such Tax is not applicable. The Merger Consideration paid
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms
of this _Article II_ will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the Shares theretofore represented by such
Certificates, subject, however, to

 



-4-   the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any
other distributions, in each case with a record date prior to the Effective
Time, that have been declared or made by the Company on such Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, but that have not been paid on
such Shares.

(c) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be
closed and there will not be any further registration of transfers of any
shares of the Companys capital stock thereafter on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to any Shares,
except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Shares held by Parent, Merger
Sub, or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than
Merger Sub), direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Merger Sub, and Shares held in
the treasury of the Company) are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
will be cancelled and exchanged for Merger Consideration as provided in this 
_Article II_. No interest will accrue or be paid on any cash payable upon the
surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares which immediately before the
Effective Time represented the Shares.

 

(d) Promptly following the date which is one year after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any cash, including any interest received with respect to such
cash, and any Certificates or other documents, in its possession relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Transactions_ "),
which had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been
disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or previously
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and thereafter such holders will be
entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws) only as general creditors of the Surviving
Corporation with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due
surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest on
such Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, any other Subsidiary of Parent or the Paying Agent will
be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for Merger
Consideration delivered to a Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from amounts payable under this Agreement, such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law
with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such
withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding were made.

(f) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, may direct as indemnity
against any Action that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the

 



-5-   Paying Agent shall issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares
represented by such Certificates as contemplated by this _Article II_.

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Company Stock Plans_.

 

(a) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the
Company Stock Plans (an " _Option_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised as
of the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall be adjusted and
converted into the right of the holder to receive from the Surviving
Corporation an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock previously subject to such Option and (ii) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock set forth in such Option, less any
required withholding Taxes (the " _Option Cash Payment_ "), and as of the
Effective Time each holder of an Option shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Option Cash Payment. The
Option Cash Payment shall be made promptly (and in any event within 15
Business Days) following the Effective Time.

(b) Each award of a right under any Company Stock Plan (other than awards of
Options, the treatment of which is specified in _Section 2.3(a)_) entitling
the holder thereof to shares of Company Common Stock or cash equal to or based
on the value of Shares (a " _Share Unit_ ") that is outstanding or payable as
of the Effective Time shall be adjusted and converted into the right of the
holder to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to
the product of (i) (A) in the case of Share Units subject to performance-
based vesting conditions, the number of Share Units determined under the
applicable award agreement, and (B) in the case of Share Units subject to
time-based vesting conditions, the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock underlying such Share Units, and (ii) the Merger Consideration, less any
required withholding Taxes (the " _Share Unit Payment_ "). As of the Effective
Time each holder of a Share Unit shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Share Unit Payment. The Share Unit
Payment shall be made promptly (and in any case within 15 Business Days)
following the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _however_ , in the event that
such payment would cause any additional Taxes to be payable pursuant to
Section 409A of the Code with respect to a Share Unit, the payment shall
instead be made at the time specified in the applicable Company Stock Plan
and related award document.

(c) All account balances (whether or not vested) under any Company Plan
(other than a Company Stock Plan) that provides for the deferral of
compensation and represents amounts notionally invested in a number of shares
of Company Common Stock or otherwise provides for distributions or benefits
that are calculated based on the value of a Share (collectively, the "
_Deferred Compensation Plans_ "), shall be adjusted and converted into a right
of the holder to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock previously deemed invested under or
otherwise referenced by such account and (ii) the Merger Consideration, less
any required withholding Taxes (the " _Deferred Payment_ "), and shall 

 



-6-   cease to represent a right to receive a number of shares of Company Common
Stock or cash equal to or based on the value of a number of Shares. The
Deferred Payment shall be made promptly (and in any event within 15 Business
Days) following the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , in the event that
such payment would cause additional Taxes to be payable pursuant to Section
409A of the Code with respect to a Deferred Payment, the Deferred Payment
shall instead be made at the time specified in the applicable Deferred
Compensation Plan and related plan documents.

(d) With respect to the Companys 2008 Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the " _ESPP_ "), (i) no new offering period shall commence after the date of
this Agreement and, to the extent not already provided for under the terms of
the ESPP as of the date of this Agreement, no employees shall be permitted to
begin participating in the ESPP, and no participants shall be permitted to
increase elective deferrals in respect of the current offering period under
the ESPP, in each case after the date of this Agreement; (ii) any offering
period under the ESPP that is in effect immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement shall terminate at the closing of the offering period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, and amounts credited to the
accounts of participants shall be used to purchase Shares in accordance with
the terms of the ESPP; and (iii) such Shares shall be treated as other
outstanding Shares in accordance with _Section 2.1_. For the avoidance of
doubt, each fractional Share held by any participant under the ESPP will be
cancelled and extinguished at the Effective Time, and be converted into
the right to receive a commensurate fractional portion of the Merger
Consideration in cash, without interest, payable to the holder of each such
fractional Share.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such lawful action
as may be necessary (which include satisfying the requirements of Rule
16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act), without incurring any liability
in connection therewith, to provide for and give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 2.3_.

Section 2.4 _No Appraisal Rights_. In accordance with Section 910 of the
NYBCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of Shares in
connection with the Merger.

 

Section 2.5 _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of capital stock, of the Company shall occur as a
result of any merger, business combination,
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide
Parent and the holders of Shares the same economic benefit as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section
2.5_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect
to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

being conducted, except, with respect to the Companys Subsidiaries that are
not Significant Subsidiaries (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the

the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), and including similar collaboration,
participation or off-set arrangements or obligations, where the result,
purpose or effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in the Company SEC Documents or the Company Financial
Statements, or (ii) any Contract relating to any transaction or relationship
with, or ownership or other economic interest in, any variable interest
entity.

under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX and the rules and

(e) The Company has designed and maintains a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting. The Company (i) has designed and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance that all
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and

required disclosure, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the Companys
outside auditors and the Audit Committee of the Company Board (A) all

adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting, all of which information
described in clauses (A) and (B) above has been disclosed by the Company to
Parent prior to the date hereof. Since December 31, 2008, any material change
in internal control over financial reporting required to be disclosed in any
Company SEC Document has been so disclosed.

 

(f) Since December 31, 2008 through the date of this Agreement, to the
Knowledge of the Company (i) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise obtained
knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim,
whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

December 31, 2008, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, has reported to the Company Board or any committee
thereof or to any director or officer of the Company any evidence of a
material violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation, relating to periods after December 31, 2008, by the Company or any
of its officers, directors, employees or agents.

the date of this Agreement, (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their respective businesses only in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice and (b) there has not been (i) any event,
circumstance, change, occurrence, state of facts or effect (including the
incurrence of any liabilities of any nature, whether or not accrued,
contingent or otherwise) that has had or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) to the
Knowledge of the Company, any action taken by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that, if taken during the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Effective Time, would constitute a breach of clause (v), (vi),
(vii), (viii), (ix) or (xii) of _Section 5.1_.

Section 3.7 _No Undisclosed Material Liabilities_. There are no liabilities
or obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether accrued,

SEC under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, and publicly available,
after January 1, 2011 and prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding any
forward-looking statements, risk factors and other similar statements in such
forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents that are
cautionary, nonspecific or predictive in nature), Parent and Merger Sub,
jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has all requisite
corporate or other organizational power and authority and all necessary
governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry
on its business as now being conducted, except where the failure to be so
organized, existing and in good standing or to have such power, authority and
governmental approvals has not had and would not have or reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect
on the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions. Parent owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
the Merger Sub.

as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, and no other corporate action on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery
and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming due and valid authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, is a valid and
binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against each
of them in accordance with its terms, except that such enforcement may be
subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or
other similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally and general
principles of equitable relief. No vote or approval of the stockholders of
Parent is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance
by Parent and Merger Sub of their obligations hereunder or for the
consummation of the Merger (including pursuant to the requirements of the New
York Stock Exchange).

filings, declarations or registrations with, any Governmental Entity are
necessary for the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions,
other than such other consents, approvals, filings, declarations or
registrations that, if not obtained, made or given, would not have or
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger and the other Transactions.

the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the Transactions, and compliance

required by, or result in the creation of any Encumbrance upon any of the
respective properties or assets of either Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their respective Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any Contract binding upon either Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, or by which they or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound or affected, or any license, franchise,
permit or other authorization held by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for such violations,

of its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) is, and at no time during the last
five years has Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) been,
an "interested shareholder" of the Company as defined in Section 912 of

holding, voting or disposing of, any shares of capital stock of the Company
(other than as contemplated by this Agreement).

Agreement, the Financing Commitment has not been amended or otherwise
modified in any respect. As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of

delay Parent or Merger Sub from performing its obligations under this
Agreement.

are traded, in order for Parent to consummate the Merger.

or any other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time from and after the
date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Shareholder Approval, the
Company or any of its Representatives receives a bona fide, unsolicited
written Company Takeover Proposal from any Person, under circumstances not
involving any breach of this _Section 5.2_, if the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, then the
Company may, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, (x) furnish,
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including
non-public information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the Person who has made such Company Takeover Proposal;  _provided_ , that
the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) provide to
Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such access which was
not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives and (y) engage in or
otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making
such Company Takeover Proposal regarding such Company Takeover Proposal. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means
any customary confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no

Agreement (including standstill restrictions).

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after
receipt) notify (which notice shall be provided orally and in writing and
shall identify the Person making the Company Takeover Proposal and set forth
the material terms thereof) Parent after receipt of any Company Takeover
Proposal, and shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after
receipt) provide copies to Parent of any proposals, indications of interest,
and/or draft agreements relating to such Company Takeover Proposal. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of
any material developments, discussion or negotiations regarding any Company
Takeover Proposal (including by promptly (and in no event

 



-31-   later than 24 hours after receipt) providing to Parent copies of any
additional or revised proposals, indications of interest, and/or draft
agreements relating to such Company Takeover Proposal) on a prompt basis (and
in any event within 24 hours) and upon the request of Parent shall apprise
Parent of the status of such Company Takeover Proposal. The Company agrees
that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with
any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from
providing any information to Parent in accordance with this _Section 5.2_.

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.2(d)_ or, in the case of
the following subclauses (i)(A) and (i)(B) only, _Section 5.2(e)_, the
Company Board shall not (i) (A) fail to include the Company Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or
authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (C) take
any formal action or make any recommendation or public statement in connection
with a tender offer or exchange offer (other than a recommendation against
such offer or a customary "stop, look and listen" communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, in each case that
includes a reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation) (it being understood
that the Company Board may refrain from taking a position with respect to
such a tender offer or exchange offer until the close of business as of the
tenth Business Day after the commencement of such tender offer or exchange
offer pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act without such action
being considered a Company Adverse Recommendation Change) or (D) adopt,
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend to
shareholders of the Company a Company Takeover Proposal (any action described
in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation
Change_ "), or (ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent or similar
document, agreement, commitment or agreement in principle with respect to any
Company Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
entered into in accordance with _Section 5.2(b)_) or (iii) terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to the time the Shareholder
Approval is obtained, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)_, if, after receiving a bona fide, unsolicited Company Takeover
Proposal, the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (x) in
light of such Company Takeover Proposal, the failure to so make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or to so terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)_, respectively, would reasonably be likely to be a violation
of the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under
applicable Law, and (y) such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, prior to making such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8.1(c)_, (1) the Company has given Parent at least five calendar
days prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice
shall include an unredacted copy of the Company Superior Proposal, an
unredacted copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements and an
unredacted copy of any financing commitments (including Redacted Fee Letters)
relating thereto and a written summary of the material terms of any Company
Superior Proposal not made in writing, including with respect to any financing
commitments (including Redacted Fee Letters) relating thereto), (2) the
Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in
good faith with Parent during such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes
to

 



-32-   negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement such that it would cause such Company Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Company Superior Proposal, (3) following the end of such notice
period, the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any revisions to
the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have
determined, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that the Company Superior Proposal would nevertheless
continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed
were to be given effect, and (4) in the event of each and every change to any
of the financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of
consideration) or any other material terms of such Company Superior Proposal,
the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an additional
notice consistent with that described in clause (1) above of this proviso and
a new notice period under clause (1) of this proviso shall commence (except
that the five calendar day period notice period referred to in clause (1)
above of this proviso shall instead be equal to the longer of (I) three
Business Days and (II) the period remaining under the notice period under
clause (1) of this proviso immediately prior to the delivery of such
additional notice under this clause (4)) during which time the Company shall
be required to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.2(d)_ anew
with respect to such additional notice, including clauses (1) through (4)
above of this proviso; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company has
complied in all material respect with its obligations under this _Section
5.2_; and _provided_ , _further_ , that any purported termination of this
Agreement pursuant to this sentence shall be void and of no force and effect,
unless the Company termination is in accordance with _Section 8.1_ and, as a
condition precedent to any such Company termination, the Company shall have
paid Parent the applicable Termination Fee in accordance with _Section
8.2(b)_ prior to or concurrently with such termination.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the time the
Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may change, qualify,
withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or publicly propose to change,
qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation (" _Change of Recommendation_ "), if, in response to
an Intervening Event, the Company Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that failure to make such Change of Recommendation would reasonably be likely
to be a violation of the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the Companys
shareholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that such action
shall not be in response to a Company Takeover Proposal or a Company Superior
Proposal (which is addressed under _Section 5.2(d)_) and prior to taking
such action, (i) the Company Board has given Parent at least five calendar
days prior written notice of its intention to make such Change of
Recommendation and a reasonable description of the Intervening Event that
serves as the basis of such Change of Recommendation, (ii) the Company has
negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith
with Parent during such notice period after giving any such notice, to the
extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to
the terms of this Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need for
making such Change of Recommendation, (iii) at the end of such notice period,
the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the
terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to make a Change
of Recommendation would nevertheless reasonably be likely to be a violation of
the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under
applicable Law if the revisions proposed were to be given effect and (iv) in
the event of each and every change to the material facts and circumstances

 



-33-   relating to such Intervening Event, the Company shall, in each case, have
delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in
clause (i) above of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (i) of
this proviso shall commence (except that the five calendar day period notice
period referred to in clause (i) above of this proviso shall instead be equal
to the longer of (x) three Business Days and (y) the period remaining under
the notice period under clause (i) of this proviso immediately prior to the
delivery of such additional notice under this clause (iv)) during which time
the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of this
_Section 5.2(e)_ anew with respect to such additional notice, including
clauses (i) through (iv) above of this proviso.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ or in _Section 6.6_ shall
prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to its
shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any other similar disclosure
to the Companys shareholders if, in the Company Boards determination in good
faith after consultation with outside counsel, the failure so to disclose
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders
under applicable Law or its obligations under applicable federal securities
Law; _provided_ , that any such position or disclosure (other than a
customary "stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, in each case that includes a
reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation) shall be deemed to be a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly and
concurrently reaffirms the Company Recommendation.

ARTICLE VI

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 6.1 _Preparation of Proxy Statement_.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall file with the SEC the Proxy Statement. The Company will use
reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the
holders of the Shares, as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities Laws. Subject to _Section 5.2(d)_ and _Section 5.2(e)_, the Proxy
Statement will contain the Company Recommendation and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Shareholder Approval.

(b) Parent and Merger Sub will provide for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement all reasonably required information relating
to Parent or its Affiliates. Parent and its counsel shall be given the
opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement before it is filed
with the SEC, and the Company will use it reasonable efforts to incorporate
any such comments of Parent and/or its counsel prior to such filing. In
addition, the Company will provide Parent and its counsel, in writing, any
comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that the Company or
its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after the receipt of such comments or
other communications, and the opportunity to review and comment on such
comments. The Company will respond promptly to any such comments from the SEC
or its

 



-34-   staff, and will use it reasonable efforts to incorporate any reasonable
comments of Parent and/or its counsel prior to such response.

 

(c) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees to promptly (i) correct
any information provided by it specifically for use in the Proxy Statement if
and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect and (ii) supplement the information provided by it
specifically for use in the Proxy Statement to include any information that
shall become necessary in order to make the statements in the Proxy Statement,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
Company further agrees to cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected
or supplemented promptly to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
the holders of the Shares (and will use it reasonable efforts to incorporate
any reasonable comments of Parent and/or its counsel prior to such filing and
dissemination), in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities Laws.

Section 6.2 _Shareholders Meeting_. 

(a) The Company shall take all actions in accordance with applicable Law, its
constituent documents and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange to duly
call, set a record date for, give notice of, convene and hold a special
meeting of the Companys shareholders (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the " _Special Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable
for the purpose of considering and taking action upon the adoption of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company shall not adjourn or postpone the Special Meeting
without Parents consent; _provided_ that without Parents consent, the
Company may adjourn or postpone the Special Meeting (i) after consultation
with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the shareholders of the
Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Special Meeting
or (ii) if as of the time for which the Special Meeting is originally
scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares
of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Special Meeting.
Notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Change in
Recommendation, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance
with its terms, the Company shall (x) submit this Agreement to the
shareholders of the Company as promptly as practicable for the purpose
of obtaining the Shareholder Approval at the Special Meeting and (y) not
submit any Company Takeover Proposal for approval by the shareholders of the
Company.

(b) At the Special Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof, Parent
shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then beneficially owned by
it, Merger Sub or any of its other Subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

Section 6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. 

 



-35-  (a) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under any applicable Laws to consummate and make effective in the
most expeditious manner possible the Transactions including (i) the
preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to be
filed to consummate the Transactions, (ii) the satisfaction of the other
parties conditions to consummating the Transactions, (iii) taking all
reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and cooperation with each other in
obtaining) any consent, authorization, Order or approval of, or any exemption
by, any third party, including any Governmental Entity (which actions shall
include furnishing all information required under the HSR Act and in
connection with approvals of or filings with any Governmental Entity
responsible for or having jurisdiction over antitrust, competition, trade
regulation, foreign investment and/or national security or defense matters)
required to be obtained or made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions or the
taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) the execution
and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.
Additionally, each of Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable best
efforts to fulfill all conditions precedent to the Merger and shall not take
any action after the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected
to materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining,
any permission, approval or consent from any such Governmental Entity
necessary to be obtained prior to Closing.

(b) Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status
of matters relating to the completion of the Transactions and work
cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required consents,
authorizations, Orders or approvals of, or any exemptions by, any
Governmental Entity, including by working cooperatively in connection with any
sales, divestitures or dispositions of assets or businesses if and to the
extent undertaken pursuant to the provisions of this  _Section 6.3_. In that
regard, prior to the Closing, each party shall promptly consult with the other
parties to this Agreement with respect to, provide any necessary information
with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other
parties (or their counsel) copies of), all filings made by such party with any
Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such party to, or
correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions. Each party to this Agreement shall promptly
inform the other parties to this Agreement, and if in writing, furnish the
other party with copies of (or, in the case of material oral communications,
advise the other party orally of) any communication from any Governmental
Entity regarding any of the Transactions, and permit the other party to review
and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other
party in connection with, any proposed written (or any material proposed
oral) communication with any such Governmental Entity. If any party to this
Agreement or any Representative of such parties receives a request for
additional information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Transactions, then such party will use reasonable best
efforts to make, or cause to be made, promptly and after consultation with the
other parties to this Agreement, an appropriate response in compliance with
such request. Neither party shall participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions (or
make oral submissions at meetings or in telephone or other conversations)
unless it consults with the other party in advance and to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity gives the other party the opportunity to
attend and participate thereat. Each party shall furnish the other party with
copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between it and any such

 



-36-   Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement and the Merger, and
furnish the other party with such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of necessary filings or submissions of information to any such
Governmental Entity. Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this Section as "outside counsel/corporate in-house
antitrust counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to the outside legal counsel and corporate in-house
antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel and corporate in-house antitrust counsel to employees (other than
corporate in-house antitrust counsel), officers, or directors of the recipient
unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the
materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel;
_provided_ , _however_ , that materials provided pursuant to this _Section
6.3(b)_ may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of
the Company and the Merger, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns.
To the extent that transfers of any permits issued by any Governmental Entity
are required as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions, the parties hereto shall use reasonable best
efforts to effect such transfers.

 

(c) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as
promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than fifteen Business Days
after the date of this Agreement, notifications under the HSR Act, and the
Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as promptly as
practicable, any other filings and/or notifications under applicable
Antitrust Laws. In the event that the parties receive a request for
information or documentary materials following the HSR Act filing (a " _Second
Request_ ") and/or the Transactions are subject to "Second Phase" review
following any filing, notice, petition, statement, registration, submission
of information, application or similar filing required by any other Antitrust
Law or by any Governmental Entity responsible for or having jurisdiction over
antitrust, competition, trade regulation, foreign investment and/or national
security or defense matters (a " _Second Phase Information Request_ "), the
parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond to such
Second Request and/or Second Phase Information Request, as applicable, as
promptly as possible or as otherwise instructed by Parent pursuant to _Section
6.3(f)_ and counsel for both parties will closely cooperate during the
entirety of any such Second Request review process and/or Second Phase
Information Request process, as the case may be.

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Transactions under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as
amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, and any other United States federal or state or foreign or
supranational Laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or
that provide for review of foreign investment and/or national security or
defense matters (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "). In connection therewith,
if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any
of the Transactions as violative of any Antitrust Laws, each of Parent and
the Company shall cooperate and use all reasonable best efforts to vigorously
contest and resist any such Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or
restricts consummation of the Merger or any other Transactions, including 

 



-37-   by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial
appeal. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing in this  _Section 6.3(d)_ shall limit the right of any
party hereto to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or
_Section 8.1(b)(ii)_, so long as such party hereto has, up to the time
of termination, complied in all material respects with its obligations under
this _Section 6.3(d)_. Each of Parent and the Company shall use all
reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the
expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws
with respect to the Transactions as promptly as possible after the execution
of this Agreement.

(e) The parties shall take all actions necessary to avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment under any Antitrust Laws so as to enable the Closing to
occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the
Outside Date), including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of such businesses, product lines or assets of the
Company, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries and (ii) otherwise taking or
committing to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit Parents or
its Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability
to retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of the
Company, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries, in each case as may be
required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
preliminary or permanent injunction, in any Action under any Antitrust Laws,
which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing, and in that
regard Parent and, if requested by Parent, the Company shall (but if not so
requested by Parent shall not) agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold
separate, or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its
freedom of action with respect to, or Parents, the Companys or their
respective Subsidiaries ability to retain, any of the businesses, product
lines or assets of the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such action shall be
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger, and notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent shall not be required to
take, or agree or commit to take, any such action, or agree or commit to, or
effect, any such other matter, described in clauses (i) or (ii) above that, in
the reasonable judgment of Parent, would constitute or reasonably be expected
to result in the sale, divestiture or disposal of, or the holding separate of
or direct or indirect operational or ownership restrictions on, businesses,
product lines or assets of the Company, Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries having or generating revenues (including for both Parent and its
Subsidiaries and the Company and its Subsidiaries) for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2010 in excess of $900 million in the aggregate (an "
_Unacceptable Condition_ "), for the sake of clarity, it being understood that
any revenues of the Company from the Aero Engine Controls joint venture, as
constituted on the date hereof, shall be excluded for purposes of this
calculation if the Companys interest in such joint venture is sold pursuant
to a contractual obligation of the Company existing as of the date hereof.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties
agree that it is Parents sole right to devise the strategy for all filings,
notifications, submissions and communications in connection with any filing,
notice, petition, statement, registration, submission of information,
application or similar filing subject to this Section 6.3.

 

Section 6.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Subject to applicable Law, the
Company shall give prompt notice to Merger Sub and Parent, and Merger Sub and
Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company

 



-38-   of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event whose occurrence or
non-occurrence would be reasonably likely to cause either (i) any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or in the Company
Disclosure Letter to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any
time from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time or (ii) any
condition to the Merger to be unsatisfied in any material respect at the
Effective Time and (b) any material failure of the Company, Merger Sub or
Parent, as the case may be, or any officer, director, employee, agent or
representative of the Company, Merger Sub or Parent as applicable, to comply
with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available under this Agreement to the party receiving such notice.
The Company and Parent shall each promptly notify the other of any written
notice from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be
required in connection with the Transactions. The Company and Parent shall
each promptly notify the other of any Actions commenced or, to its Knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the consummation of the
Transactions.

Section 6.5 _Access; Confidentiality_. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Law relating to the sharing of
information, the Company agrees to (a) provide, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to provide, Parent and its Representatives, from the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement, reasonable access during normal business hours to (i) the Companys
and its Subsidiaries respective properties, books, Contracts, commitments,
personnel and records and (ii) such other information as Parent shall
reasonably request with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective businesses, financial condition and operations; and (b) request its
and its Subsidiaries respective Representatives to cooperate with Parent
with respect to the foregoing; _provided_ that nothing in this Agreement shall
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose any information to
Parent or its Representatives that would cause a violation of any material
Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, would
cause a risk of a loss of privilege to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or would constitute a violation of applicable Laws;  _provided_ , further
that (x) no investigation of the Companys business shall affect any
representation or warranty given by the Company hereunder, in the Company
Disclosure Letter or in the certificate referenced in  _Section 7.2(c)_, or
otherwise limit or affect the remedies available under this Agreement to
Parent and (y) competitively sensitive material (reasonably designated by the
Company as such) may be provided in accordance with the procedures set forth
in _Section 6.3(b)_. Parent shall and shall cause Parents controlled
Affiliates and Representatives to keep confidential any non-public information
received from the Company, its Affiliates or Representatives, directly or
indirectly, pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.6 _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the Merger
shall be a joint press release, to be agreed upon by Parent and the Company.
Thereafter, neither the Company, Parent nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
announcement with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions without the
prior consent of the other party (or without giving such other party the
opportunity to review and comment on such press release or other
announcement), except as such party reasonably believes, after receiving the
advice of outside counsel and after informing the other party, is required by
Law or by any listing agreement with

 



-39-   or rules of any applicable national securities exchange, trading market or
listing authority, in which event, such party shall endeavor, on a basis
reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to
the other party to review and comment upon such press release or other
announcement.

 

Section 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent
permitted under the NYBCL, honor the Companys obligations existing
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement to indemnify and hold harmless
each present and former director and officer of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and each such individual who served at the request of the
Company or its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, trustee, partner,
fiduciary, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise other
than the Company or a Subsidiary thereof (collectively, the " _Indemnified
Parties_ "), in accordance with the terms of the Companys Restated
Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and all indemnification agreements
with Indemnified Parties, in each case in effect immediately prior to the date
hereof.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase a six-year "tail"
prepaid officers and directors liability insurance policy, providing, for a
period of six years after the Effective Time, the Companys current and
former directors and officers (as defined to mean those persons insured under
the Companys existing officers and directors liability insurance policy)
with insurance and indemnification policy coverage for events occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is no less
favorable than the existing policy (including that such purchase does not
result in any gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall
not pay an aggregate amount for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300 percent of
the current aggregate annual premium paid by the Company for the existing
policy, but in such case shall purchase such coverage under a six-year "tail"
prepaid policy as shall then be available at an aggregate cost no greater than
300 percent of such rate). From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
continue to honor its obligations under the DandO Insurance and shall not
cancel nor take any action or omit to take any action that would result in the
cancellation thereof.

(c) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification set forth in the
Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company, which
provisions shall not be amended, modified or otherwise repealed for a period
of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder as of the Effective Time of any individual who at the
Effective Time is an Indemnified Party, unless such modification is required
after the Effective Time by Law and then only to the minimum extent required
by such Law.

 

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this _Section 6.7_ shall be in
addition to any rights such individual may have under the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws (or other governing documents) of the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries, under the NYBCL or any other applicable
Laws or under any agreement of any Indemnified Party with 

 



-40-   the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive
consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party.

 

(e) In the event that the Parent or Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

Section 6.8 _Merger Sub Compliance_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply
with all of its obligations under or related to this Agreement.

 

Section 6.9 _Employee Matters_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall honor all Company Plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the date of
this Agreement (or as amended as contemplated or permitted hereby or with the
prior written consent of Parent). For a period of one year following the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each
current employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who is not subject to a
collective bargaining agreement (the " _Company Employees_ "), for so long as
such employee remains employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries, compensation
and benefits (excluding equity compensation) which, in the aggregate, are
substantially equivalent to the compensation and benefits (excluding equity
compensation), in the aggregate, provided to such Company
Employee immediately before the Effective Time; provided that the foregoing
obligation may be satisfied through participation and coverage following the
Effective Time in Parents or its Subsidiaries (as applicable) compensation
and benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements as in effect from time
to time, it being understood that the Company Employees may commence
participating in the plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries on different dates
following the Effective Time with respect to different plans of Parent and
its Subsidiaries. For a period of one year following the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each current employee
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than those who are party to a
Management Continuity Agreement, whose rights shall be governed by the terms
of such agreements, and those who are covered by a collective bargaining
agreement, whose rights shall be governed by the applicable bargaining
agreement) who following the Effective Time suffers a qualifying termination
of employment under the terms and conditions of the severance arrangement of
the Company and its Subsidiaries applicable to such employee as in effect on
the date hereof (taking into account such Company Employees service as
required pursuant to _Section 6.9(b)_ below), and thereafter, Company
Employees shall be eligible for severance benefits under the severance
arrangements applicable to similarly situated employees of Parent or its
Subsidiaries as they may maintain such plans from time to time.

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and benefit accrual
(other than for purposes of benefit accruals under any pension plan sponsored
by Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries))
under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing
benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective

 



-41-   Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with his
or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries or predecessors
before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was
entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
similar employee benefit plan or the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such
Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Effective Time (and to the extent there is not a similar employee
benefit plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries, service as recognized for
purposes of the Companys 401(k) Plan); provided that the foregoing shall not
apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits or where prior service is not credited for similarly situated
employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries or with respect to frozen
or grandfathered plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
and all New Plans that are welfare benefit plans to the extent coverage under
such New Plan is comparable to a Company Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately before the consummation of the Transactions (such
plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") other than limitations or waiting
periods that would have been in effect with respect to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been
waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which
such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and Parent
shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending
on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins
to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation, and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates,
as applicable, will take all actions necessary to effectuate the provisions of
Section 6.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such action
necessary (if any) to ensure that no "rabbi" or similar trust maintained by
the Company or its Subsidiaries is required to be funded as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Nothing in this _Section 6.9_ shall (i) be treated as an amendment of,
or undertaking to amend, any benefit plan or (ii) prohibit Parent or any of
its Affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation, from amending or
terminating any employee benefit plan. The provisions of this _Section 6.9_
are solely for the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and
nothing in this _Section 6.9_, express or implied, shall confer upon any

Days prior to the Effective Time, and all related contracts to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and (y) cause to be released any
Encumbrances on its assets relating to such terminated credit facilities.

fulfilling its obligations pursuant to this  _Section 6.11_, (i) none of the

material breach; and (ii) this  _Section 8.2_, _Article IX_, _Article X_,
the provisions of the last sentence of _Section 6.5_, and the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive such termination. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _ _willful and material breach__ " shall mean a material
breach that is a consequence of an act undertaken by the breaching party with
the knowledge that the taking of such act would, or would reasonably be
expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to the provisions

(x) prior to such termination a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been
publicly announced or shall have become publicly known (or, in the case of a
termination pursuant to the provisions of _Section 8.1(b)(i)_, otherwise
made known to the Company Board) and shall not have been withdrawn and (y) at
any time on or prior to the twelve month anniversary of such termination the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to any Company Takeover Proposal or the transactions contemplated by
any Company Takeover Proposal are consummated (provided that solely for
purposes of this  _Section 8.2(b)(iv)(y)_, the term "Company Takeover
Proposal" shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of Company
Takeover Proposal except that all references to 20% shall be deemed references
to 40%), the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Termination
Fee shall become due and payable in accordance with this _Section 8.2(b)_,

to and in accordance with this _Section 8.2(b)_ (and any amounts payable
under _Section 8.2(d)_), the Company shall have no further liability of any
kind for any reason in connection with this Agreement or the termination
contemplated hereby other than as provided under this _Section 8.2(b)_,
except in the case of a willful and material breach by the Company of this
Agreement. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the Termination Fee
is not a penalty, but rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount
that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, in the
circumstances in which such Termination Fee is due and payable, for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision. In no event shall Parent be entitled to the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(c) If Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_,
then the Company shall reimburse Parent, up to an aggregate of $50 million,
for all of the documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by Parent
or its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated herein, including (i) all fees and expenses of accountants,
counsel, investment banking firms or financial advisors (and their respective
counsel and representatives), experts and consultants to Parent or any of its
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and (ii) all fees and expenses payable to banks, investment banking
firms and other financial institutions (and their respective counsel and
representatives) in connection with arranging or providing financing for the
Merger Consideration or any of the other Transactions, and costs and expenses
otherwise allocated to Parent pursuant to _Section 9.3_.

(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in  _Section
8.2(b)_ and _Section 8.2(c)_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and
that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the 

 



-49-   Company fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to _Section
8.2(b)_ or _Section 8.2(c)_, then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent for
all costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of
counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amount, including in
connection with any related Actions commenced by or against Parent and (ii)
the Company shall pay to Parent interest on such amount from and including
the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding the date of actual
payment at the prime rate set forth in the _Wall Street Journal_ in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made plus 2%.
