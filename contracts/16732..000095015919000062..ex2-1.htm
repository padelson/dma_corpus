RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, (i) the Seller is the direct owner of one hundred percent (100%) of

capital stock, the " _Purchased Shares_ "), and (ii) the Company is the owner,
directly or indirectly, of one  hundred percent (100%) of the equity

").

 

WHEREAS, the Seller wishes to sell to Buyer, and Buyer wishes to purchase from
the Seller, all of the  Purchased Shares, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and  inducement to the Seller's willingness to enter into this
Agreement, the Equity Financing Sources, (collectively, the " _Guarantors_ ")
are each entering into  limited guarantees, dated as of the date hereof, in
favor of the Seller (collectively, the " _Limited Guarantees_ ") with respect
to certain obligations of Buyer  under this Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants,
representations, warranties  and agreements hereinafter set forth and
intending to be legally bound, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

Section 2.01 _Purchase and Sale of Purchased  Shares_. On the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, the
Seller shall sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver, as legal and
beneficial owner, to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase, acquire  and accept
from the Seller, free and clear of all Liens (other than any transfer
restrictions arising under applicable securities Laws), all right, title and
interest in and to the Purchased Shares.

 


 

     


 

 

Section 2.02 _Closing_. The closing of  the sale and purchase of the
Purchased Shares (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. New York
time at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP,  767 Fifth Avenue, New
York, New York 10153, or such other place as the Seller and Buyer may agree in
writing, on the last day of Parent's fiscal month immediately following the
date on which the conditions set forth in Section 9.01, Section 9.02, and
Section 9.03 have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that
by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time) (such day, " _Parent
's Fiscal Month End_", and the date on which the Closing takes place being the
" _Closing    Date_ "); provided, however,  that notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall the Closing occur prior to the date that is 60
days after the date of this Agreement without Buyer's prior written consent
(which written consent can be delivered by Buyer in its sole  discretion);
provided, further, that, subject to the 60-day requirement in the immediately
preceding proviso and the satisfaction or waiver of  the conditions set forth
in Section 9.01, Section 9.02 and Section 9.03, the Seller may, following no
less than five (5) Business Days prior written notice to Buyer, determine that
the Closing Date shall be a Business Day  earlier than Parent's Fiscal Month
End.

 

Section 2.03 _Purchase Price_. The  aggregate " _Purchase Price_ " for the
Purchased Shares shall be an amount in cash equal to $510,000,000 (the " _Base
Payment_ "), which amount shall be adjusted as a result of the Closing
Adjustment, if any, pursuant to Section 2.04  (the " _Closing Payment_ "),
and the Post-Closing Adjustment, if any, pursuant to Section   2.07. The
Closing Payment shall be paid to an account or accounts designated by Parent
in the Closing Notice.

 

Section 2.04 _Closing Adjustment_. Not  less than three (3) Business Days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Parent shall provide Buyer with a
notice (the " _Closing Notice_ ") that includes the  following:

 

(a) a " _Statement of Estimated Working Capital_ ",  prepared in accordance
with the Transaction Accounting Principles and in the format of the Reference
Working Capital Statement set forth on _Exhibit B_ ,  setting forth the
estimated Working Capital of the Company as of the Closing (" _Estimated
Working Capital_ ");

 

(b) Parent's good faith determination of the " _Closing  Adjustment_ "
prepared in accordance with the Transaction Accounting Principles, which shall
equal (i) the amount of estimated Closing Date Cash, minus (ii) the amount of
estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, (iii) (A) if the Estimated  Working
Capital Adjustment is positive, _plus_ the Estimated Working Capital
Adjustment or (B) if the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment is negative,
_minus_ , the absolute value of the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment,
minus (iv) the amount of estimated Unpaid Transaction Expenses;

 

(c) taking into account the Closing Adjustment, the estimated Purchase Price
at Closing (the " _Estimated Purchase Price_ "); and

 

(d) the account or accounts to which Buyer shall pay the Closing Payment.

 

Buyer shall have two (2) Business Days from the receipt of the Closing Notice
to provide Parent any comments with  respect to the Closing Notice and Parent
shall consider (in good faith) any appropriate changes thereto prior to the
Closing. If the Closing Adjustment is a positive amount, then the Purchase
Price paid by Buyer as directed by Parent in the  Closing Notice shall be
increased by the Closing Adjustment. If the Closing Adjustment is a negative
amount, then the Purchase Price paid by Buyer as directed by Parent shall be
decreased by the absolute value of the Closing Adjustment.

Section 2.05 _Closing Deliveries by the Seller_.     At the Closing, the
Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer:

 

(a) a certificate of a duly authorized officer of the Seller certifying as to
the matters set forth in Section 9.03(a);

 

(b) a certificate of non-foreign status that complies with Section 1445 of the
Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b)(2), duly  executed by the
Seller; and

 

(c) the resignation letters (or evidence of removal) required by Section 6.11.

 

Section 2.06 _Closing Deliveries by Buyer_.   At the Closing, Buyer shall
deliver to the Seller:

 

(a) the Closing Payment, by wire transfer in immediately available funds, to
an account or accounts as directed by the Seller in the  Closing Notice; and

 

(b) a certificate of a duly authorized officer of Buyer certifying as to the
matters set forth in Section 9.02(a).

 

Section 2.07 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Seller, or  any other
Affiliate of Parent as designated by Parent, a statement (the " _Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth Buyer's calculation of (i) the Closing Date
Cash,  (ii) the Closing Date Indebtedness, (iii) the Closing Date Working
Capital, (iv) the Unpaid Transaction Expenses and (v) the " _Final Purchase
Price_ ", which  shall equal (A) the Base Payment, _plus_ (B) the amount of
the Closing Date Cash, _minus_ (C) the amount of the Closing Date
Indebtedness, and (D)(1) if the Closing Date Working Capital Adjustment is
positive, _plus_ ,  the Closing Date Working Capital Adjustment or (2) if the
Closing Date Working Capital Adjustment is negative, _minus_ , the absolute
value of the Closing Date  Working Capital Adjustment, _minus_ (E) the Unpaid
Transaction Expenses (collectively, (B) through (E), the " _Post-Closing
Adjustment_ "). Buyer's calculations set forth in the Closing Statement
(collectively, the " _Proposed Purchase  Price Calculations_ ") shall be
delivered with reasonable supporting detail with respect to the calculation of
such amounts.

 

(b) Within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the Closing Statement, Parent
may provide written notice to Buyer disputing all or a part of  the Proposed
Purchase Price Calculations (such notice, a " _Purchase Price Dispute Notice_
"). If Parent does not provide a Purchase Price Dispute Notice to  Buyer
within such 45-day period, then the parties agree that the Proposed Purchase
Price Calculations set forth in the Closing Statement shall be deemed final
and binding on the parties hereto. Any Purchase Price Dispute Notice shall set
forth in

reasonable detail the basis for such disagreement, the amounts involved and
Parent's determination (in each  case, with reasonable supporting detail) of
the (i) the Closing Date Cash, (ii) the Closing Date Indebtedness, (iii) the
Closing Date Working Capital and (iv) the Unpaid Transaction Expenses. If a
Purchase Price Dispute Notice is provided to  Buyer, then Buyer and Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the disputed items (the "
_Disputed Items_ ") during the thirty  (30)-day period commencing on the date
of Buyer's receipt of the Purchase Price Dispute Notice.

 

(c) If Parent and Buyer do not agree upon a final resolution with respect to
any Disputed Items within such 30-day period, then the  remaining items in
dispute shall be submitted immediately to a mutually agreeable accounting firm
to be determined by Parent and Buyer or, if such firm declines to be retained
to resolve the dispute, another nationally recognized, independent 
accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Parent (in either case, the
" _Accounting Firm_ "). The Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as
an  arbitrator and shall make any determinations based solely on the written
submissions of Buyer, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, and not
by independent investigation. The parties agree to instruct the Accounting
Firm to render a  determination of the applicable dispute within forty-five
(45) days after referral of the matter to such Accounting Firm, which
determination must be in writing and must set forth, in reasonable detail, the
basis therefor. The terms of appointment  and engagement of the Accounting
Firm shall be as agreed upon between Parent and Buyer, and any associated
engagement fees shall be initially borne fifty percent (50%) by Parent and
fifty percent (50%) by Buyer; _provided_ that such fees shall ultimately be
borne by Parent and Buyer in inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters
resolved by the Accounting Firm, which proportionate  allocations shall also
be determined by the Accounting Firm at the time the determination of the
Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits of the Disputed Items. For example,
should the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the Accounting 
Firm awards $600 in favor of Parent's position, sixty percent (60%) of the
costs of its review would be borne by Buyer and forty percent (40%) of the
costs would be borne by Parent. Except as provided in the preceding sentence,
all other costs and  expenses incurred by the parties hereto in connection
with resolving any dispute hereunder before the Accounting Firm shall be borne
by the party incurring such cost and expense. In resolving the Disputed Items,
the Accounting Firm (A) shall be  bound by the provisions of this Section
2.07, (B) may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value
claimed for such item or less than the  smallest value for such item claimed
by either Buyer or Parent and (C) shall limit its decision to such items as
are in dispute and to only those adjustments as are necessary for the Proposed
Purchase Price Calculations to comply with the  provisions of this Agreement.
Such determination of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon
the parties hereto absent fraud or manifest error.

 

(d) The parties agree that they will, and agree to cause their respective
Representatives to, cooperate and assist in the calculation of  the Final
Purchase Price and in the conduct of the review by the Accounting Firm of any
proposed calculations of the Final Purchase Price or the components thereof,
including the making available, to the extent necessary, of books, records,
work  papers and personnel.

 

(e) If the Final Purchase Price is equal to or greater than the Estimated
Purchase Price, then Buyer shall promptly (but in any event  within ten (10)
Business Days after the date on which the Final Purchase Price is determined
pursuant to this Section 2.07) pay to the Seller or any other  Affiliate of
Parent as designated by Parent an aggregate cash amount equal to such excess
(if any), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or
accounts as directed by Parent in the Closing Notice (or such other accounts
as  Parent shall designate in writing to Buyer).

 


 

 

 

4  

(f) If the Estimated Purchase Price is greater than the Final Purchase Price,
then the Seller shall promptly (but in any event within ten  (10) Business
Days after the date on which the Final Purchase Price is determined pursuant
to this Section 2.07) pay to Buyer an aggregate cash amount equal to  such
excess, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or
accounts as Buyer shall designate in writing to Parent.

 

(g) Any amount paid pursuant to this Section 2.07  shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for tax reporting purposes.

 

Section 2.08 _Accounting Procedures_.   The Estimated Purchase Price, the
Proposed Purchase Price Calculations, the Final Purchase Price and the
determinations and calculations contained therein shall be prepared and
calculated based on the reference financial information of the Company 
prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied in a manner consistent with the
Transaction Accounting Principles and Reference Working Capital Statement set
forth on _Exhibit    B_ , except that such statements, calculations and
determinations: (i) shall not include any purchase accounting or other
adjustment arising out of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) shall be  based on facts and circumstances as they exist
as of the Closing and shall exclude the effect of any act, decision or event
occurring after the Closing, (iii) shall follow the defined terms contained in
this Agreement whether or not such terms are  consistent with GAAP and (iv)
shall calculate any reserves, accruals or other non-cash expense items on a
pro rata (as opposed to monthly accrual) basis to account for a Closing that
occurs on any date other than the last day of a fiscal period.   For the
avoidance of doubt, in the event that there is any inconsistency between GAAP
and the Transaction Accounting Principles and sample calculation of Reference
Working Capital Statement set forth on _Exhibit B_, the Transaction Accounting
Principles and Reference Working Capital Statement set forth on _Exhibit B_  
shall apply. For the avoidance of doubt, no amount shall be double-counted in
calculating the amounts comprising either the Estimated Purchase Price or the

standing would not result in a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

authorizations and other actions described in Section 5.04 have been obtained
or taken, the execution, delivery and performance by  Buyer of, and the

where the failure to obtain such consent, approval, authorization or action,

Financing to which Buyer is a party that would permit the Financing Sources to
reduce the total amount of  the Financing necessary to fund the Required
Payments (as defined below), impose any additional conditions precedent to the
availability of the full amount of the Debt Financing necessary to fund the
Required Payments, modify the conditions  precedent to the availability of

9.01  and Section 9.03, Buyer is unaware of any fact or occurrence existing
on the date hereof that could reasonably be expected to make any of the

the Financing to be delayed.

 

(f) As of the date hereof, assuming satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in Section 9.01 and Section 9.03, Buyer has no reason to believe
that it or any of the other parties to the Commitment  Documentation will be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis any condition of the Commitment
Documentation required to be satisfied by it or that the full amount of
funding contemplated in the Financing shall not be made available to Buyer on
the  Closing Date in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

(g) The aggregate proceeds of the Financing (after netting out fees, expenses,
original issue discount and similar premiums or charges  payable by Buyer and
after giving effect to the maximum amount of "flex" and original issue
discount provided under the Commitment Documentation) together with cash on
hand shall be sufficient to enable Buyer to pay the Purchase Price and all
fees,  costs, expenses and other amounts payable by Buyer related to the
Financing and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
the " _Required Payments_ ").

 

(h) Buyer understands and acknowledges that the obligations of Buyer under
this Agreement are not contingent on the availability of the  Financing, the
consummation of the Financing or the availability of Buyer to obtain any
financing for, or related to, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection with the

been prepared in good faith based on assumptions that were and continue to be
reasonable, (iii) the conditions set forth in Section 9.01, Section 9.02, and
Section 9.03 have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that
by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time); and (iv) neither
the  Company Group, taken as a whole, nor the Business is insolvent
immediately before the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the  consummation of any financing arrangements entered
into in connection therewith):

 

(a) the fair saleable value (determined on a going concern basis) of the
assets of Buyer will be greater than the total amount of its  liabilities
(including all liabilities, whether or not reflected in a balance sheet
prepared in accordance with GAAP, and whether direct or indirect, fixed or
contingent, secured or unsecured, disputed or undisputed);

 

(b) Buyer will be able to pay its debts and obligations in the ordinary course
of business as they become due; and

 

(c) Buyer will have adequate capital to carry on its businesses and all
businesses in which it is about to engage.

that it has made its own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon,
has formed an independent judgment concerning the Seller, the Company the
Transferred Companies, the Purchased Shares, and the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement and any other assets, rights or obligations to
be transferred hereunder or pursuant hereto. Except for the specific

the Seller, the Company or the Transferred Companies, prior to the Closing, or

Residuals shall have been retained in the unaided memory (without
intentional  memorization) of such employees in intangible form and without
use of tangible copies of any Specific Unregistered IP. For the avoidance of
doubt, any trade secrets, recipes, proprietary know-how, processes or product

this Agreement by reference and shall continue in full force and effect (and
the confidentiality obligations thereunder shall be binding upon Buyer  and
its Affiliates and Representatives as if parties thereto) until the Closing,
at which time the confidentiality obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate. If, for any reason, the Closing does not occur, the
Confidentiality  Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in

(b) For a period of seven (7) years from the date hereof, the Seller and its

obligations, the Seller shall be responsible, or (ii) if the Seller, or any of
its Representatives is compelled (whether by deposition, interrogatory,
request for documents, subpoena, civil  investigation, demand, order or other
legal process) or otherwise required by Law to disclose any such Confidential
Information. In the event that any demand or request for disclosure of
Confidential Information is made pursuant to clause (ii)  above, the Seller
shall (x) as promptly as practicable notify Buyer of the existence of such
request or demand to the extent practicable and, if not otherwise prevented by
Law, the disclosure that is expected to be made in respect thereto so that 
Buyer may, at its expense, seek a protective order or other appropriate
assurance that confidential treatment will be afforded to the Confidential
Information and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section
6.04(b), and (y) if requested by Buyer, cooperate with Buyer (at Buyer's
expense) in seeking a protective order or other appropriate assurance that

or the receipt of a waiver by Buyer is not obtained and the Seller or any of
its Representatives is required by such Law to  disclose any Confidential
Information, the Seller or such Representative may disclose only that portion
of the Confidential Information which is required to be disclosed.

independently developed by the Seller, or any of its Representatives without

parties hereto, which  consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of the
non-requesting party, and (ii) Buyer agrees, at Buyer's sole cost, to take any
and all actions that are necessary or reasonably advisable to avoid or

may be asserted or required by any Governmental Authority to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement as expeditiously as possible,
and in any event prior to the End Date, including (A) proposing, negotiating,
committing to, effecting and agreeing to, by consent decree, hold separate
order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license,  hold separate, and

their respective Affiliates; and (E) entering into any Governmental Order,
consent decree or other agreement to effectuate any of the foregoing  (the "

connection with the HSR Act shall be borne by Buyer.

 

(b) Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto of any substantive oral or written communication it  receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Agreement, permit the other parties hereto to review in advance, and shall
consider in good faith the comments of the other party in connection with,
any  substantive communication proposed to be made by such party (or its
advisors) to any Governmental Authority, and shall provide the other parties
hereto with copies of all correspondence, filings or other communications
between them or any of their  Representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement, subject to Section 6.02(d).     No party to this
Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting or substantive discussion
with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation
or other inquiry unless, to the extent reasonably practicable, it consults 
with the other parties hereto in advance and, to the extent practicable and
permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other parties hereto the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Subject to the
Confidentiality  Agreement and applicable Law, the parties to this Agreement

in the  Commitment Documentation, including using reasonable best efforts to
(i) maintain in effect and comply with its obligations under the Commitment
Documentation, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect to the Financing on the  terms (including the market flex provisions
set forth in the Fee Letter) (unless and to the extent any modification in
terms are acceptable to Buyer) and subject only to the conditions set forth in
the Commitment Documentation, (iii) satisfy (and  cause its Affiliates to
satisfy) on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Buyer within its
control in the Commitment Documentation and the definitive

 


 

 

 

36  

agreements related thereto (or, if necessary or deemed advisable by Buyer,

contained in the Commitment Documentation or such definitive agreements
related thereto), (iv) upon the satisfaction of all conditions applicable to
the Financing, consummate the Financing at or prior to the  Closing Date, (v)
enforce its rights under the Commitment Documentation and the definitive
agreements relating to the Financing and (vi) comply with its obligations
under the Commitment Documentation and the definitive agreements relating to
the  Financing. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event

of the Debt Financing Sources. Buyer shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Seller, agree to or permit any termination of or amendment,
restatement, amendment  and restatement, supplement or modification to be
made to, or grant any waiver of any provision under, the Commitment
Documentation or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing if such
termination, amendment, restatement, supplement,  modification or waiver
would be reasonably expected to: (A) reduce the aggregate amount of any
portion of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be
paid or original issue discount) unless an alternative source of financing
is  increased by a corresponding amount, so long as such alternative source
of financing does not include terms that would constitute a Prohibited
Amendment (defined below) under clauses (B), (C) and (D) below such that the
aggregate amount of the  Financing would be below the amount necessary to
fund the Required Payments; (B) adversely impact the ability of Buyer to
enforce its rights against other parties to the Commitment Documentation or
the definitive agreements with respect to the  Financing; (C) impose new or
additional conditions precedent to the availability of the full amount of the
Financing necessary to fund the Required Payments or otherwise amend, modify
or expand any of the conditions precedent to the Financing, or  otherwise
amend any other provision of the Commitment Documentation in a manner that
could reasonably be expected to delay or prevent or make less likely to occur
the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the
Financing) on  the Closing Date or (D) prevent, materially delay or impede
the Closing or the date on which the Financing would be obtained (the
amendments described in the foregoing clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D), the "
_Prohibited Amendments_ "); provided that, notwithstanding anything in this 
Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall be permitted to replace the Debt
Financing with alternative debt financing from the same or alternative sources
in an amount sufficient when combined with the Equity Financing to consummate
the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement with terms (unless and to
the extent any modification in terms acceptable to Buyer) and conditions
(including market flex provisions) not less favorable to Buyer, including with
regards to the certainty of funding  (including as to timing and amounts
necessary), taken as a whole, than as set forth in the Commitment
Documentation. Buyer shall deliver to the Seller true and complete copies of
any amendment, modification, supplement, consent or waiver to or  under the
Commitment Documentation or the definitive agreements relating to the
Financing promptly upon execution thereof other than (1) amendments or
modifications solely for the purpose of joining additional arrangers or
financing sources  following the date hereof to the extent effected pursuant
to the terms of the Commitment Documentation or (2) amendments or
modifications to the terms that have been redacted in the Fee Letter.

(b) Buyer shall keep the Seller informed on a current basis and in reasonable
detail, upon the reasonable request of the Seller, of the  status of its
efforts to arrange the Financing. Buyer shall give the Seller prompt notice
(i) of any material breach or material default or actual or threatened
repudiation or termination (whether in whole or in part) by any party to the 
Commitment Letter or definitive documents related to the Financing of which
Buyer becomes aware, in each case that would reasonably be expected to
materially impair or delay the Closing, (ii) of the receipt of any written
notice or other written  communication from any Financing Source with respect
to any (A) material breach, default or actual or threatened repudiation or
termination (whether in whole or in part) by any party to the Commitment
Documentation or any definitive document  related to the Financing of any
provisions of the Commitment Documentation or any definitive document related
to the Financing or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to the Commitment Documentation or any definitive  document related
to the Financing with respect to the conditionality or amount of the Financing
or the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be
funded at the Closing (but excluding ordinary course negotiations), in each 
case that would reasonably be expected to materially impair or delay the
Closing and (iii) of the occurrence of an Event that could reasonably be
expected to adversely impact the ability of Buyer to obtain all or any portion
of the Financing  contemplated by the Commitment Documentation at the
Closing. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within two (2)
Business Days of the date the Seller delivers to Buyer a written request,
Buyer shall promptly inform the Seller in  reasonable detail of any
circumstance referred to in the immediately preceding sentence. If any portion
of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including
any applicable market flex provisions) contemplated by the  Commitment
Documentation and alternative financing (so long as the terms thereof are of
the type that would not constitute a Prohibited Amendment) is not then made
available in an amount equal to such portion, and such portion is required to
fund  the Required Payments, Buyer shall promptly notify the Seller in
writing and Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain
in replacement thereof, and negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect to, alternative  financing from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with
terms (unless and to the extent any modification in terms acceptable to Buyer)
and conditions (including market flex  provisions) not less favorable to
Buyer, including with regards to the certainty of funding, taken as a whole,
than as set forth in the Commitment Documentation, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event. Buyer shall  deliver to the Seller
true and complete copies of all contracts, agreements or other arrangements
(including fee letters redacted in a manner similar to the Fee Letter)
pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed to
provide  any portion of the Financing. For purposes of this Section 6.09, (x)
references to the "Debt Commitment Documentation" shall include such documents
as permitted  to be amended, modified, supplemented or replaced by this
Section 6.09 and (y) references to "Debt Financing" and "Financing" shall
include the debt financing  contemplated by the Debt Commitment Documentation
as permitted to be amended, restated, amended and restated, modified,
supplemented or replaced by this Section 6.09.

in each case at Buyer's sole cost and expense, all cooperation as is customary

syndication and consummation of the Financing (including the satisfaction of
the conditions precedent applicable thereto to the extent within the control
of such parties), including to (i) furnish Buyer and its Debt Financing
Sources (or any  replacement thereof) all information reasonably requested by
Buyer and its Debt Financing Sources (or any replacement

with, to the extent required, customary authorization letters (including
customary representations with respect to accuracy of information) authorizing
the distribution of such information), (ii) designate  appropriate members of
management of the Seller and the Company to provide such cooperation in
connection with the Financing as is reasonably requested by Buyer and its

providers or potential providers of the Debt Financing and ratings agencies at
times and locations to be  reasonably mutually agreed upon, (iii) assist with
the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, bank information
memoranda and other customary marketing materials and similar documents in
connection with the Debt Financing, in each  case, to the extent reasonably

be effective prior to, the Closing Date, (v) provide reasonable  assistance
in the preparations for the pledging of collateral (it being understood that
no such pledging of collateral will be effective until at or after the Closing
Date) and (iv) to the extent timely requested by Buyer and required under
the  Commitment Letter, (A) obtain customary payoff letters and documents
reasonably requested by Buyer or its Financing Sources relating to the
repayment of the existing indebtedness of the Company and the release of
related liens and related  guarantees, if any, and (B) no later than three

rules and regulations, including without limitation the USA PATRIOT Act and
regulations regarding beneficial ownership, relating to the Company, in each
case, as reasonably requested by Buyer at least ten (10) Business Days prior
to the  Closing Date.

 

(d) The Company (i) shall use reasonable best efforts, and shall cause the
Transferred Companies to use their reasonable best efforts, to  deliver the
pro forma financial statements identified in paragraph 8 of Exhibit C of the
Debt Commitment Letter within 43 days of the end of the applicable fiscal

Company, (ii) cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement to be
breached by the Seller or the Company, (iii) require the Seller or the Company
to bear any cost or expense, pay any commitment or other fee, enter into any

(e) _Pre-existing Conditions; Coordination_.   Buyer shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive
limitations on benefits relating to any pre-existing conditions of the
Continuing Employees and their eligible spouses and dependents under any
group  welfare benefit plans (other than plans providing long-term disability
benefits) in which the Business Employees are eligible to participate on or
after the Closing Date during the plan year in which the Closing occurs and
(ii) recognize for  purposes of annual deductible and out of pocket limits
under the group health plans in which the Continuing Employees are eligible to
participate on or after the Closing Date, deductible and out of pocket
expenses paid by Continuing Employees and  their respective eligible spouses
and dependents under the group health plans of the Company, any Transferred
Company and their respective Affiliates in the plan year in which the Closing
Date occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent  that any Business
Employee is disabled as of the Closing Date (or, if later, the last day of any
post-closing welfare benefit transition period under the Transition Services
Agreement), Seller's long-term disability plan shall be responsible for 
providing long-term disability benefits that become payable due to such
Business Employee's continued disability following such date.

 

(f) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event later  than the first

Business Employee the transaction completion bonuses in the amounts set forth
on _Section 7.01(f)_ of the Disclosure Letter and (ii) pay to each Business
Employee identified by Parent prior to the Closing Date, amounts in respect of
pro-rated annual cash bonuses for fiscal year 2019 through the Closing  Date
determined by Parent to be earned pursuant to and otherwise consistent with
bonus measures applied under the applicable annual incentive plan or sales
incentive plan of Parent through the Closing Date (it being understood that,
for the  avoidance of doubt) the amounts to be paid pursuant to clause (i)
and (ii) hereof shall constitute Debt).

 

(g) Except as provided otherwise under the Transition Services Agreement,
Seller shall or shall cause its Affiliates to take any action  necessary, to
cause the Company and each Transferred Company to cease participation in each
Parent Plan and each applicable Business Employee (and any beneficiaries or
dependents thereto) to cease participating in or accruing benefits under any 
Parent Plan other than any Company Plan, in each case effective as of the
Closing Date. Except as provided otherwise under the Transition Services
Agreement, other than with respect to the Company Plans, Seller and its
Affiliates shall retain the  sponsorship of and be solely responsible for all
Liabilities with respect to the Business Employees and former employees of the
Company or the Transferred Companies arising under any Parent Plan prior to
the Closing, including without limitation,  any claims under a Parent Plan
providing group health benefits that are incurred prior to the Closing (and,
for this purpose, group health claims are deemed incurred when the underlying
medical service relating to such claim is performed).

(h) Effective as of the Closing, Seller shall cause all Business Employees who
participate in the Campbell Soup Company 401(k) Retirement  Plan (the "

have and retain all obligations to provide continuation coverage under Section
4980B of the Code with respect to all former employees of the  Company or the

(i) Seller shall retain all Liabilities and shall indemnify and hold the
Company and each Transferred Company harmless with respect to  workers
compensation claims not reflected in the most recent Financial Information
attributable to injuries and illnesses of Business Employees and former
employees of the Company or any Transferred Company that occurred from January
1, 2015  through the Closing.

 

Section 7.02 _Effect of Agreement; No Third Party  Beneficiaries_.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Seller, the Company, each
Transferred Company, Buyer and their respective Affiliates hereby acknowledge
and agree that all provisions contained in this Article VII are included for
the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and that nothing in this Agreement,
whether express or implied, (a) shall be treated as an  amendment or other
modification of any Employee Plan or other employee benefit plan, agreement or
other arrangement, (b) shall limit the right of Buyer, the Seller, the
Company, each Transferred Company or their respective Affiliates to amend, 
terminate or otherwise modify any Employee Plan or other employee benefit
plan, agreement or other arrangement following the Closing Date, or (c) shall
create any third party beneficiary or other right (x) in any other Person,
including, without  limitation, any current or former director, officer,
employee or independent contractor of the Seller, the Company, the Transferred
Companies or any participant in any Employee Plan or other employee benefit
plan, agreement or other arrangement (or  any dependent or beneficiary
thereof) or (y) to continued employment or service or any terms of employment
(including any particular level of compensation or benefits) with Buyer, the
Seller, the Company, the Transferred Companies or any of their  respective
Affiliates.

Section 8.02 _Filing of Tax Returns and Audit._

 

(a) Parent or the Seller shall timely prepare and file (or cause to be timely
prepared and filed) all Tax Returns that are required to be  filed by or with
respect to the Company or any of the Transferred Companies on an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary basis with Parent, the Seller or their
respective Affiliates (other than the Company or any of the Transferred 
Companies) (each such Tax Return, a " _Consolidated Tax Return_ "). Parent or
the Seller shall timely pay (or cause to be timely paid) all Taxes shown as
due on  such Tax Returns. The Seller shall control any Action, proposed
adjustment or deficiency, or assessment in respect of any such Consolidated
Tax Returns; provided that, to the extent such matter could reasonably be
expected to have a material and  adverse effect on the Company or any
Transferred Company in a taxable period beginning after the Closing Date,
Parent and Seller (and their Affiliates) shall provide notice to Buyer of the
outcome of such matter. The Seller shall be entitled to  (i) any refunds of
Taxes reported on a Consolidated Tax Return and borne by Seller or its
Affiliates, and (ii) any Prior Period Refunds, provided that Seller pays over
such Prior Period Refunds to the appropriate recipient pursuant to the
contract  described in the definition of Prior Period Refunds and (iii) any
cash Tax refunds (or credits (or deemed credits) in lieu thereof) attributable
to the overpayments of state Income Taxes prior to Closing by the Company or a
Transferred Company set  forth in _Section 8.02(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter,
in the amounts listed therein, as and when received as a cash refund (or
utilized as a credit to offset  Taxes otherwise payable by the Company or a
Transferred Company, or deemed utilized as such a credit, based on a "closing
of the books" method), except to the extent included as an asset in the
determination of Accrued Income Taxes. The Company  shall, at Seller's
expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to file for and claim the Tax
refunds (or credits) described in clause (iii) of the preceding sentence.

 

(b) Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company and  any of the
Transferred Companies) to, carry back any Tax items from any Tax period (or
portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date to any Consolidated Tax Return
for a Tax period beginning on or before the Closing Date.

 

(c) The parties hereto shall use the interim closing of the books method at
the end of the Closing Date for purposes of determining  allocations that
must be made to the Company and the Transferred Companies for U.S. federal,
and applicable state and local, income Tax purposes (including pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(1)), provided that any 
extraordinary transactions taken by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Company or any of the Transferred Companies)
on the Closing Date after the Closing will be allocated pursuant to the "next
day" rule  under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) to the
Tax Return for the Tax period beginning on the day after the Closing Date. The
parties agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, Unpaid
Transaction Expenses or  any other amounts incurred by Seller, the Company or
any Transferred Company in connection with the transactions under this
Agreement and taken into account as a liability in the Purchase Price will be
reported on Consolidated Tax Returns.

 

Section 8.03 _Tax Cooperation_. Parent  and Seller (and their Affiliates) and
Buyer shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as
promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating to the
Company and the Transferred Companies as is reasonably  necessary for the
filing of all Tax Returns (including the provision of any information that may
be necessary or useful for obtaining any available mitigation, reduction or
exemption from any Taxes), the making of any election related to Taxes, the 
preparation for, or the prosecution or defense of, any audit or other
proceeding related to Taxes and all other Tax matters relating to the Company
or any of the Transferred Companies. Buyer agrees that it shall preserve and
keep, or cause to be  preserved and kept, all original books and records in
respect of the Company and the Transferred Companies relating to any Taxes
with respect to taxable years or periods (in whole or in part) ending on or
before the Closing Date and in the  possession of Buyer or its Affiliates.

 


 

 

 

46  


 

 

Section 8.04 _Pre-Closing Tax Indemnity_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, Parent shall defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer, the Company and the Transferred Companies  (collectively, the
" _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") from and against, and pay or reimburse the Buyer
Indemnitees for, any Taxes incurred by a Buyer Indemnitee by reason  of
having been a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary Tax
group which group includes as a member Parent, the Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates (other than the Company or any of the Transferred
Companies) prior to  the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (and any comparable provisions under state, local
or foreign Law).

 

(b) To the extent permitted under applicable Tax Law, the parties agree to
treat any indemnity payment made under this Section 8.04 as an adjustment to
the Final Purchase Price for all federal, state, local and foreign Tax
purposes, and the parties agree to, and shall cause their  respective
Affiliates to, file their Tax Returns accordingly.

 

Section 8.05 _Tax Sharing Agreements_.   On or before the Closing Date,
Seller shall or shall cause all Tax sharing or Tax allocation agreements
(other than this Agreement), if any, to which the Company or any Transferred
Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates  (other than
the Company or a Transferred Company), on the other hand, are parties to be
terminated, and neither the Company nor any Transferred Company shall have any
rights or obligations pursuant to any such agreements after the Closing.

 

Section 8.06 _Merger_. The Parties  agree to cooperate in good faith from and
after the date hereof to amend this Agreement to provide for the acquisition
of the Company by way of a merger rather than a stock purchase such that the
Company survives as a wholly owned subsidiary of  Buyer (or such other
alternative structure that would have the effect of treating the Company, for
U.S. federal and applicable state and local state tax purposes, as having
borrowed the leveraged portion of the Final Purchase Price proceeds and 
distributing such proceeds to the Seller immediately prior to Closing) if the
Seller determines in its sole discretion that such merger (or alternative
transaction) has no adverse effect on the Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 


 

 

 

47  


 

 

Section 8.07 _Garden Fresh_.

 

(a) On or before the Closing Date, Parent, Seller and Company shall cause all
purchase price adjustment obligations of the Company under  Section 2.07 of
the Garden Fresh Agreement to be assigned to an Affiliate of Parent other than
a member of the Company Group.

_Section 8.01_ of the Garden Fresh Agreement, Parent shall promptly notify
Buyer of such payment.

Guarantors or the other Buyer Related Parties party to the Limited Guarantees,
the Equity Commitment Letters or the Confidentiality Agreement, pursuant to,
and in accordance with the  terms thereof) shall have any Liability for any
obligations or liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim
(whether in tort, Contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement or in respect of any

warranties of the other party or parties hereto contained in this Agreement or
in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions of the other party or parties

agreements or conditions shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with

shall be valid only if  set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
party hereto granting such extension or waiver. Neither the waiver by any of
the parties hereto of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of
this Agreement, nor the failure by any  of the parties hereto, on one or more

unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by
Law or  by any listing agreement with a national securities exchange;
_provided_ , that neither the Seller nor Buyer will be required to obtain the

announcement or (b) in connection with any dispute between the parties
regarding any of the Transaction Agreements.

effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or  incapable of being enforced, the parties to this
Agreement shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the  transactions contemplated by
this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest
extent possible.

 

Section 11.05 _Entire Agreement_.   Except as otherwise specifically provided
in the Transaction Agreements, the Transaction Agreements constitute the

on the other hand, with respect to the subject matter  of the Transaction
Agreements and supersede all prior representations, agreements, undertakings
and understandings, both written and oral, other than the Confidentiality
Agreement to the extent not in conflict with this Agreement, between or on 
behalf of the Seller and the Company, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand, with respect to the subject matter of the Transaction Agreements.

the Company may assign any or all of its rights and  obligations under this
Agreement to any of their controlled Affiliates and (ii) Buyer may (A) assign
all or part of it rights or obligations hereunder to one or more of its

debt financing source of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, in each case of
clauses (A) through (B), without the consent of Parent or Seller; _provided_
that  no such assignment shall release Buyer from any liability or obligation
under this Agreement. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section

the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the parties hereto and their
permitted successors and assigns.

of this Agreement, including any Section of the Disclosure Letter, shall be
deemed to be disclosed for purposes of other Sections of this Agreement,

disclosure is reasonably sufficient so that the relevance of such disclosure
would be reasonably apparent to a reader of this Agreement and of such
disclosure. Matters reflected in any Section of the Disclosure Letter that are
not  required by this Agreement to be so reflected are set forth solely for
informational purposes. No reference to or disclosure of any item or other
matter in any Section of this Agreement, including any Section of the

(a) This Agreement and each other Transaction Agreement and all claims or
causes of action (whether in contract or in tort) that may be  based upon,

or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement and each other

 


 

 

 

55  

Transaction Agreement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Delaware  applicable to contracts made and performed
in such State without giving regard to any conflict of laws provisions that
would require or permit the application of the Laws of any other jurisdiction;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, except as
otherwise set forth in  the Debt Commitment Documentation as in effect as of
the date of this Agreement, including as it relates to (a) the interpretation
of the definition of Material Adverse Effect (and whether or not a Material
Adverse Effect has occurred under this  Agreement), (b) the determination of
the accuracy of any Specified Acquisition Agreement Representation (as defined
in the Debt Commitment Documentation) and whether as a result of any
inaccuracy of thereof Buyer and any of its Affiliates have the  right to
terminate its or their obligations under this Agreement and (c) the
determination of whether the Closing has been consummated in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement (which will, in each case, be governed by, and
construed and  interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the state of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or
rule that would cause the application of laws of any other jurisdiction), all
Actions and matters relating to the  interpretation, construction, validity
and enforcement (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort, or
otherwise) against any of the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to
the Debt Commitment Documentation or the performance thereof or  the Debt
Financing, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to conflicts of laws
principles or rules to the extent such principles or rules are not
mandatorily  applicable and would require or permit the application of the
Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

 

(b) Except as provided in Section 11.16, the parties  hereto hereby
irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware (or in the event, but only in the event, that such court
does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such action or proceeding,
the  Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division)
or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the action or proceeding is vested
exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of America, the United
States District Court for  the District of Delaware) over any dispute arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby and each party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of
such dispute or any suit, action or  proceeding related thereto may be heard
and determined in such courts. The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which they may now
or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such  dispute brought in such
court or any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such
dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a judgment in any such dispute
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any 
other manner provided by law.

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to process being served by any
party to this Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by  the delivery of
a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.02.

 

Section 11.11 _Specific Performance_.   Each party hereto acknowledges and
agrees that irreparable damage would occur, damages would be difficult to
determine and would be an insufficient remedy and no adequate remedy other
than specific performance would exist at law or in equity in the  event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in

 


 

 

 

56  

accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached (or any party
hereto threatens such a breach).   Therefore, it is agreed that subject to
the terms of this Section 11.11, each party shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent  breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof. Such remedies shall,
however, be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other
remedies which any party may have under this Agreement or  otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and/or anything herein to the contrary, it is
hereby acknowledged and agreed that the Seller and Parent shall be entitled to
seek specific performance to cause Buyer to cause the Equity Financing to be 
funded and to consummate the Closing if, but only if, (i) the conditions to
Closing set forth in Section 9.01 and Section 9.03 were satisfied (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at Closing, each of
which is reasonably expected to be satisfied at Closing), (ii) the  financing
provided for by the Debt Financing has been funded or the lenders providing
such financing have irrevocably confirmed in writing that such financing will
be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and
(iii)  the Company, the Seller and Parent have irrevocably confirmed in
writing that, if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and
Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur. The parties further
agree not to assert that a  remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to applicable Law or inequitable for any reason, and not to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for
any such breach or that Buyer, the Seller  otherwise have an adequate remedy
at law. Under no circumstances shall the Company, the Seller and Parent be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance to cause
the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this Agreement or the
Equity  Financing Commitment at the Closing in accordance with the terms of
this Section 11.11) or other equitable relief, on the one hand, and payment of
the Buyer Termination Fee if this Agreement has been validly terminated in
accordance with its terms and the Seller has requested and  received payment
of the Buyer Termination Fee (and any of the other amounts, as and when due,
owing to the Seller pursuant to Section 10.03(b)) both payment of any monetary
damages whatsoever, on the one hand, and payment of the Buyer Termination Fee,
on the other hand.

not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of  this Agreement; (h)
the Seller and Buyer have each participated in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement and if an ambiguity or question of interpretation should arise,
this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties 
hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or burdening
any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions in this
Agreement; (i) a reference to any Person includes such Person's permitted
successors and permitted  assigns; (j) any reference to " _days_ " means

deleted or  otherwise modified from any prior drafts of this Agreement or any
of the other Transaction Agreements shall not be used as an aid of
construction or otherwise constitute evidence of the intent of the parties
hereto, and no presumption or burden of  proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party hereto by virtue of such prior drafts.
