Agreement (the "Offer Conditions"), and no other conditions.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right (in their sole
discretion) to (x) waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law), or (y) to increase the amount of cash
constituting the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and
conditions of the Offer consistent with the terms of this Agreement; provided,
however, without the prior written consent of the Company, neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall (i) reduce the number of Shares sought to be purchased in the
Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable

Company, except if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section
8.1. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, Merger Sub

initial scheduled Expiration Time is less than fifteen (15) Business Days from
(but excluding the day of) the date on which the information required by
Section 6.9(d) has been provided by the Company, and if this Agreement shall
not have terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, then Merger Sub may extend
the Offer once until a time that is not later than midnight, New York time, on
the date that is fifteen (15) Business Days from (but excluding the day of)
the date on which the information required by Section 6.9(d) has been provided
by the Company. In addition, if at any then-scheduled Expiration Time, any of
the Offer Conditions is not satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) by Merger Sub, and if this Agreement shall not have terminated
in accordance with Section 8.1, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, extend the Offer from time to time for periods of up to five
(5) Business Days per extension (or such longer period as the Parties may
agree) until the date on which all of the Offer Conditions are satisfied or so
waived and the Offer is consummated; provided, however, that if the sole then-
unsatisfied condition is the Minimum Condition, Merger Sub shall extend the
Offer from time to time for up to a total of an additional ten (10) Business
Days and, if following such extension or extensions the Minimum Tender
Condition remains the sole then-unsatisfied condition, Merger Sub shall extend
the Offer if and only if the Company shall have requested in writing that
Merger Sub so extend the Offer. In addition, Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Expiration Time for the minimum period
required by the applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of
the SEC (or its staff), or rules of any securities exchange, in each case, as
applicable to the Offer. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to
the contrary, in no event shall Merger Sub be required to extend the Offer
beyond the Outside Date. In addition, Merger Sub may (and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, if requested by the Company), following the Acceptance Time,
make available one or more "subsequent offering periods" in accordance with
Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act (each a "Subsequent Offering Period");
provided, however, that Merger Sub shall not make available such a Subsequent
Offering Period in the event that, prior to the commencement of any such
Subsequent Offering Period, Parent and Merger Sub directly or indirectly own
more than ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding Shares.



(f) Subject to the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions as of the Expiration
Time, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, consummate the
Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for payment and pay for (subject
to any withholding of tax pursuant to Section 3.4(h)) all Shares validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) after the
Expiration Time and in accordance with applicable Law (the "Offer Closing" and
the time and date on which Merger Sub accepts such Shares for payment, the
"Acceptance Time"). Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub
on a timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any Shares that Merger Sub
becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for, pursuant to the Offer
and shall cause Merger Sub to fulfill all of Merger Sub's obligations under
this Agreement.

(g) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file a tender offer statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Schedule
TO") with the SEC with respect to the Offer, which shall contain or include as
exhibits an offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") and forms of the
related letter of transmittal and form of summary advertisement (the Schedule
TO and the Offer to Purchase, together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the "Offer Documents") and (ii) cause the Offer Documents
(in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act), along with
the notice of the Merger (the "Maryland Notice") required by Section
3-106(d)(1) of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the "MGCL"), to be
disseminated to the Company's stockholders of record. The Company shall
promptly furnish Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries as shall be required by the Exchange Act to be
set forth in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agrees to correct promptly any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents or the Maryland Notice if and to the extent that such information
becomes false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required
by Law, and Merger Sub further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the
Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to the Company's stockholders, in each case as soon as reasonably
practicable and as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal
securities Laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents (including any
amendments thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and
Merger Sub shall provide to the Company and its counsel (i) any comments or
communications, whether written or oral, that Parent or Merger Sub (or their
counsel) may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments or communications and
(ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the response to such comments
or communications and to provide comments on such response.

Section 1.2 Company Actions.

(a) On the date the initial Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the
Company shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") which shall, subject to subject to Section
6.3(b), include the Company Recommendation, and



shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 (as and to the extent required by the Exchange
Act) to be disseminated to the Company's stockholders. Parent and Merger Sub
shall promptly furnish the Company all information concerning Parent and the
subsidiaries of Parent (the "Parent Subsidiaries") as shall be required by the
Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company agrees to correct promptly any information provided by it for
use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information becomes
false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by Law,
and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the
Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated
to the Company's stockholders, in each case as soon as reasonably practicable
and as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities Laws.
Unless the Company Board has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change or in
connection therewith, Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (including any
amendment thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company shall
provide Parent and its counsel (i) any comments or communications, whether
written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such
comments or communications and (ii) unless the Company Board has effected an
Adverse Recommendation Change or in connection therewith, a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the response to such comments or communications
and to provide comments on such response. The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Recommendation contained in
the Schedule 14D-9.

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause
to be furnished to Parent and Merger Sub mailing labels containing the names
and addresses of the record holders of Shares as of the most recent
practicable date, together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security
position listings, and computer files in the Company's possession or control
regarding the Beneficial Owners of Shares, and shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to Parent and Merger Sub such additional available stockholder
information (including periodic updated lists of stockholders, security
position listings and computer files) as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably
request for the purpose of communicating the Offer to record and Beneficial
Owners of Shares. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except
for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any
other documents necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and Merger
Sub shall keep confidential and not disclose the information contained in any
such labels, lists, listings and files, and shall use such information only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated, shall deliver to the Company or destroy all copies of such
information then in their possession or control. In addition, in connection
with the Offer, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub to
disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Shares held in or subject to any
Company Benefit Plan and, to the extent provided for in such Company Benefit
Plan, to permit such holders of Shares to tender their Shares in the Offer.

Section 1.3 Directors.

(a) Effective upon the payment for all Shares accepted following the
Acceptance Time, and at all times thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to
designate such number of



directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board as is
equal to the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company Board
(determined after giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this
sentence) multiplied by (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing the aggregate
number of Shares Beneficially Owned by Parent and Merger Sub or their
respective Affiliates at such time by the total number of Shares then
outstanding, and the Company shall promptly take all actions reasonably
necessary to cause Parent's designees to be so elected, including, if
necessary, by increasing the size of the Company Board and/or obtaining the
resignations of one or more existing directors. Effective upon the payment for
all Shares accepted following the Acceptance Time, and at all times
thereafter, the Company shall, upon request of Parent, also cause individuals
designated by Parent to constitute at least the same percentage (rounded up to
the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of (i) each committee of the
Company Board, (ii) each board of directors (or similar governing body) of
each Company Subsidiary and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each
such board of directors.

(b) The Company's obligations to cause the election or appointment of Parent's
designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all
actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3, including mailing
to stockholders together with the Schedule 14D-9 the information required
under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable Parent's
designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board. Parent shall supply
to the Company in writing any information with respect to itself and its
officers, directors and Affiliates to the extent required for the Company to
comply with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 and Parent shall
be solely responsible for any such information. The provisions of Section
1.3(a) and Section 1.3(b) are in addition to and shall not limit any rights
that any of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates may have
as a record holder or Beneficial Owner of Shares or a matter of applicable Law
with respect to the election of directors or otherwise.

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parent's designees pursuant to
Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time, any amendment or termination of
this Agreement by the Company, any extension by the Company of the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger
Sub or waiver of any of the Company's rights hereunder shall require the
concurrence of a majority of the directors of the Company in office prior to
appointment of Parent's designees.

Section 1.4 The Top-Up Option.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up
Option"), exercisable only upon the terms and conditions hereof, to purchase
that number of Shares (the "Top-Up Shares") equal to the lowest number of
Shares that, when added to the number of Shares Beneficially Owned by Parent,
Merger Sub and any other Affiliates of Parent collectively at the time of
exercise (after giving effect to the Offer Closing), would constitute one
Share more than ninety percent (90%) of the total Shares then outstanding
(calculated on a fully diluted basis and after giving effect to the issuance
of the Top-Up Shares),



at a price per Top-Up Share equal to the Offer Price; provided, however, that
(x) in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of Shares
in excess of the Company's then authorized but unissued Shares (giving effect
to Shares reserved for issuance under the Company Benefit Plans and pursuant
to the exercise of any other securities convertible into or exchangeable into
Shares, if any, as if such Shares were outstanding); and (y) the Top-Up Option
will not be exercisable unless immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up
Shares the number of Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub and any other
Affiliates of Parent (after giving effect to the Offer Closing) will
constitute one Share more than ninety percent (90%) of the Shares that will
then be outstanding (calculated on a fully diluted basis).

(b) If there shall have not been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
that number of Shares which, when added to the number of Shares Beneficially
Owned by Parent, Merger Sub and any other Affiliates of Parent, would
constitute at least ninety percent (90%) of the total Shares outstanding at
the Acceptance Time (calculated on a fully diluted basis), Merger Sub shall be
deemed to have exercised the Top-Up Option and on such date shall give the
Company prior written notice specifying the number of Shares directly or
indirectly owned by Parent, Merger Sub and any other Affiliates of Parent at
the time of such notice (after giving effect to the Offer Closing). The
Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice (and in
any event no later than the Offer Closing), deliver written notice to Merger
Sub specifying, based on the information provided by Merger Sub in its notice,
the number of Top-Up Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up
Shares (the "Top-Up Closing"), which shall take place at the location of the
Closing specified in Section 2.2, and shall take place simultaneously with the
Offer Closing, (i) Parent or Merger Sub shall pay to the Company the aggregate
purchase price required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares, at the election of
Parent and Merger Sub, in cash or by delivery of a promissory note having full
recourse to Parent (which shall bear simple interest at a rate of 5% per annum
and shall mature six (6) months following the date of execution and delivery,
may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty,
shall automatically terminate (without repayment) upon occurrence of the
Effective Time and shall have no other material terms) and (ii) the Company
shall cause to be issued to Parent or Merger Sub a certificate representing
the Top-Up Shares, which certificate may include any legends required by
applicable securities Laws.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and Merger Sub agree that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be
acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by
Parent or Merger Sub for its own account, for the purpose of investment and
not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof
(within the meaning of the Securities Act).

Section 1.5 Short-Form Merger. If, after the consummation of the Offer and any
exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of Shares Beneficially Owned by
Parent, Merger Sub and any other Affiliates of Parent collectively represent
at least ninety percent (90%) of the then-outstanding Shares, Parent shall
cause Merger Sub, and the Company shall execute and deliver such documents and
instruments and take such other actions as Parent or Merger Sub



may reasonably request, to complete the Merger as promptly as reasonably
practicable without a meeting of the stockholders of the Company as permitted
by MGCL Section 3-106 and otherwise as provided in Article II below. If the
Effective Time has not occurred prior to October 1, 2014, then the Merger
shall, at the option of the Company Board, be governed by Section 3-106.1 of
the MGCL and effected on or after October 1, 2014 in accordance therewith. If
the Merger is governed by Section 3-106.1 of the MGCL, Section 1.4 of this
Agreement shall cease to be in effect and references in this Agreement to
Section 3-106 of the MGCL or ninety percent (90%) of the then-outstanding
Shares shall be deemed, respectively, to reference Section 3-106.1 of the MGCL
(with any necessary or appropriate changes to the enumeration or lettering of
subsections thereof) and two-thirds of the then-outstanding Shares, as
necessary or appropriate.

ARTICLE II

and acknowledged in accordance with the relevant provisions of the MGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at the time that the Articles of Merger are duly
accepted for record by the SDAT, or at such later time as Parent and the

ARTICLE III 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 3.1 Effect on Stock of the Company and Merger Sub. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder
of any Securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

(d) Subject to Section 3.1(b), Shares that are owned, directly or indirectly,
by Parent, the Company or Merger Sub (including as a result of the exercise of
the Top-Up Option by Merger Sub, if applicable) immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(e) Each Share held by any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into such number of shares of stock of the
Surviving Corporation such that each such Company Subsidiary owns the same
percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time as such Company Subsidiary owned in
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(f) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than (i) Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 3.1(a) and
(ii) Shares described in Section 3.1(b)) shall at the Effective Time
automatically be converted into the right to receive, in cash and without
interest, an amount equal to the Offer Price (the "Merger Consideration").



(g) As of the Effective Time, all Shares converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 3.1 shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of (1) a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such Shares (a
"Certificate") or (2) Shares held in book entry form ("Book-Entry Shares")
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive (A) the Merger Consideration, (B) any dividends pursuant to Section
6.15 and (C) any other amounts expressly provided herein, without interest,
subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.4.

(h) Each share of stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 3.2 Certain Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (i) the
Effective Time or (ii) any termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article VIII, the outstanding Shares shall have been changed into a different
number of Shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares, readjustment, or other similar transaction,
or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within said
period, then the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly
dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide the holders of Company Common Stock (including Company Stock Options
exercisable for Company Common Stock and Company RSUs) the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this
Section 3.2 shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action that
is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this
Agreement.

Section 3.3 No Dissenters' or Appraisal Rights. No dissenters' or appraisal
rights (or rights of an objecting stockholder (under Section 3-201 et seq. of
the MGCL or otherwise) shall be available with respect to the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 3.4 Exchange of Company Common Stock.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a customary exchange
agreement with a nationally recognized financial institution designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent"). Prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or shall cause to be provided to the
Paying Agent cash in an aggregate amount necessary to pay the Merger
Consideration (such cash provided to the Paying Agent is hereinafter referred
to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Paying Agent shall deliver the Merger
Consideration to be issued pursuant to Section 3.1 out of the Exchange Fund.
Except as provided in Section 3.4(g), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose.

(c) Exchange Procedures.



(i) Certificates. Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, to each holder of record of a
Certificate whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1, (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
pay and deliver in exchange thereof as promptly as practicable, cash in an
amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of
Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be
paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

(ii) Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent
to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this Article III. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or
more Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1 shall automatically upon the
Effective Time (or, at any later time at which such Book-Entry Shares shall be
so converted) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent
to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, cash
in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of
shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Book-Entry
Shares, and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon conversion of any
Book-Entry Shares.

(d) The Merger Consideration issued and paid in accordance with the terms of
this Article III upon the surrender of the Certificates (or, immediately, in
the case of the Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have been issued and
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock (other than the right to receive any dividends pursuant to
Section 6.15). After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of Shares that



were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article III.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former
holders of Company Common Stock for six (6) months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former
holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this
Article III shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation
for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration.

(f) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger Consideration remaining
unclaimed by former holders of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such
time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Entity shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable amount as Parent or the Paying
Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been
surrendered as provided in this Article III.

(h) The Paying Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent; provided, however, that no such investment income or gain
or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Common
Stock. Any interest, gains and other income resulting from such investments
shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent payable to Parent upon its
request, and no part of such interest, gains and other income shall accrue to
the benefit of holders of Company Common Stock; provided, however, that any
investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term
obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and
interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect
the amounts payable to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Article III. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange
Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to
be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit
cash into the Exchange Fund in an



amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to
fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

(i) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any former
holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may
be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or
under any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. Any amount deducted or
withheld pursuant to this Section 3.4(h) shall be treated as having been paid
to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made. Parent shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all amounts
so deducted or withheld to the appropriate taxing authority within the period
required under applicable Law.

Section 3.5 Further Assurances. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall determine that any actions are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to take all such
actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest all right, title or interest
in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

properties and assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted. The
Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except for those jurisdictions in which the failure to be so
qualified or licensed or to be in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(e) The Constituent Documents of the Company filed as an exhibit to the
Company SEC Documents as of June 8, 2014 are true, correct and complete
copies, as of such date, of the Constituent Documents of the Company. The

carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the failure to be
so duly incorporated, duly organized, validly existing or in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Subsidiary is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing, if

ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions in which the failure to be

Material Adverse Effect. None of the Company Subsidiaries is in violation of

Section 4.3 Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability; State Takeover
Statutes.

(j) The Company has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to perform its obligations under this Agreement and, in the
case of the Merger and if required by applicable Law, subject to the
affirmative vote of holders of not less than two-thirds of the outstanding
Shares at the Company Stockholders Meeting (the "Company Stockholder
Approval"), to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger (if required by applicable Law). The execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement, the performance and compliance by the Company with
each of its obligations herein and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company, subject, in the case of the
Merger and if required by applicable Law, to receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval. The Company has duly executed and delivered this
Agreement and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement, this Agreement constitutes the
Company's legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, except as limited by Laws affecting the enforcement
of creditors' rights generally, by general equitable principles or by the
discretion of any Governmental Entity before which any Proceeding seeking
enforcement may be brought.

recommending that the Company's stockholders accept the Offer, tender their
Shares in the Offer and, if required by applicable Law, vote in favor of the
approval of the Merger (the "Company Recommendation"). Subject to Section 6.3,
the Company Board has not rescinded, modified or withdrawn such resolutions in
any way. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent
in the last sentence of Section 5.3(a), such resolutions are sufficient to
render inapplicable to this Agreement, the Transactions and the other
transactions contemplated hereby the restrictions of Sections 3-601 through
3-605 of the MGCL, to the extent such restrictions would be applicable to this
Agreement, the Transactions or the other transactions contemplated hereby. No
other "business combination," "control share acquisition" (Sections 3-701 et
seq. of the MGCL), "fair price," "moratorium" or other takeover defense Laws

this Agreement, the Transactions or the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

required by applicable Law, is the only vote of holders of any class or series
of Company Capital Stock necessary to approve the Merger.

Section 4.4 Consents and Approvals; No Conflicts.

and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby do
not and will not require any consent, approval, waiver, license, permit,

record by the SDAT of the Articles of Merger pursuant to the MGCL, (iii) if
required by applicable Law, the Company Stockholder Approval, (iv) filings,
permits, authorizations, consents, notice to and approvals as may be required
under, and other applicable requirements of, (A) the Exchange Act, (B) the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), (C) the rules and
regulations of the NYSE and (D) the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), (v) Consents or Filings that become
applicable solely as a result of matters specifically related to Parent or any
of its Affiliates, and (vi) such other Consents of, or Filings with, any
Governmental Entity the failure of which to obtain or make, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(d) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by the Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i)
conflict with or

notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, result in
the termination of or a right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate
the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of
the respective properties or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries
under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, or by which they or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound or affected, except, in the case
of the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), for such violations as, individually or
in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

promulgated thereunder or under the Exchange Act (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"),
in each case to the extent applicable to such Company SEC Documents, and none
of the Company SEC Documents when filed or furnished (or in the case of a
registration statement under the Securities Act, at the time it was declared
effective) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading (and no Company SEC Document that is a registration
statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the
Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or amendment became
effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading).



(c) The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents (including, in each case, any notes or schedules

Company's accountants with respect thereto (the "Company SEC Financial
Statements"), have been derived from the accounting books and records of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and (i) as of their respective dates of
filing with the SEC complied as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of

Subsidiaries are required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial
statements of the Company. Except as required by GAAP and disclosed in the
Company SEC Documents, between January 1, 2013 and the date of this Agreement,

applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable

(f) Since January 1, 2013, the Company has designed and maintained disclosure
controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such
terms are defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. The Company's
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that all information
(both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in
the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The
Company's management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the



Company's disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, presented in any applicable Company SEC Document that is a
report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its conclusions
about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the
end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such
evaluation. Based on Company management's most recently completed evaluation
of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, (i) the Company

operation of its internal control over financial reporting that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Company's ability to record,

management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company's
internal control over financial reporting. Since January 1, 2013, to the

received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of, and to the Knowledge of
the Company, no auditor, accountant, or representative of the Company has
provided written notice to the Company or any executive officer or director
of, any substantive complaint or allegation that the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has engaged in improper accounting practices. Since January 1,
2013, to the Knowledge of the Company, no attorney representing the Company or
any Company Subsidiary has reported to the Company Board or any committee
thereof or to any current director or executive officer of the Company
evidence of a material violation of United States or other securities Laws or
breach of fiduciary duty by the Company or any of its executive officers or
directors.

(g) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether absolute or contingent, asserted or
unasserted, known or unknown, primary or secondary, direct or indirect, and
whether or not accrued), except (i) those that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, (ii) as reflected or reserved against in the most
recent audited balance sheet included in the Company SEC Financial Statements
or the notes thereto, (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of business since the date of the most recent audited balance

liabilities and obligations arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, the Transactions or the Pinnacle Merger Agreement. Neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract or arrangement (including any Contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the
Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any material "off-
balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the
Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract
or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving,
or material liabilities of, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in
the Company SEC Financial Statements or other Company SEC Documents.

Section 4.6 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since June 29, 2013 through

required to be filed with the SEC) will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder.

employer welfare arrangement as defined in Section 3(40) or ERISA, except, in
each case, as would not reasonably be expected to result in the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries incurring any material liability under Title IV of
ERISA.

(c) No Title IV Plan or any trust established thereunder has incurred any
"accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA and
Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the
most recent fiscal year of each Title IV Plan ended prior to the Effective
Time. No reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for
which the thirty (30) days' notice requirement has not been waived has
occurred. Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has, within the
preceding six (6) years, withdrawn in a complete or partial withdrawal from
any multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or incurred any
liability under Section 4204 of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full.

(d) Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code is so qualified and the plan as currently in effect has
received a favorable determination letter or opinion to that effect from the
Internal Revenue Service and the



Company is not aware of any reason why any such determination letter should be
revoked or not be reissued. The Company has made available to Parent copies of
the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination letter or opinion with
respect to each such Company Benefit Plan. Except as, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, (i) each Company Benefit Plan has been maintained in
compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all
statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including ERISA and the Code, which
are applicable to such Company Benefit Plan, (ii) there are no pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened Proceedings against any Company
Benefit Plan, any fiduciary thereof, the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
and (iii) all contributions required to be made by the Company or any of its
ERISA Affiliates to any Company Benefit Plan have been made on or before their
applicable due dates (and contributions for any period ending on or before the
Closing Date that are not due, are properly accrued to the extent required to
be accrued under applicable accounting principles). No events have occurred
with respect to a Company Benefit Plan that could result in payment or
assessment against the Company or any Company Subsidiary of any material
excise taxes under ERISA or the Code. To the Knowledge of the Company, except
as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, none of the Company, any
of the Company Subsidiaries, any officer of the Company or of any Company
Subsidiary or any of the Company Benefit Plans which are subject to ERISA,
including the Company Benefit Plans, any trusts created thereunder or any
trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited transaction"
(as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code)
or any other breach of fiduciary responsibility that could subject the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any officer of the Company or of any
Company Subsidiary to any Tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by
such Section 4975 of the Code or to any material liability under Section
502(i) or 502(1) of ERISA.

(e) Except as set forth in Section 4.11(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
there is no current or projected liability in respect of post-employment or
post-retirement health or medical or life insurance benefits for retired,
former or current employees of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, except
as required to avoid excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code. No condition
exists that would prevent the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates from
amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plan providing health or medical
benefits in respect of any current or former employees of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries other than limitations imposed under the terms of a
collective bargaining agreement.

(f) Except as otherwise contemplated under this Agreement, or as set forth in
Section 4.11(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the execution nor
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall, whether alone or in combination with any other
event (i) result in the accelerated vesting or payment of, or any increase in,
or in the funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of, any compensation
or benefits to any present or former employee, consultant or director of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries; (ii) result in the entitlement of
any present or former employee, consultant or director of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries to severance or termination pay or benefits; (iii)
limit or restrict the right of the Company to merge, amend or



terminate any of the Company Benefit Plans; or (iv) result in any payment
under any of the Company Benefit Plans or any other arrangement that would not
be deductible under Section 280G of the Code.

(g) Except as set forth in Section 4.11(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
there is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other Contract covering any
employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that, considered
individually or considered collectively with any other such agreements, plans,
arrangements or other Contracts, will, or could reasonably be expected to,
give rise directly or indirectly to the payment of any amount that would be
characterized as a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2) of the Code. No director, officer, employee or independent
contractor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is entitled to receive or
will receive any gross-up or additional payment by reason of the "additional
tax" or "excise tax" required by Section 409A or 4999 of the Code being
imposed on such Person.

(h) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each
International Plan (i) has been maintained in compliance with its terms and
applicable Laws, (ii) if intended to qualify for special tax treatment, meets
all the requirements for such treatment, and (iii) if required, to any extent,
to be funded, book-reserved or secured by an insurance policy, is fully
funded, book-reserved or secured by an insurance policy, as applicable, based
on reasonable actuarial assumptions in accordance with applicable accounting
principles. From and after the Closing Date, Parent and its Affiliates will
receive the full benefit of any funds, accruals and reserves under the
International Plans.

(i) The ESOP and the Trust Agreement between the Company and the trustee of
the ESOP have been duly authorized and established by all necessary corporate
action on the part of the Company. The shares of Company Common Stock held by
the ESOP are owned of record and beneficially by the ESOP, free and clear of
all encumbrances other than the pledge in favor of the Company in connection
with ESOP Loans evidenced by the ESOP Loan Agreement by and between the
Company and the ESOP trustee. There are no liabilities of the ESOP other than
the ESOP Loans and the obligation to pay the benefits to the ESOP participants
under the ESOP in the ordinary course of business. There is no proceeding
pending before any Governmental Entity or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the ESOP, the ESOP trust or the ESOP trustee or any
properties of the ESOP, that would be expected to materially interfere with
the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. There is no judgment, decree or order against the ESOP trustee, the
ESOP trust or the ESOP or any properties of the ESOP, the ESOP trust or the
ESOP trustee that could prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or that would reasonably be
expected to materially interfere with the ability of the Company to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

letter, dated as of June 8, 2014, between Parent, Morgan Stanley Senior
Funding, Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments to such letter in
effect as of the date of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent (the "Commitment Letter") and (ii) a correct and complete fully
executed copy of the fee letter referenced in the Commitment Letter (the "Fee
Letter") (it being understood that such letter has been redacted to omit the
fee amounts and the economic provisions of the market flex provisions
therein). Pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the
Commitment Letter, the lender thereunder has committed to lend the amounts set
forth therein (the provision of such funds as set forth therein, but subject
to the provisions of Section 6.9, the "Financing") for the purposes set forth
in such Commitment Letter. Neither the Commitment Letter nor the Fee Letter
has been amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent, and the respective
commitments contained in the Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn,
rescinded, amended, restated or otherwise modified in any respect prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent. As of the execution and
delivery by Parent of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter is in full force
and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of
Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto,
enforceable in accordance with its terms against Parent and, to the Knowledge
of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, except as limited by Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, by general equitable
principles or by the discretion of any Governmental Entity before which any
Proceeding seeking enforcement may be brought. There are no conditions
precedent or contingencies (including pursuant to any "flex" provisions)
related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing pursuant to the
Commitment Letter, other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter, the net proceeds
contemplated from the Financing (without taking into account any proceeds of
the Parent's existing revolving credit facility or the 364-Day Senior
Unsecured Credit Facility contemplated by the Commitment Letter) will, in the
aggregate and when taken together with Parent's cash on hand, be sufficient
for the satisfaction of all of Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations under
this Agreement, including the payment of the consideration in the Offer and
the Merger Consideration, the funding of any required refinancings or
repayments of any existing Indebtedness of the Company or Parent in connection

expected to be incurred by Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation in
connection with the Transactions and the Financing. As of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent, (i) no event has occurred which would
constitute a breach or default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time
or both would constitute a default) or result in a failure to satisfy a
condition precedent, in each case, on the part of Parent or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, any other party to the Commitment Letter, under the Commitment
Letter, and (ii) Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing or any
other funds necessary for the satisfaction of all of Parent's and Merger Sub's
obligations under this Agreement and the payment of the required refinancing
or repayments of certain existing Indebtedness and of all fees and expenses
reasonably expected to be incurred in connection herewith will not be

their behalf makes any other express or any implied representations or
warranties in this Agreement with respect to (i) Parent or any of the Parent

condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects or any other matter relating

Section 6.2 Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting.

(h) If the Company Stockholder Approval is required under the MGCL in order to
consummate the Merger, then:

(vi) As promptly as practicable after the Acceptance Time, the Company shall
file with the SEC the Proxy Statement to be sent to the stockholders of the
Company relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the SEC to clear the Proxy Statement as
promptly as practicable after such filing (including by responding to comments
of the SEC). Parent shall furnish all information as may be reasonably
requested by the Company in connection with any such action and the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement.

(vii) As promptly as practicable after the clearance of the Proxy Statement by
the SEC, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to its stockholders. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without
providing Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon.

(viii) The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the
staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for
additional information and shall supply Parent with copies of all
correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement
or the Transactions.

(i) If the Company Stockholder Approval is required under the MGCL in order to
consummate the Merger, then:

(i) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the clearance of the
Proxy Statement by the SEC, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") for the
purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval.

(ii) Unless the Company has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Company shall, through the Company Board, make the Company Recommendation, and
shall include such Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and use its
reasonable best efforts to (x) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement, and (y) take all other action necessary or
advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval.

(j) If the Company Stockholder Approval is required under the MGCL in order to
consummate the Merger other than pursuant to Section 3-106 of the MGCL,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve the Company of
its obligation to submit the Merger to its stockholders for a vote on the
approval thereof. The Company agrees that,



unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with Article
VIII, its obligations to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting pursuant to this
Section 6.2(c) shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal,
public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Takeover Proposal or
by any Adverse Recommendation Change.

Section 6.3 No Solicitation.

(j) As of the date hereof, the Company shall immediately cease any discussions
or negotiations with any Person that may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover
Proposal and, if applicable, shall seek to have returned to the Company any
confidential information that had been provided in any such discussions or
negotiations. From and after the date hereof until the earlier to occur of the
Acceptance Time or the date of termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Article VIII, the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its officers,
directors or employees or any Affiliate, investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it or any of its
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage (including by way of furnishing information which has not been
previously publicly disseminated), or take any other action designed to
facilitate, any inquiry or the making of any proposal which constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement or other
agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to any Takeover Proposal
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or (iii) enter into,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding
any Takeover Proposal; provided, however, that if, prior to the Acceptance
Time, following the receipt of a Superior Proposal or a Takeover Proposal that
the Company Board determines in good faith is reasonably expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal, and the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that a failure to take action with
respect to such Takeover Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties (it being understood that, for all purposes of this Agreement,
references to fiduciary duties of the Company Board shall include the duties
of individual directors under the MGCL) to the Company and its stockholders
under applicable Law, the Company may, in response to such Takeover Proposal,
and subject to compliance with Section 6.3(c), (A) furnish information with
respect to the Company to the party making such Takeover Proposal pursuant to
a confidentiality agreement (an "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement") that
contains provisions not less favorable to the Company in all material respects
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that such
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement need not include a comparable standstill
provision if the Company (x) waives the standstill provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement in favor of Parent or (y) similarly modifies the
standstill provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement applicable to Parent,
and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with such party regarding such
Takeover Proposal. It is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set
forth in the preceding sentence by any officers, directors or employees or any
Affiliate, investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
Representative of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.3(a) by the Company.



(k) Except as expressly permitted in this Section 6.3(b), neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (1) withhold, withdraw or modify or
qualify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw or modify or qualify the
Company Recommendation, (2) take any other action or make any other statement
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
inconsistent with the Company Recommendation or (3) approve, determine to be
advisable, or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, determine to be
advisable, or recommend, any Takeover Proposal ((1), (2) and (3) being
referred to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change").

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company
Board may (in each case, subject to compliance with this Section 6.3(b) and to
compliance with Sections 6.3(a) and 6.3(c)) effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change and, subject to compliance with Section 8.1(c)(i), terminate this
Agreement in order to enter into a binding agreement for a Superior Proposal
if: (i) a written Takeover Proposal is or has been made to the Company by a
third party and such Takeover Proposal is not withdrawn; (ii) the Company
Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal; (iii) the Company Board concludes in good
faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel, that the
failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
would be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary duties to the Company
and its stockholders under applicable Laws; (iv) the Company Board provides
Parent at least three (3) Business Days' prior written notice of its intention
to take such action, which notice shall include the information with respect
to such Superior Proposal that is specified in Section 6.3(c), as well as a
copy of such Takeover Proposal; (v) during the three (3) Business Days
following such written notice (or such shorter period as is specified below),
the Company Board and its Representatives have negotiated in good faith with
Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) regarding any revisions to
the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby proposed by Parent in
response to such Superior Proposal; and (vi) at the end of the three (3)
Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (v), the Company Board
concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Company's (x) outside
legal counsel and financial advisors (and taking into account any adjustment
or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent),
that the Takeover Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal and (y) outside
legal counsel, that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement would be inconsistent with the exercise by the
Company Board of its fiduciary duties to the Company and its stockholders
under applicable Law. Any material amendment or modification to any Superior
Proposal will be deemed to be a new Takeover Proposal for purposes of this
Section 6.3; provided, however, that the notice period and the period during
which the Company Board and its Representatives are required to negotiate in
good faith with Parent regarding any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in response to such new Takeover Proposal pursuant to
clause (v) above shall expire on the later to occur of (x) 48 hours after the
Company Board provides written notice of such new Takeover Proposal to Parent
and (y) the end of the original three (3) Business Day period described in
clause (v) above. Nothing in this



Section 6.3(b) shall permit the Company, prior to termination of this
Agreement, to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
merger agreement or other agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to
any Takeover Proposal or Superior Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement). Unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with Section 7.1, the Company Board may not submit to the vote of
its stockholders any Takeover Proposal other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(ii) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company Board,
in circumstances not involving or relating to a Takeover Proposal, from
effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to material events or
changes arising after the date hereof that were not known or reasonably
foreseeable to the Company as of or prior to the date hereof (an "Intervening
Event") if (and only if) (A) the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary
duties to the Company and its stockholders under applicable Laws; (B) the
Company Board provides Parent at least three (3) Business Days' prior written
notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall include a
reasonably detailed description of the Intervening Event; (C) during the three
(3) Business Days following such written notice (or such shorter period as is
specified below), the Company Board and its Representatives have negotiated in
good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) regarding
any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby proposed by
Parent in response to such Intervening Event; and (D) at the end of the three
(3) Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (C), the Company
Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside
legal counsel, that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with the exercise by the Company Board of its fiduciary
duties to the Company and its stockholders under applicable Law. Any material
changes to an Intervening Event will be deemed to be a new Intervening Event
for purposes of this Section 6.3; provided, however, that the notice period
and the period during which the Company Board and its Representatives are
required to negotiate in good faith with Parent regarding any revisions to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such new Intervening
Event pursuant to clause (C) above shall expire on the later to occur of (x)
48 hours after the Company Board provides written notice of such new
Intervening Event to Parent and (y) the end of the original three (3) Business
Day period described in clause (C) above.

(l) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Sections 6.3(a)
and 6.3(b), the Company shall promptly, and in any event no later than
24-hours after it receives any Takeover Proposal, advise Parent orally and in
writing of any request for confidential information in connection with a
Takeover Proposal or of any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of such request or Takeover Proposal and the identity of the Person
making such request or Takeover Proposal and shall keep Parent promptly
advised of all changes to the material terms of any Takeover Proposal. The
Company shall, promptly and in any event within 24 hours, provide to Parent
any non-public information concerning the



Company and the Company Subsidiaries that the Company provides (including
through its Representatives) to any third Person in connection with any
Takeover Proposal after the date hereof that was not previously provided to
Parent.

(m) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 or Section 6.4 shall prohibit the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to their stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a
statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to their
stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Company's outside counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure
would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with applicable Law.

(n) For purposes of this Agreement:

(iv) "Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person
(other than Parent and its Subsidiaries or Affiliates) relating to (A) any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of the consolidated
assets (including equity interests in Subsidiaries) of the Company, or 20% or
more of any class of equity securities of the Company, (B) any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially
owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company and (C)
any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, or similar transaction involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which such Person (or its
stockholders) would own 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company
or 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or of any
resulting parent company of the Company.

(v) "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written Takeover Proposal from any
Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries or Affiliates) for a direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of 50% or more of the consolidated assets
(including equity interests in Subsidiaries) of the Company, or 50% or more of
any class of equity securities or voting power of the Company, any tender
offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person
beneficially owning 50% or more of any class of equity securities or voting
power of the Company, or any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to which
such Person (or its stockholders) would own 50% or more of the consolidated
assets of the Company or 50% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company or of any resulting parent company of the Company (in each case other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), (A) which is reasonably
capable of being completed within a reasonable period of time on the terms set
forth in such proposal, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory
and other aspects thereof that the Company Board deems relevant, (B) for which
the third party has demonstrated that the financing for such offer is fully
committed or is reasonably likely to be obtained, in each case as determined
by the Company Board in its good faith judgment (after consultation



with the Company's financial advisors and outside legal counsel) and (C) which
the Company Board has determined in its good faith judgment would, if
consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to its stockholders from a
financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.4 Publicity. Except with respect to, or following, any Adverse
Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and
except to the extent disclosed in or consistent with the Offering Documents or
the Proxy Statement, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other
before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment
upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Transactions, and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior
to such consultation, except as such Party may reasonably conclude may be
required by applicable Law or the rules of the NYSE (or any other securities
market).

Section 6.5 Notification of Certain Matters. Parent and the Company shall each
give prompt notice to the other Party if any of the following occur after the
date of this Agreement: (i) receipt of any written notice to the receiving
Party from any third Person alleging that the consent or approval of such
third Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such consent could (in
the good faith determination of such Party) reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) receipt of any notice or
other communication from any Governmental Entity or the NYSE (or any other
securities market) in connection with the Transactions and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (iii) the occurrence of an
event which would or would be reasonably likely to (A) prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the Transactions or the other transactions
contemplated hereby or (B) result in the failure of any condition to the Offer
or the Merger set forth in Annex A and Article VII to be satisfied; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall
not limit or otherwise affect the remedies of Parent or the Company available
hereunder and no information delivered pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall
update any section of the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure
Letter or shall affect the representations or warranties of the parties
hereunder.

Section 6.6 Access to Information.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, the Company shall afford to Parent and its Affiliates
and its and their officers, agents, control persons, employees, consultants,
professional advisers (including attorneys, accountants and financial
advisors) ("Representatives"), during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time, reasonable access (including for the purpose of
coordinating transition planning with employees and conducting Phase I
environmental site assessments) to all its and its Subsidiaries' properties,
books, contracts, commitments and records, and to its and its Subsidiaries'
officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other Representatives and,
during such period, the Company shall promptly make available to the



Parent, subject, in the case of competitively sensitive information, to any
"clean-room" arrangements agreed between the Parties, (i) a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received
by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities
Laws and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as the Parent may reasonably request.

(b) No investigation by Parent or its Representatives shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company set forth
herein.

(c) This Section 6.6 shall not require the Company to permit any access, or to
disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith judgment of the
Company is competitively sensitive, would reasonably be expected to result in
any violation of any material Contract or Law to which the Company or its
Subsidiaries is a party or is subject or cause any privilege (including
attorney-client privilege) which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would
be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to such information if
such undermining of such privilege could in the Company's good faith judgment
adversely affect in any material respect the Company's position in any pending
or reasonably probable future litigation; provided, that the Parties shall
cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information to
the extent doing so (1) would not (in the good faith belief of the Company)
reasonably be likely to result in the violation of any such material Contract
or Law or reasonably be likely to cause such privilege to be undermined with
respect to such information or (2) could reasonably (in the good faith belief
of the Company) be managed through the use of any "clean-room" arrangements
agreed between the Parties pursuant to which non-employee Representatives of
Parent shall be provided access to such information; provided, further, that
the Company shall (x) notify the Parent that such disclosures are reasonably
likely to violate the Company's or its Subsidiaries' obligations under any
such material Contract or Law or are reasonably likely to cause such privilege
to be undermined and (y) in the case where such disclosures are reasonably
likely to violate the Company's or its Subsidiaries' obligations under any
material Contract, use reasonable commercial efforts to seek consent from the
applicable third party to any such material Contract with respect to the
disclosures prohibited thereby (to the extent not otherwise expressly
prohibited by the terms of such Contract).

(d) Unless and until the Closing occurs, the information provided pursuant to
this Section 6.6 shall be kept confidential by the recipient thereof in
accordance with, and shall otherwise abide by and be subject to the terms and
conditions of, the Confidentiality Agreement, except that notwithstanding
Section 2 of the Confidentiality Agreement, (x) the Company and Parent may
disclose any of the terms, conditions or other facts of the Transactions and
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement if expressly permitted by
the terms of this Agreement; (y) notwithstanding Section 1 of the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Company shall have no further consent rights
with respect to Parent's selection of any potential source of debt financing
(and their respective representatives) or Parent's ability to share
Confidential Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) with
such debt financing sources (provided, that Parent shall provide prompt
written notice to the Company of any such debt financing sources with whom it
has shared Confidential Information) and (z) any such debt



financing sources shall be expressly included within the definition of
"Representatives" in the Confidentiality Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Parent agrees that
it will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, prior to the Effective
Time, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.6 for any
competitive or other purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
Transactions.

Section 6.7 Efforts.

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use
reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements
which may be imposed on such Party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the
Transactions and, subject to the conditions set forth in Annex A and Article
VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Transactions, as promptly as practicable and (ii) to obtain (and
to cooperate with the other Party to obtain) any consent, authorization, order
or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other
third Person which is required to be obtained by Parent or the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to comply with the
terms and conditions of any such consent, authorization, order or approval.
Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, promptly take any and all
steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all
consents under the HSR Act and any other applicable U.S. or foreign
competition, antitrust, merger control or investment Laws (together with the
HSR Act, "Antitrust Laws") that may be required by any foreign or U.S.
federal, state or local Governmental Entity, in each case with competent
jurisdiction, so as to enable the Parties to consummate the Transactions as
promptly as practicable, including committing to or effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate orders, trust, or otherwise, the sale or disposition of,
or prohibition or limitation on the ownership or operation by Parent and the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries of, such assets or businesses
as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of or vacate or lift, any Order, that would otherwise have the
effect of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of any of the
Transactions. Further, and for the avoidance of doubt, Parent will take any
and all actions necessary in order to ensure that (x) no requirement for any
non-action by or consent or approval of the FTC, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity with respect to any
Antitrust Laws, (y) no decree, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining
order or any other order in any suit or proceeding with respect to any
Antitrust Laws and (z) no other matter relating to any Antitrust Laws would
preclude consummation of the Offer or the Merger by the Outside Date.

(e) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, as soon as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, including using
reasonable best efforts to lift or rescind any injunction or



restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the
Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and using
reasonable best efforts to defend any litigation seeking to enjoin, prevent or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeking
material damages.

(f) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each Party
hereto shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable and in any event within seven (7) Business Days of
the date hereof, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, and to supply as
promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions consistent with this
Section 6.7 necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act (including any extensions thereof) as soon
as practicable and (ii) each of the Parent and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (x) take all action reasonably necessary to ensure
that no state takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (y) if any state
takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable to any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, take all action necessary to enable the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise minimize
the effect of such Law on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(g) Each of the Parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry by or before a Governmental Entity relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any governmental inquiry,
investigation or proceeding initiated by a private party, and (ii) keep the
other Party informed in all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis
of any communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to,
the FTC, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or any other
Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given by a private
Person in connection with any governmental inquiry, investigation or
proceeding, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Parent shall have the right to direct all matters with any
Governmental Entity consistent with its obligations hereunder. In addition,
Parent shall have the principal responsibility for devising and implementing
the strategy for obtaining any necessary antitrust or competition clearances
and shall take the lead in all meetings and communications with any
Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining any necessary antitrust or
competition clearances. In furtherance and not in limitation of this Section
6.7(d), subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
each Party shall consult and cooperate with the other Party in connection with
any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion
or proposal made or submitted in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or other legal proceeding. In addition, except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by Law, in connection with any such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or other legal proceeding, each Party
hereto shall permit authorized



Representatives of the other Party (x) to participate at or in each
substantive meeting, conference or telephone call with a representative of a
Governmental Entity relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or other legal proceeding and (y) to have reasonable access to and be
consulted in connection with any material document, opinion or proposal made
or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or other legal proceeding. Parent and the
Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section
6.7(d) as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained
therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient
and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or
directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance
from the source of the materials or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 6.7(d), materials provided to the
other Party or its outside counsel may be redacted to remove references
concerning the valuation, pricing and other competitively sensitive terms from
an antitrust perspective in the Contracts of Parent, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries.

Section 6.8 Indemnification.

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect of,
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor
of the current or former directors or officers of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective Constituent Documents or any
indemnification or similar agreements shall survive the Transactions and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to comply therewith. For a period of no
less than six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification
and advancement of expenses provisions of the Company's Constituent Documents
or any indemnification or similar agreements, in the form that is in effect as
of the date of this Agreement, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify
any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who immediately before the Effective Time were
current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company; provided,
however, that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses in respect of any Proceeding pending or asserted or any claim made
within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such
Proceeding.

(b) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties, rights and other assets to any Person, then, and in each
such case, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause
proper provision to be made so that such successor or assign shall expressly
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.

(c) Prior to the Acceptance Time the Company may, and if the Company does not,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of immediately following the



Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay for, at no expense to the
beneficiaries, non-cancellable "tail" insurance policies with a claims period
of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from insurance
carriers with the same or better credit ratings as the Company's current
insurance carriers with respect to directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively,
"DandO Insurance"), for the persons who are covered by the Company's existing
DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at
least as favorable to the insured individuals as the Company's existing DandO
Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby); provided, however, that in no event shall
the Company pay, or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, be required
to pay, for such "tail" insurance policies a one-time premium in excess of
300% of the Company's current annual premium for DandO Insurance as of June 8,
2014 (the "Premium Cap"). If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any
reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, at no expense to the
beneficiaries, DandO Insurance for a period of at least six years from and after
the Effective Time for the persons who are covered by the Company's existing
DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at
least as favorable as provided in such existing DandO Insurance, from insurance
carriers with the same or better claims-paying ability ratings as the
Company's current DandO Insurance carriers; provided, however, that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay for such DandO Insurance an
annual premium in excess of Premium Cap, in which case the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in effect, at no expense to the
beneficiaries, for a period of at least six years from the Effective Time for
the persons who are covered by the Company's existing DandO Insurance, DandO
Insurance with the best overall terms, conditions, retentions and levels of
coverage reasonably available for an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.8 shall survive consummation of the
Transactions, are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each Party entitled to indemnification hereunder, his or her heirs and his
or her representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may
have by Contract or otherwise.

Section 6.9 Financing.

(j) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Commitment Letter and shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, any replacement of all or a portion of any
facilities (or commitments thereof) described in, or any waiver of any
provisions under, the Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of
the Company, if such amendment, modification, replacement or waiver (i)
reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing to an amount below the amount
required, to consummate the Transactions and to repay or refinance the debt
contemplated to be replaced by the Commitment Letter, including the



payment of all fees, premiums and expenses associated therewith, (ii) imposes
additional conditions or any contingencies or otherwise expands upon, amends
or otherwise modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of any portion of
the Financing in a manner that would or would reasonably be expected to make
any portion of the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions
to obtaining the Financing) less likely to be obtained, (iii) prevents,
impedes or delays the occurrence of Closing, (iv) adversely impacts the
ability of Parent to enforce its rights against any other party to the
Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements or (v) adversely impacts the
ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. For the
avoidance of doubt, but subject to the foregoing, Parent may amend,
supplement, modify or replace the Commitment Letter as in effect at the date
hereof (x) to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of
the date of this Agreement or (y) to increase the amount of indebtedness.
Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, (a) issue
or sell any debt securities, incur debt for borrowed money or issue any equity
securities or equity-linked securities, in each case the effect of which is to
reduce the commitments under the Bridge Facility (as defined in the Commitment
Letter) unless (i) all lenders providing debt commitments and loans thereunder
are Investment Grade Lenders (as defined in the Commitment Letter) and (ii)
the proceeds are placed in an escrow account and not released therefrom until
either used for Financing of the Transactions or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, (b) will not obtain commitments
for, or obtain loans under, any term loan facility or term bank debt the
effect of which is to reduce the commitments under the Bridge Facility (as
defined in the Commitment Letter) unless (i) the purpose of such loans is
solely to finance the Transactions, (ii) the conditions precedent to the
availability of such facility on the Offer Closing are not less favorable to
Parent than such conditions in the Bridge Facility and do not include any
conditions not set forth in the Condition Precedent Exhibit (as defined in the
Commitment Letter) and (iii) any proceeds from any such facility received
prior to the Offer Closing are placed in an escrow account and not released
therefrom until either used to finance the Transactions or the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII; or (c) consummate any sale or
disposition of assets the effect of which is to reduce the commitments under
the Bridge Facility unless the proceeds are placed in an escrow account and
not released therefrom until either used for the Financing of the Transactions
or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII. For
purposes of this Agreement, (1) the term "Financing" shall be deemed to
include the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as amended,
modified or replaced pursuant to this Section 6.9 (including any Alternative
Financing used to satisfy the obligations under this Agreement), and (2) the
term "Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include the Commitment Letter as
may be amended or modified pursuant to this Section 6.9 and any commitment
letters with respect to the Alternative Financing. Parent acknowledges and
agrees that neither the obtaining of the Financing or any Alternative
Financing is a condition to Parent's obligations to consummate the
Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(k) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best
efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter



pursuant to its terms (except for amendments not prohibited by Section 6.9(a))
until the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, (ii) negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing on the terms and
conditions contained in the Commitment Letter (including any "flex"
provisions) or on other terms not materially less favorable, in the aggregate,
to Parent (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) than the terms
and conditions contained in the Commitment Letter (such definitive agreements,
the "Definitive Agreements"), and do not expand upon the conditions precedent
set forth in the Commitment Letter in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to make any portion of the funding of the Financing less likely to be
obtained or prevent, impede or delay the funding of the Financing and, upon
execution thereof, deliver a copy thereof to the Company, (iii) satisfy (or,
if deemed advisable by Parent, seek a waiver on a timely basis of) all
covenants, other obligations and conditions to funding in the Commitment
Letter that are required to be satisfied by it and, in the event that all
conditions to funding in the Commitment Letter and the Definitive Agreements
are satisfied at or prior to Offer Closing, consummate the Financing at the
Offer Closing in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Commitment
Letter as in effect at or prior to the Offer Closing and (iv) so long as the
conditions in the immediately preceding clause (iii) have been satisfied, take
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce its rights under the Commitment
Letter and the Definitive Agreements in the event of a failure to fund by the
Financing Sources that prevents, impedes or delays the Offer Closing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained
in this Section 6.9(b) shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable
best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require, either
Parent or Merger Sub to pay any material fees in excess of those contemplated
by the Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter.

(l) In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter or Parent becomes aware
of any event or circumstance that makes any portion of the Financing
unavailable, in each case, on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Commitment Letter and such portion is reasonably required to consummate the
Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent
shall promptly notify the Company and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange alternative financing from the same or alternative sources in an
amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement (the "Alternative Financing") and all references to Financing shall
be deemed to include such Alternative Financing and all references to the
Commitment Letter and Definitive Documents shall include the applicable
documents for the Alternative Financing; provided however, that Parent shall
not be required to obtain financing which includes terms and conditions less
favorable (taking into account any "market flex" provision) to Parent, in each
case relative to those in the Financing being replaced. Parent shall give the
Company prompt oral and written notice of any material breach or default by
any party to the Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreements of which Parent
becomes aware or any termination or waiver, amendment or other modification of
the Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreements. Parent shall keep the Company
reasonably informed of the status of its effort to arrange the Financing and
shall provide to the Company copies of all material, final definitive
documents related to the Financing (excluding fee letters, except to the
extent that such documents contain any conditions to funding or other
substantive provisions regarding the terms and conditions of the Financing).
In the event that Parent commences an enforcement action to



enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements
and/or cause the Financing Sources to fund the Financing, Parent shall keep
the Company reasonably informed of the status of such enforcement action.

(m) The Company shall, shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to,
provide to Parent the following information at least 30 days prior to the
Acceptance Time (the "Information Delivery Date"), in each case to the extent
not otherwise publicly available by the Information Delivery Date:

(i) unaudited consolidated and consolidating balance sheets and related
statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries for each fiscal quarter (other than the fourth
quarter) ended subsequent to June 29, 2013 and at least 40 days prior to the
Information Delivery Date and the comparable period in the prior fiscal year;
and

(ii) audited consolidated and consolidating balance sheets of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries for the two most recently completed fiscal years, and
related audited statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the three most recently completed
fiscal years, in each case ended at least 60 days prior to the Information
Delivery Date;

provided that, if a fiscal quarter ends after such 40th day or if a fiscal
year ends after such 60th day and in each case prior to the anticipated
Acceptance Time, then the Company shall, shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives to, provide to Parent the financial information referred to in
clause (i) or (ii) above, as applicable, at or prior to such time as it is
required to file such financial information with the SEC.

In addition, from and after entry into this Agreement, the Company shall,
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause its and their respective Representatives to, cooperate with Parent in
the preparation of customary pro forma financial statements of Parent that
meet the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act and all other
accounting rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder and
required to be included in a Registration Statement under the Securities Act
on Form S-3 ("Pro Forma Financial Statements"), to the extent the Company's
and the Company Subsidiaries' cooperation relates to financial information and
data derived from the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' historical books
and records, and to assist Parent in obtaining from the Company's independent
accountants a customary comfort letter with respect to the financial
information provided pursuant to this subsection (d) and their consent to use
such financial information (including their audit reports with respect to the
financial information referred to in clause (ii) above) in a Registration
Statement under the Securities Act on Form S-3.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company in good faith reasonably
believes that it has delivered the information requested by this Section
6.9(d), it may deliver to the Parent a written notice to that effect (stating
when it believes it completed any such delivery), in which case the



Company shall be deemed to have delivered such information required by this
Section 6.9(d) as of the date of delivery of such notice unless the Parent in
good faith reasonably believes that the Company has not completed delivery of
such information and, within five Business Days after the delivery of such
notice to the Company, the Parent delivers a written notice to the Company to
that effect (stating with specificity which information the Company has not
delivered).

(n) Parent shall promptly (i) upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable out of pocket costs (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives in connection with the cooperation of the
Company and Company Subsidiaries and their Representatives contemplated by
this Section 6.9 and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties (collectively, the "Liabilities") suffered or incurred
by any of them in connection with any claims asserted by Financing Sources in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing (other than to the extent
such Liabilities arise from the willful misconduct of or breach of this
Agreement by the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives) and any information used in connection therewith. All non-
public or other confidential information provided by the Company to Parent,
its Representatives or its Financing Sources pursuant to this Section 6.9
shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement,
except that Parent shall be permitted to disclose such information to rating
agencies and prospective lenders or prospective investors (including by filing
with the SEC in a Registration Statement on Form S-3 or otherwise the audited
and unaudited financial statements referred to in subsection (d) of this
Section 6.9 and the Pro Forma Financial Statements) during syndication or
marketing of any financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter, subject to
ordinary and customary confidentiality undertakings.

(o) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Financing (or any Alternative
Financing) is not a condition to consummation of the Transactions, and that,
irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing or any
Alternative Financing, Parent and Merger Sub shall be obligated to pay for
tendered Shares in the Offer and consummate the Merger (and pay the Merger
Consideration) and the other Transactions as provided herein, subject only to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Annex A with respect
to the Offer and the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII.

Section 6.10 Employee Benefit Plans.

(c) Effective as of the Acceptance Time, each Company Stock Option that is
unexpired, unexercised and outstanding, whether vested or unvested,
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, shall become vested in full as of
immediately before the Acceptance Time and shall be cancelled in exchange for
the right to receive a cash payment from Parent at the Acceptance Time to the
holder thereof equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to the Company Stock Option multiplied by the excess, if any, of (1) Offer
Price, over (2) the per share exercise price for such option.



(d) Effective as of the Acceptance Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall become vested in full as
of immediately before the Acceptance Time and shall be cancelled in exchange
for the right to receive a cash payment from Parent at the Acceptance Time to
the holder thereof equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Company RSU multiplied by the Offer Price. For purposes of this
Section 6.10(b), any and all performance-based vesting conditions applicable
to any Company RSUs will be deemed vested at target performance levels.

(e) Parent and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any former holder of a Company
Stock Option or Company RSU pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax
Law. Any amount deducted or withheld pursuant to this Section 6.10(c) shall be
treated as having been paid to the holder of such Company Stock Option or
Company RSU, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made. Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all amounts so deducted or withheld to
the appropriate taxing authority within the period required under applicable
Law.

(f) No later than ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement,
the Company will provide Parent with a true and complete list of all
outstanding Company Stock Options and Company RSUs, including with respect to
each such award, as applicable, the holder, date of grant, exercise price,
vesting schedule, expiration date and number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject thereto.

(g) For a period commencing on the Effective Time, and ending on the second
anniversary of the Closing Date (or, such shorter period of employment, as the
case may be) each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than
employees whose terms and conditions of employment are governed by a
collective bargaining agreement) who remains employed by the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries (the "Continuing Employees") shall receive
from Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) an annual rate of salary or wages
that is no less favorable than the annual rate of salary or wages provided to
such employee by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time; (ii) incentive opportunities that are no less
favorable than the incentive opportunities provided to such employee by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time; and (iii) employee benefits that are no less favorable than the employee
benefits provided to such employee by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(h) Without limiting the foregoing, for a period commencing on the Effective
Time, and ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall provide or cause to be provided,
to each Continuing Employee severance benefits that are no less favorable than
the severance payments and benefits for which such Continuing Employee was
eligible immediately prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting the
foregoing, for a period commencing on the Effective Time, and ending on



the second anniversary of the Closing Date, any Continuing Employee who (i) is
required by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to relocate to a work location that is 50 miles or more from such
employee's work location in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; or
(ii) is assigned by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to a work status representing a reduction of more than
30% in the Continuing Employee's weekly work schedule in effect as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall (in the absence of just cause
for termination by the employer) be entitled to resign, with such resignation
treated for all purposes as a termination without cause or otherwise as a
termination entitling such employee to receive the severance payments and
benefits in accordance with this Section 6.10(f).

(i) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor all obligations under all Company
Benefit Plans, compensation, retention and severance arrangements and
agreements, and collective bargaining agreements, in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, provided that such
requirement shall not conflict with the obligations set forth in Section
6.10(e), Section 6.10(f) or this Section 6.10(g). Subject to Section 409A of
the Code, Parent and the Company hereby agree that a "change of control" or
"change in control" within the meaning of each Company Benefit Plan (or an
event of similar effect under the terms of such Company Benefit Plan) will
occur upon the Closing or the Acceptance Time, as applicable.

(j) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to each
Continuing Employee payment with respect to such employee's annual bonus under
the Company's Annual Incentive Plan for the Company's fiscal year 2014 and
fiscal year 2015 in accordance with the terms set forth on Section 6.10(h) of
the Company Disclosure Letter.

(k) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation, and any of its respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective
third party insurance providers or third party administrators to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to waive all limitations as to any pre-
existing condition or waiting periods in its applicable welfare plans with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each
Continuing Employee under any welfare plans that such employees may be
eligible to participate in after the Effective Time and to credit each
Continuing Employee for any copayments, deductibles, offsets or similar
payments made under any employee benefit plan of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary during the plan year which includes the Closing Date for purposes
of satisfying any applicable copayment, deductible, offset or similar
requirements under the comparable plans of Parent, Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries. In addition, as of the Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any applicable
Company Subsidiary to, give Continuing Employees full credit for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and determination of level of benefits under any employee
benefit and compensation plans or arrangements maintained by Parent or an
applicable Parent Subsidiary that such employees may be eligible to
participate in after the Effective Time for such Continuing Employees' service
with the Company or any Company Subsidiaries to the same extent that such
service was credited for purposes of any comparable employee benefit plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than for benefit accruals under
defined benefit pension plans or eligibility for early



retirement benefits or post-retirement welfare benefits and in no event shall
service prior to the Effective Time be required to be taken into account if
such service credit would result in the duplication of benefits with respect
to the same period).

(l) Effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Acceptance
Time, contingent upon the Acceptance Time, each of the Company, its
Subsidiaries and any ERISA Affiliate shall take all actions necessary to
terminate each Company Benefit Plan that is a defined contribution plan
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (each a "Company DC
Plan") and to provide that each participant shall become fully vested in any
unvested portion of their accounts under any applicable Company DC Plan.
Effective as of or as soon as reasonably practicable following the Acceptance
Time, Parent shall establish or designate a defined contribution pension plan
(the "Parent DC Plan") that shall accept the direct rollover of distributions
from any Company DC Plan to participants in such Company DC Plan, including
in-kind distributions of loan notes. Parent and its Affiliates shall take
whatever actions are necessary to ensure that the Parent DC Plan accepts the
in-kind rollover of participant loans from the Company DC Plans to the Parent
DC Plan, as described in the preceding sentence. Parent shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that such employees have the opportunity to continue to
make scheduled loan payments pending the rollover of the notes evidencing such
loans. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall adopt, contingent upon
the Closing, such resolutions and/or amendments (and take any other required
action) to (i) amend the portion of any Company DC Plan that is intended to
constitute an employee stock ownership plan, as defined in Code section
4975(e)(7) (each an "ESOP") to provide that (A) any cash remaining in the ESOP
suspense account upon repayment of exempt ESOP loans, as described in Code
section 4975(d)(3), the proceeds of which were used to acquire the Shares held
in the ESOP suspense account (the "ESOP Loans") in connection with the
termination of the ESOP be allocated to the accounts of the ESOP participants
who have account balances in the ESOP in proportion to the participant's
compensation and (B) all distributions of ESOP account balances made following
the termination of the ESOP be in the form of cash only, (ii) terminate the
ESOP, and (iii) cause (A) the aggregate Offer Price received by the ESOP
trustee in connection with the Offer or the Merger with respect to the
unallocated Shares held in the ESOP trust to first be applied by the ESOP
trustee to the full repayment of the ESOP Loans and (B) any cash remaining in
the ESOP suspense account after the repayment of the ESOP Loans as described
in clause (iii)(A) above to be allocated to the accounts of the ESOP
participants who have account balances in the ESOP in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the ESOP, as amended, as described in clause (i)(A)
above. As soon as practicable following the Acceptance Time, Parent shall
distribute, or cause to be distributed, the account balances of all Company DC
Plans participants and their beneficiaries in cash in accordance with the
terms of the Company DC Plans, as amended as described in clause (i)(B) above.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, for purposes of
measuring comparability under this Section 6.10, the Parent DC Plan shall be
deemed to be comparable in all respects to the Company DC Plan and the ESOP.

(m) [Reserved]

(n) No provision of this Section 6.10 shall be construed as a limitation on
the right of Parent, or to cause any Parent Subsidiary to, amend or terminate
any specific



employee benefit plan that Parent or a Parent Subsidiary would otherwise have
under the terms of such employee benefit plan, nor shall any provision of this
Section 6.10 be construed to require the continuation of the employment of any
particular Continuing Employee. The provisions of this Section 6.10 are solely
for the benefit of the Parties to this Agreement, and no current or former
director, officer, employee or independent contractor or any other Person
shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Section 6.10 of this Agreement, and
nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any employee benefit plan
of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or other compensation or benefit plan or
arrangement for any purpose.

Section 6.11 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions

Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law.

Section 6.12 Litigation. In the event that any litigation related to this
Agreement, the Transactions or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is brought against the Company and/or its directors by security
holders of the Company, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of such
litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis with
respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, in, but not
control, the defense and settlement of any such litigation against the Company
and/or its directors by security holders of the Company and no such settlement
shall be agreed to by the Company or any Company Subsidiary without Parent's
prior written consent.

Section 6.13 Pinnacle Termination Fee. Concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company, (a) the Company shall terminate the
Pinnacle Merger Agreement (if it has not previously been terminated) and (b)
Parent shall pay to the Company (or, at the direction of the Company, to
Pinnacle Foods Inc. on behalf of the Company), the amount of the fee
negotiated to terminate the Pinnacle Merger Agreement (the "Pinnacle
Termination Fee") by wire transfer of immediately available funds; provided
that, without Parent's prior written consent, such fee shall not exceed
$163,000,000, payment of which shall be conditioned upon receipt of a full and
complete release by Pinnacle Foods Inc. of Parent, the Company and their
respective Affiliates, officers, directors and employees from any and all
liabilities arising under or relating to the Pinnacle Merger Agreement, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby or hereby ("Pinnacle
Release"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Pinnacle Release shall be
required if the Pinnacle Merger Agreement terminates other than pursuant to
Section 7.1(a) thereof.

Section 6.14 Section 14d-10(d) Matters. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company (acting through the Company Board) shall take all such steps as may be
required to cause each agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into by
the Company or its Subsidiaries as of or after the date hereof with any of its
officers, directors or employees pursuant



to which consideration is paid to such officer, director or employee to be
approved as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act
and to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in
Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.15 Dividends. If the Company has declared and set a record date for
a regular quarterly cash dividend permitted under the terms of this Agreement,
and the Effective Time occurs after the record date for such dividend and
prior to the payment date for such dividend, then Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall pay such dividend (and any applicable dividend equivalent
rights to the extent any holder of a Company RSU was entitled to such rights
under the terms of a Company RSU as in effect on the date the Company declared
the applicable dividend) on behalf of the Company following the Closing on the
scheduled payment date for such dividend.

necessary to (a) cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and (b) ensure that, prior to the

and there shall not be any liability or obligation on the part of any Party
hereto, other than this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Article IX which
provisions shall survive such termination; provided, however, that, except as
set forth in Section 8.3(f), no such termination shall relieve any Party from
liability for any fraud or Willful Breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement, in which case the
aggrieved Party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law
or in equity, including, in the case of a breach by Parent or Merger Sub,
liability to the Company for damages, determined taking into account all
relevant factors, including, without duplication, the loss of the benefit of
the Transactions to the Company, the lost stockholder premium, the time value
of money, and any benefit to Parent or its stockholders arising from such
breach. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the
Parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations
shall survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms
(and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 9.6).

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.3 (or otherwise as
expressly provided in this Agreement) and except for the filing fee under the
HSR Act and any fees for similar filings or notices under foreign Laws or
regulations (which such fees shall be paid by Parent in each case but, in the
event this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, borne equally
by Parent and the Company (with the Company reimbursing Parent for its 50%
share of such fees promptly following such termination)), all fees and
expenses incurred by the Parties hereto shall be borne solely by the Party
that has incurred such fees and expenses.

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to

(e) [Reserved].

(f) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to

each case prior to or concurrently with such termination.



(g) In the event that after the date hereof, (i) a Takeover Proposal shall
have been publicly disclosed, announced or otherwise made public by any Person
(other than Parent or any of its Affiliates) (a "Company Takeover Proposal"),
(ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii), Section
8.1(b)(iii) or Section 8.1(d)(ii) (if the breach giving rise to such
termination pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) was a Willful Breach) and at the
time of such termination the Company Takeover Proposal has not been withdrawn
and remains outstanding, and (iii) within nine (9) months after any such
termination referred to in the preceding clause (ii), the Company enters into
any definitive agreement providing for any transaction contemplated by any
Company Takeover Proposal (regardless of when made after the date hereof and
whether or not the same Company Takeover Proposal referred to in the preceding
clause (i), which transaction is thereafter consummated (regardless of when
consummated)) or consummates any transaction contemplated by any Company
Takeover Proposal (regardless of when made after the date hereof and whether
or not the same Company Takeover Proposal referred to in the preceding clause
(i)), then, the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee and,
shall reimburse to Parent the Pinnacle Reimbursement Fee, in each case
concurrently with the occurrence of the consummation of any Company Takeover
Proposal referred to in the preceding clause (iii); provided, however, that
for purposes of the definition of "Takeover Proposal" in this Section 8.3(e),
references to "20%" shall be replaced by "50%."

(h) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due
pursuant to this Section 8.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for any amount
due pursuant to this Section 8.3, the Company shall pay Parent its costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amount due pursuant to this
Section 8.3 from the date such payment was required to be made until the date
of payment at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall Street Journal
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement (subject to Section 9.12), (i) if
Parent receives or is entitled to receive the Company Termination Fee and the
Pinnacle Reimbursement Fee pursuant to this Section 8.3, such payment shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub hereunder, and upon
payment of the Company Termination Fee and the Pinnacle Reimbursement Fee, the
Company shall have no further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) if Parent
or Merger Sub receives any payments from the Company in respect of any breach
of this Agreement, and thereafter Parent is entitled to receive the Company
Termination Fee and the Pinnacle Reimbursement Fee pursuant to this Section
8.3, the aggregate of the Company Termination Fee and the Pinnacle
Reimbursement Fee payable pursuant to this Section 8.3 shall be reduced by the
aggregate amount of any payments made by the Company to Parent or Merger Sub
in respect of any such breaches of this Agreement, (iii) under no
circumstances shall Parent or Merger Sub, taken together, be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance pursuant to Section
9.12 to cause the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
money damages, including all or any portion of the Company Termination Fee or
Pinnacle Reimbursement Fee, (iv) under no circumstances shall the Company, be
permitted or entitled to



receive both a grant of specific performance pursuant to Section 9.12 to cause
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and money damages
with respect to the same matter at issue and (v) in no event shall the
Company's liability for monetary damages to Parent or Merger Sub with respect
to any breach (whether a Willful Breach or otherwise) by the Company of
Section 6.3 exceed an amount equal to the sum of the Company Termination Fee
plus the Pinnacle Reimbursement Fee. All payments under this Section 8.3 shall
be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Parent. In no event shall a Company Termination Fee
be payable more than once and in no event shall a Pinnacle Reimbursement Fee
be payable more than once.

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER



Capitalized terms used in this Annex A and not otherwise defined shall have
the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the "Agreement") to which this Annex A is attached.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or the Agreement, Merger Sub
shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub
to, accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of

Expiration Time any of the following conditions exists or has occurred and is
continuing at the then scheduled Expiration Time:

(a) there shall not have been validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn)
prior to the Expiration Time a number of Shares (excluding Shares tendered
pursuant to notices of guaranteed delivery for which Shares have not been
delivered) that, together with the Shares beneficially owned by Parent and
Merger Sub, represents at least two-thirds (2/3) of the total number of
outstanding Shares of the Company as of the Expiration Time (the "Minimum
Condition");

(b) the waiting period (and any extensions thereof) under the HSR Act shall
not have expired or been terminated;

(c) any Law or Order shall be in effect that prohibits, enjoins or makes
illegal the consummation of the Offer;

(d) (i) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the
Agreement (except those representations and warranties set forth in clause
(ii) below) shall not be true and correct in all respects (without giving
effect to any materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifier
therein), as of the date of the Agreement and as of the Expiration Time as
though made on or as of such time (or, in the case of representations and
warranties that address matters only as of a particular date, as of such
date), except to the extent that breaches thereof, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect; and (ii) the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in Sections 4.2(a), 4.2(b) and 4.6(b) shall not be true and
correct in all material respects (in the case of Sections 4.2(a) and 4.2(b))
and in all respects (in the case of Section 4.6(b)) as of the date of the
Agreement and as of the Expiration Time as though made on or as of such time
(or, in the case of representations and warranties that address matters only
as of a particular date, as of such date). Parent and Merger Sub shall not
have received a certificate validly executed and signed on behalf of the
Company by its chief executive officer and chief financial officer certifying
that this condition has been satisfied; 

(e) the Company shall not have performed or complied with, as applicable, in
all material respects, all of the obligations, agreements and covenants (in
each case, other than Section 6.5) required by the Agreement to be performed
or complied with by the Company prior to the Expiration Time, and such failure
to perform or comply shall not have been cured prior to the Expiration Time,
and Parent and Merger Sub shall not have received a certificate validly
executed and signed on behalf of the Company by its chief executive officer
and chief financial officer certifying that this condition has been satisfied;

(f) since June 29, 2013, there shall have occurred any event, change, effect,
development, state of facts, condition, circumstance or occurrence that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

(g) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms; or

(h) between the date of the execution of this Agreement by Parent (the
"Execution Date") and the date of execution of this Agreement by the Company,
the Company shall have performed or complied with, as applicable, in all
material respects, all of the obligations, agreements and covenants required
by Section 6.1 of the Agreement as if such obligations, agreements and
covenants were effective as of the Execution Date and such failure to perform
or comply shall be material and adverse to Parent and shall not have been
cured prior to the Expiration Time, and Parent and Merger Sub shall not have
received a certificate validly executed and signed on behalf of the Company by
its chief executive officer and chief financial officer certifying that this
condition has been satisfied.

Subject in each case to the terms of the Agreement and the applicable rules
and regulations of the SEC, the foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit
of Merger Sub and Parent and may be asserted by Merger Sub or Parent
regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such condition, or may (if
permitted by applicable Law) be waived (other than the Minimum Condition which
may not be waived) by Merger Sub and Parent as a whole or in part at any time
and from time to time in their sole discretion.
