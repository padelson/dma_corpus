iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of January 26,
2011, is entered into between Susquehanna Bancshares, Inc., a Pennsylvania
corporation ("Parent"), and Abington Bancorp, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation
(the "Company"). Parent and the Company are sometimes collectively referred to
herein as the "Constituent Corporations."

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their
shareholders to consummate the business combination transaction provided for
herein in which the Company will, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, merge (the "Merger") with and into Parent;

WHEREAS, as soon as practicable after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Susquehanna Bank, a bank and trust company organized under the
Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965 and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the
"Parent Bank"), and Abington Savings Bank, a savings bank organized under the
Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965 and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company (the "Company Bank"), will enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the "Bank Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company Bank shall merge
with and into the Parent Bank (the "Bank Merger"), with the Parent Bank
constituting the surviving bank (the "Surviving Bank"), and it is intended
that the Bank Merger be consummated immediately following the consummation of
the Merger; and

 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (the "PBCL"), at the
Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof), the Company shall merge
with and into Parent. Parent shall be the surviving corporation (hereinafter
sometimes called the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger, and shall
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall continue to be
Susquehanna Bancshares, Inc. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of the Company shall cease.

 



1 1.2 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, articles of
merger complying with the PBCL (the "Articles of Merger") shall be duly
prepared, executed and delivered for filing with the Department of State of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the "Department"), in each case on the
Closing Date (as defined in Section 10.1 hereof). The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Articles of Merger are filed by the Department
or at such later time as may be specified in the Articles of Merger (such time
being the "Effective Time").

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in Section 1929 of the PBCL.

1.4 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, subject to the other provisions of this Article I,
and Sections 2.2(e) and Section 9.1(g) hereof, each share of the common
stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares of Company Common Stock held directly or indirectly by Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (as defined below) (except for
Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares, as such terms are defined in Section
1.4(c) hereof)) shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and exchangeable for the
right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration (as defined below). The Per
Share Stock Consideration is also referred to herein as the "Merger
Consideration." 

For purposes of this Agreement:

"Per Share Stock Consideration" shall mean a number of shares of common stock,
par value $2.00 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") equal to the
Exchange Ratio.

 

"Exchange Ratio" shall mean 1.32.

All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
a certificate (each a "Certificate") previously representing any such shares
of Company Common Stock or owner of a book entry previously representing a
non-certificated share of Company Common Stock (a "Book-Entry Share") shall
thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities, except
the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) any dividends and
other distributions in accordance with Section 2.2(b) hereof, and (iii) any
cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with Section 2.2(e) hereof.

If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be changed into a different number or class of
shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or a stock dividend thereon
shall be declared with a record date within such

 



2  period, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the Per Share Stock
Consideration. In the event that Parent enters into an agreement pursuant to
which shares of Parent Common Stock would be converted, prior to the
Effective Time, into shares or other securities or obligations of another
corporation, proper provision shall be made in such agreement, so that each
Company shareholder shall be entitled to receive at the Effective Time
such number of shares or other securities or amount of obligations of such
other corporation as such shareholder would be entitled to receive if the
Effective Time had occurred immediately prior to the consummation of such
conversion.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned
directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (other than shares of Company Common Stock (x) held directly or
indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise held
in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of third parties, including
all shares of Company Common Stock held in connection with the Company Banks
employee stock ownership plan (such plan and the trust related thereto, the
"ESOP"), the Companys Amended and Restated 2005 Recognition and Retention
Plan and Trust Agreement ("2005 RRP") and 2007 Recognition and Retention Plan
and Trust Agreement ("2007 RRP") and the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement
for Deferred Compensation and Retirement Plans of Abington Bank (any
such shares, and shares of Parent Common Stock which are similarly held,
whether held directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, being referred to herein as "Trust Account Shares") and (y) held by Parent
or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in respect of a debt
previously contracted (any such shares of Company Common Stock, and shares of
Parent Common Stock which are similarly held, whether held directly or
indirectly by Parent or the Company, being referred to herein as "DPC
Shares")) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no stock of Parent,
cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All
shares of Parent Common Stock that are owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall become
treasury stock of Parent.

1.5 _Option Plans; Stock Options_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each unexercised stock option outstanding to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Option") under the
Companys Amended and Restated 2005 Stock Option Plan (the "2005 Option Plan")
or 2007 Stock Option Plan ("2007 Option Plan," and together with the 2005
Option Plan, the "Company Option Plans"), and each Company Option Plan, shall
be assumed by Parent in a transaction described in Section 424(a) of the Code.
Each Company Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue
to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions of such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each Company
Option will be exercisable for that number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise
price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such

 



3  assumed Company Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company
Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, deliver to the holders of Company Options, notices
describing the conversion of such Company Options (as modified by this
Section 1.5(a)), and the agreements evidencing the Company Options shall
continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (as modified by this
Section 1.5(a)). Parent shall comply with the terms of all such Company
Options. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall reserve for issuance the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to satisfy Parents
obligations under this Section 1.5(a). As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement or statements on
Form S-8 or Form S-3 (or any successor form) with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to Company Options assumed by Parent pursuant
to this Agreement.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall take all such
steps as may be required to cause any acquisitions of Parent equity
securities (including derivative securities with respect to any Parent equity
securities) and dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities with respect to any Company equity securities)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is anticipated to be subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "Exchange Act"), with respect to Parent or who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

1.6 _Parent Common Stock_. Except for shares of Parent Common Stock owned by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account Shares and
DPC Shares), which shall be converted into treasury stock of Parent as
contemplated by Section 1.4 hereof, the shares of Parent Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be unaffected
by the Merger and such shares shall remain issued and outstanding.

1.7 _Articles of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the Articles of
Incorporation of Parent, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.8 _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Parent, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

1.9 _Directors and Officers_. 

(a) At and after the Effective Time, the directors of Parent shall consist of
all of the directors of Parent serving immediately prior to the Effective
Time and the additional persons who shall become directors of Parent in
accordance with Section 7.11 hereof, each to hold office in accordance with
the Articles of Incorporation 

 



4  and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

(b) The officers of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance
with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

1.10 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and that this Agreement shall constitute
a plan of reorganization for the purposes of Section 368 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder.

ARTICLE II 

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

2.1 _Parent to Make Shares and Cash Available_. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or
trust company (which may be a Subsidiary of Parent) (the "Exchange Agent")
selected by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company, for the benefit
of the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, for exchange in
accordance with this Article II, (i) certificates representing the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and Section 2.2(a) in
exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, and (ii) the cash in
lieu of fractional shares to be paid in accordance with Section 2.2(e)
hereof. Such cash and certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock, together
with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, are hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund."

 

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_. (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
and in no event more than three business days thereafter, the Exchange Agent
shall mail to each holder of record of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, a
form letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
The Company shall have the right to review both the letter of transmittal and
the instructions prior to the Effective Time and provide reasonable comments
thereon. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly executed letter
of transmittal, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder of Company
Common Stock became entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of Article
I hereof and/or (y) a check representing the amount of cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, which such holder has the right to receive in
respect of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered pursuant to the

 



5  provisions of Article I, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on the cash in lieu of fractional shares or the unpaid dividends and
distributions, if any, payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares.

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time
with respect to Parent Common Stock and payable to the holders of record
thereof shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Article II, the
record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or
other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had
become payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock represented by
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(c) If any certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition
of the issuance thereof that the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that
the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than
that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing such shares
are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock or cash
or both, as provided in this Article II.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no
dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable
on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Parent shall pay to each former shareholder of the Company who
otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the average of the
closing sale prices of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market as
reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five trading days immediately
preceding the date on which the Effective

 



6  Time shall occur by (ii) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section
1.4 hereof.

 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be
returned to Parent. Any shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment
of the Merger Consideration, the cash in lieu of fractional shares and/or the
unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the
Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Subject to Article III, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent
as follows:

4.1 _Corporate Organization_. (a) The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
Commonwealth of

 



7  Pennsylvania. The Company has the corporate power and authority to own or
lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be
licensed or qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined
below) on the Company. The Company is duly registered as a savings and loan
holding company under the Home Owners Loan Act, as amended. The Articles
of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company, copies of which have previously
been made available to Parent, are true and correct copies of such documents
as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the
term "Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect to Parent or the Company,
as the case may be, any event, change, circumstance, occurrence, effect or
state of facts that is or would reasonably be expected to be materially
adverse to (i) the business, results of operations or financial condition of
such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than any such effect
attributable to or resulting from (t) the announcement or pendency of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (u) any legal claims asserted or
other actions initiated by any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or
Parent Common Stock arising out of or related to this Agreement, (v) any

with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) the
ability of such party and its Subsidiaries to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(b) The Company Bank is a savings bank duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The deposit
accounts of the Company Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the "FDIC") to the fullest extent permitted by law, and all
premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been
paid when due. Each of the Companys other Subsidiaries is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of

Subsidiary. The articles of incorporation, bylaws and similar governing
documents of each Subsidiary of the Company, copies of which have previously
been made available to Parent, are true and correct copies of such documents
as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement,

other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is
consolidated with such party for financial reporting purposes.

whatsoever, and all of such shares or equity interests are duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No
Subsidiary of the Company has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling

the benefit of any employee or former employee, director or consultant of
Parent or any Subsidiary or with respect to which Parent or any Subsidiary has
any liability or obligation, contingent or otherwise.

5.12 _Taxes_. Except as may be set forth in Section 5.12 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, each of the Parent and its Subsidiaries has (i) duly and
timely filed (including applicable extensions granted without penalty) all
material Tax Returns required to be filed at or prior to the Effective Time,
and all such Tax Returns are true and correct in all material respects, and
(ii) paid in full or made adequate provision in the financial statements of
the Parent (in accordance with GAAP) for all Taxes required to be paid by
them, whether or not shown to be due on such Tax Returns. Except as set forth
in Section 5.12 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as of the date hereof (i)
neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has requested any extension of
time within which to file any Tax Returns in respect of any fiscal year which
have not since been filed and no request for waivers of the time to
assess any Taxes are pending or outstanding, (ii) with respect to each
taxable period of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, the federal and state
income Tax Returns of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been audited by the IRS
or appropriate state tax authorities through December 31, 2004 or the time
for assessing and collecting income Tax with respect to such taxable period
has closed and such taxable period is not subject to review and (iii) there
are no claims, audits or assessments pending against the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries for any alleged deficiency in Taxes, and the Parent has not been
notified in writing of any proposed Tax claims, audits or assessments against
the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than, in each case, claims,
audits or assessments for which adequate reserves in the financial statements
of the Parent have been established). There are no material liens for Taxes
upon the assets of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, other than liens
for current Taxes not yet due and payable. All Taxes required to be withheld,
collected or deposited by or with respect to the Parent and its Subsidiaries
have been timely withheld, collected or deposited, as the case may be, and, to
the extent required, have been paid to the relevant taxing authority. Neither
the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is required to include in income any
adjustment pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code (or any similar provision of
law or regulations) by reason of a change in accounting method.

5.13 _Parent Information_. The information relating to Parent and its
Subsidiaries to be contained in the Proxy Statement and the S-4, or in any
other document filed with any other regulatory agency in connection herewith,
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement
(except for such portions thereof that relate to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) will comply with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the
rules and

 



26  regulations thereunder. The S-4 will comply with the provisions of the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

 

5.14 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. The Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
holds all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the
lawful conduct of their respective businesses under and pursuant to all, and
have complied, in all material respects, with and are not in default in any
material respect under any, applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation,
policy and/or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to the Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, and neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received notice of any violations of any of the above.

 

5.15 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Except as may be set forth in
Section 5.15 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, neither the Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries is or since December 31, 2007 has been subject to any cease-
and-desist or other order issued by, or is a party to any Regulatory Agreement
whether or not set forth on Section 5.15 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
any Regulatory Agency that restricts the conduct of its business or that in
any manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit policies, its
management or its business, nor has the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries been advised by any Regulatory Agency that it is considering
issuing or requesting any Regulatory Agreement.

5.16  _Ownership of Company Common Stock; Affiliates and Associations_.

(a) Neither Parent nor any of its affiliates or associates (as such terms are
defined under the Exchange Act) (i) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly,
or (ii) is a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the
purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of any shares of capital
stock of the Company (other than Trust Account Shares or DPC shares); and

(b) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is an "interested shareholder"
of the Company (as such terms are defined in Section 2553 of the PBCL).

5.17 _Opinion_. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, Parent has received
an opinion from JPM to the effect that as of the date thereof and based upon
and subject to the matters set forth therein, the Exchange Ratio is fair,
from a financial point of view, to Parent.

5.18 _Approvals_. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent knows of no reason
why all regulatory approvals required for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) should not be obtained.

 

5.19 _Reorganization_. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason
to believe that the Merger will fail to qualify as a reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the Code.

approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all
necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and

approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities
which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Merger). The Company and Parent shall have
the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will
consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information, all the information which appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they
will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits,

Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein.

(c) Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or

date of this Agreement) from, or delivered by any of the foregoing to,
any Governmental Entity in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby.

7.2 _Access to Information_. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, each party shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees,

access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments, records, officers,
employees, accountants, counsel and other 

 



31  representatives and, during such period, it shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party all information concerning
its business, properties and personnel as the other party may reasonably
request. Neither party nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize
any attorney-client privilege or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) All information furnished by either party to the other pursuant to

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the other set forth herein.

7.3 _Certain Actions_. (a) Except with respect to this Agreement and the

accountants, advisors, agents, affiliates (as such term is used in Rule 12b-2
under the Exchange Act) or representatives (collectively, "Representatives")

action to facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) any
Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) or any inquiries with respect to or
the making of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to the

participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by any third party that is

or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) enter into any letter of intent or
similar document or any contract, agreement or commitment contemplating or
otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (v) fail to make, withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation to its shareholders
referred to in Section 7.4 hereof, or (vi) grant any waiver or release under
any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity
securities of the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company and
its Board of Directors shall be permitted (i) to comply with requirements
under Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard
to an Acquisition Proposal (provided that the Board of Directors of the
Company shall not withdraw or modify in an adverse manner its approval
recommendation referred to in Section 7.4 hereof except as set forth below),
(ii) to engage in any discussions or

 



32  negotiations with, or provide any information to, any person in response to
a Superior Proposal (as defined below) by any such person, if and only to the
extent that (x) the Companys Board of Directors concludes in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so would
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders
under applicable law, (y) prior to providing any information or data to any
person in connection with a Superior Proposal by any such person, the
Companys Board of Directors receives from such person an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreements (a copy of which executed
confidentiality agreement shall have been provided to Parent for informational
purposes), and (z) at least 72 hours prior to providing any information or
data to any person or entering into discussions or negotiations with any
person, the Company notifies Parent in writing promptly of such inquiries,
proposals or offers received by, any such information requested from, or any
such discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with,
any of its Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the
name of such person and the material terms and conditions of any inquiries,
proposals or offers, and (iii) to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent its recommendation to its shareholders referred to in Section 7.4
hereof in order to accept a Superior Proposal. The Company will promptly (and
in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing of the receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or any information related thereto, which notification
shall describe the Acquisition Proposal and identify the third party making
the same.

(c) The Company agrees that it will, and will cause its Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions, or
negotiations existing as of the date of this Agreement with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

(d) For purposes of this Section 7.3:

(i) The term "Acquisition Proposal" means any tender offer or exchange offer
or any proposal for a merger, acquisition of all of the stock or assets of,
or other business combination involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the acquisition of a substantial equity interest in, or a substantial
portion of the assets of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(ii) The term "Superior Proposal" means, with respect to the Company, any
bona-fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal made by a person other
than Parent which is on terms which the Board of Directors of the Company in
good faith concludes (after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside counsel), taking into account, among other things, all break-up fees,
expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation and all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making
the proposal, (A) is more favorable to its shareholders (in their capacities
as shareholders) than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and for
which financing, to the extent required, is then fully committed or reasonably
determined to be 

 



33  available by the Board of Directors of the Company, and (B) is reasonably
capable of being completed.

(e) If a Payment Event (as hereinafter defined) occurs, the Company shall pay
to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available funds), within two (2)
business days following such Payment Event, a fee of Eleven Million Dollars
($11,000,000) (the "Break-up Fee").

"Payment Event" means (x) the termination of this Agreement by Parent
pursuant to Section 9.1(f) (as a result of a breach by the Company of any of
its covenants under Section 7.3(a) or (c), or Section 7.4) or pursuant to
Section 9.1(h), or (y) the occurrence of any of the following events within
twelve (12) months of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.1(c), provided that an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made after the
date hereof and prior to such termination (which shall not have been
withdrawn in good faith prior to such termination): (i) the Company merges
with or into, or is acquired, directly or indirectly, by merger or otherwise
by, a Third Party; (ii) a Third Party, directly or indirectly acquires more
than 50% of the total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole; (iii) a Third Party, directly or indirectly, acquires more than 50% of
the outstanding Company Common Stock; or (iv) the Company adopts or
implements a plan of liquidation, recapitalization or share repurchase
relating to more than 50% of the outstanding Company Common Stock or an
extraordinary dividend relating to more than 50% of the outstanding Company
Common Stock or 50% of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole. As used herein, "Third Party" means any person as defined in
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act (other than Parent or its affiliates).

 

(f) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 7.3(e)
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and
that without these agreements Parent would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, in the event the Company fails to pay to Parent the Break-up Fee,
promptly when due, the Company shall, in addition thereto, pay to Parent all
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements) incurred in
collecting such Break-up Fee together with interest on the amount of the
Break-up Fee (or any unpaid portion thereof), from the date such payment was
due until the date such payment is received by Parent, accrued at the
fluctuating prime rate (as quoted in The Wall Street Journal) as in effect
from time to time during the period.

7.4 _Shareholder Meetings_. The Company and Parent each shall take all steps
necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
respective shareholders to be held as soon as is reasonably practicable after
the date on which the S-4 becomes effective for the purpose of voting upon the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Subject, in the case of the Company, to the right of the Company and
its Board of Directors to take action permitted by Section 7.3(b) with respect
to a Superior Proposal, the Company and Parent each will, through its
respective Board of Directors, recommend to its respective shareholders
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and such other matters as may be submitted to its shareholders in
connection with

 



34  this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall coordinate and cooperate with
respect to the foregoing matters, with a view towards, among other things,
holding the respective meetings of each partys shareholders on the same day.

7.5 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Each of Parent and the Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such party
or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions
set forth in Article VIII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to
obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption
by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party which is required to be
obtained by the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and to comply with the terms and conditions of such consent,
authorization, order or approval.

7.6 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market, subject to official notice
of issuance, as of the Effective Time.

7.7 _Employee Benefit Plans; Existing Agreements_. (a) Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall take all reasonable action so that employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries who become employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries
("Continuing Employees") shall be eligible to participate, effective as soon
as administratively practicable following the Effective Time, in each of the
Parent Plans in which similarly situated employees of Parent or its
Subsidiaries participate, to the same extent that similarly
situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries participate; provided,
however, that, in the case of all benefits then provided to the Continuing
Employees, until the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent may
instead provide such employees with participation in the employee benefit
plans of the Company in which they participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time, provided that the result is the provision of benefits to
Continuing Employees that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the
benefits provided to the employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries generally
(it being understood that inclusion of Continuing Employees in Parents
employee benefit plans may occur at different times with respect to
different plans). From and after the Effective Time, Parent may elect not to
provide to the Continuing Employees any benefits which are not then provided
by Parent and its Subsidiaries to their employees notwithstanding that such
benefits were provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to their employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) With respect to each Parent Plan for which length of service is taken
into account for any purpose, service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides past
service credit) shall be treated as service with Parent for purposes of
determining eligibility to participate, vesting, and entitlement to benefits,
including for severance benefits and

 



35  vacation entitlement (but not for accrual of defined benefit pension
benefits); provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Such
service also shall apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods,
evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of any preexisting
condition limitations, if permitted by the Parent Plan. If permitted by the
Parent Plan and subject to the requirements of applicable law, each Parent
Plan shall waive pre-existing condition limitations to the extent such
conditions are covered under the applicable Company Plan, and Continuing
Employees shall be given credit for amounts paid under a corresponding
benefit plan during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles,
copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Parent Plan. In the event of
a termination or consolidation of any health plan of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, terminated employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
qualified beneficiaries shall have the right to continued coverage under
group health plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries in accordance with COBRA.

(c) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume and honor and shall cause
the appropriate Subsidiaries of Parent to assume and to honor in accordance
with their terms all the Plans, to the extent the Plans are in effect as of
the Effective Time. Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Merger will
constitute a "change in control" of the Company for all purposes to the extent
applicable under the Plans.

7.8 _Indemnification_. (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior
to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the
"Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
(i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company,
any of the Subsidiaries of the Company or any of their
respective predecessors or affiliates or (ii) this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising
before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and
use their best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. It is
understood and agreed that after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify
and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent provided in the bylaws of the
Company, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation incurred by each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and in
the event of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective
Time), the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to
them after consultation with Parent; provided, however, that (1) Parent shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof and upon such assumption Parent
shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of 

 



36  other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent elects not
to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably
advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent
and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
reasonably satisfactory to them after consultation with Parent, and Parent
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties, (2) Parent shall in all cases be obligated pursuant to this paragraph

shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), (4) Parent shall
have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court

applicable law, and (5) Parent shall have no obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party in respect of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, cost,
expense, judgment or amount paid in settlements which arose out of or resulted

recklessness of the Indemnified Party. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
Indemnification under this Section 7.8, upon learning of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent
thereof, provided that the failure to so notify shall not affect the
obligations of Parent under this Section 7.8 except to the extent such failure
to notify materially prejudices Parent. Parents obligations under this
Section 7.8 shall continue in full force and effect without time limit from

Agreement shall be deemed to vary, limit or otherwise restrict any rights
or indemnification protections afforded to any Indemnified Party by the

(b) Parent shall cause the persons serving as officers and directors of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of
six years from the Effective Time by the directors and officers liability

containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous than such
policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time which were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as
such.

(c) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)

any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 7.8.

(d) The provisions of this Section 7.8 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives.

further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this

be converted into the Merger

 



39  Consideration and shall be allocated as earnings to the accounts of ESOP
participants who have account balances in the ESOP in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the ESOP. As soon as practicable after the date
hereof, the Company Bank shall file or cause to be filed all necessary
documents with the IRS for a determination letter for termination of the ESOP
as of the Effective Time, with a copy to be provided to the Parent and its
counsel. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Bank and, following the
Effective Time, the Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to obtain such favorable determination letter (including, but not limited to,
adopting such amendments to the ESOP as may be requested by the IRS as a
condition to its issuance of a favorable determination letter). As soon as
practicable following the later of the Effective Time or the receipt of a
favorable determination letter from the IRS regarding the qualified status of
the ESOP upon its termination, the account balances in the ESOP shall be
either distributed to participants and beneficiaries or transferred to an
eligible tax-qualified retirement plan or individual retirement account as a

immediately prior to the Effective Time. The accounts of all participants and
beneficiaries in the 401(k) Plan as of the Effective Time shall become fully
vested upon termination of the 401(k) Plan. As soon as practicable after the
date hereof, the Company Bank shall file or cause to be filed all necessary
documents with the IRS for a determination letter for termination of the
401(k) Plan as of or immediately prior to the Effective Time, with a copy to
be provided to the Parent and its counsel. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Bank and, following the Effective Time, the Parent shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain such favorable determination
letter (including, but not limited to, adopting such amendments to the 401(k)
Plan as may be requested by the IRS as a condition to its issuance of a
favorable determination letter. As soon as practicable following the later of
the Effective Time or the receipt of a favorable determination letter from
the IRS regarding the qualified status of the 401(k) Plan upon its
termination, the account balances in the 401(k) Plan shall be either
distributed to participants and beneficiaries or transferred to an eligible

to the Parent 401(k) Plan.

the Company and its Subsidiaries through the Effective Time. Subject to prior
consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), the Company will

ARTICLE IX

 

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the shareholders of both the Company and
Parent:

 



43 (a) by mutual consent of the Company and Parent in a written instrument, if
the Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the
members of its entire Board;

(b) by either Parent or the Company upon written notice to the other party
(i) 30 days after the date on which any request or application for a Requisite
Regulatory Approval shall have been denied or withdrawn at the request or
recommendation of the Governmental Entity which must grant such Requisite
Regulatory Approval, unless within the 30-day period following such denial or
withdrawal a petition for rehearing or an amended application has been filed
with the applicable Governmental Entity (provided, however, that no party
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.1(b)(i) if such denial or request or recommendation for withdrawal shall be
due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth
herein) or (ii) if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall
have issued a final nonappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
Merger;

 

(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before October 31, 2011, unless the failure of the Closing
to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of
such party set forth herein;

 

(d) by either Parent or the Company, provided that such party is not then in
material breach of any of its obligations under Section 7.4, if any approval
of the shareholders of either of the Company or Parent required for the
consummation of the Merger in accordance with this Agreement shall not have
been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain, after the use of all
reasonable efforts, the required vote at a duly held meeting of such
shareholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;

(e) by either Parent or the Company (provided that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach of any
of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part
of the other party, which breach is not cured within thirty days following
written notice to the party committing such breach, or which breach, by its
nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing (as hereinafter defined);
provided, however, that neither party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(e) unless the breach of representation
or warranty, together with all other such breaches, would entitle the party
receiving such representation not to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby under Section 8.2(a) (in the case of a breach of representation or
warranty by the Company) or Section 8.3(a) (in the case of a breach of
representation or warranty by Parent);

(f) by either Parent or the Company (provided that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach of any
of 

 



44  the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
other party, which breach shall not have been cured within thirty days
following receipt by the breaching party of written notice of such breach
from the other party hereto, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured
prior to the Closing; or

(g) by the Company at any time during the three-day period following the
Determination Date (as defined below), if both of the following conditions (1)
and (2) are satisfied:

 

(1) the Average Closing Price (as defined below) shall be less than the
product of 0.800 and the Starting Price; and

 

(2)(i) the number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the
Starting Price (such number being referred to herein as the "Parent Ratio")
shall be less than (ii) the number obtained by dividing the Index Price on the
Determination Date by the Index Price on the Starting Date (as defined below)
and subtracting 0.200 from such quotient (such number being referred to
herein as the "Index Ratio");

subject to the following. If the Company elects to exercise its termination
right pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, it shall give prompt
written notice to Parent; provided that such notice of election to terminate
may be withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned three-day period.
During the period commencing with its receipt of such notice and ending at
the Effective Time, Parent shall have the option of increasing the Exchange
Ratio in a manner such, and to the extent required, so that the condition set
forth in either clause (1) or (2) above shall be deemed not to exist.

For purposes hereof, the condition set forth in clause (1) above shall be
deemed not to exist if: 

the Exchange Ratio is increased so that the Per Share Consideration
(calculated by using the Average Closing Price, as provided in the definition
of "Per Share Consideration") after such increase is not less than 80% of the
Per Share Consideration calculated by using the Starting Price in lieu of the
Average Closing Price.

 

For purposes hereof, the condition set forth in clause (2) above shall be
deemed not to exist if:

 

the Exchange Ratio is increased so that the Adjusted Parent Ratio is not less
than the Index Ratio.

 

If Parent makes this election, within such period, it shall give prompt
written notice to Company of such election and the revised Exchange
Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section
9.1(g) and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms
(except as the Exchange Ratio, and derivatively the Per Share Stock
Consideration, shall have been so modified), and any references in this
Agreement to "Exchange Ratio" and "Per Share Stock Consideration" shall
thereafter be

 



45  deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio and Per Share Stock Consideration
after giving effect to any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 9.1(g).
For purposes of this Section 9.1(g), the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:

"Adjusted Parent Ratio" means the number obtained by dividing (x) the sum of
(A) the Average Closing Price plus (B) the quotient obtained by dividing the
aggregate increase in transaction value resulting from an increase in the
Exchange Ratio by the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding multiplied by the initial Exchange Ratio, on the Determination
Date, by (y) the Starting Price. For purposes of calculating the increase in
transaction value, the price per share of Parent Common Stock shall be
deemed to be the Average Closing Price.

"Average Closing Price" means the average of the last reported sale prices
per share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Stock Market (as
reported in The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported therein, in another
mutually agreed upon authoritative source) for the twenty consecutive trading
days immediately preceding the Determination Date.

"Determination Date" shall mean the fifth calendar day immediately prior to
the Effective Time, or if such calendar day is not a trading day on the
NASDAQ Stock Market, then the trading day immediately preceding such calendar
day.

"Index Price" on a given date means the closing price of the NASDAQ Bank
Index.

"Per Share Consideration" means the product of the Per Share Stock
Consideration times the Average Closing Price.

"Starting Date" means the trading day on the NASDAQ Stock Market preceding the
day on which the parties publicly announce the signing of this Agreement.

 

"Starting Price" means $9.88.

If Parent declares or effects a stock dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction between the Starting Date and the Determination Date, the prices
for the common stock of Parent shall be appropriately adjusted for the
purposes of applying this Section 9.1(g).

(h) by Parent, if (i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation to its
shareholders referred to in Section 7.4 hereof in order to accept a Superior
Proposal, or (ii) prior to acceptance for payment of the Company Common Stock
any person or group (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act)
(other than the Parent or its Subsidiaries) shall have become the beneficial
owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of at
least 20% of the outstanding Company Common Stock.

 



46 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect except (i) Sections 7.2(b), 7.3(e),
9.2 and 10.3 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii)
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
no party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising
out of its willful breach of any provision of this Agreement.

 

9.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval and
adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and other transactions contemplated
hereby, by the shareholders of either the Company or Parent; provided,
however, that after any approval and adoption of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by the Companys shareholders, there may not
be, without further approval and adoption of such shareholders, any amendment
of this Agreement which reduces the amount or changes the form of the
consideration to be delivered to the Company shareholders hereunder other than
as contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

9.4 _Extensions; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by its Board of Directors, may,
to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other party
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to
insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement
or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure.

10.5  _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or
Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect

 



48  in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the
words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The phrases
"the date of this Agreement," "the date hereof" and terms of similar import,
unless the context otherwise requires, shall be deemed to refer to January
26, 2011. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to require the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates to take
any action that would violate any applicable law, rule or regulation.

 

10.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart.

 

10.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the
instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the
Confidentiality Agreements between Parent and the Company.

 

10.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without regard
to any applicable conflicts of law.

10.9 _Enforcement of Agreement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that the provisions contained in 7.2(b) of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of Section
7.2(b) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
thereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity.

10.10 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

10.11 _Publicity_. Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement or
otherwise required by law or the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, so long as
this Agreement is in effect, neither Parent nor the Company shall, or shall
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any
public statement concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

 



49 10.12 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by
any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except
as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement (including the
documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon
any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

10.13 _Alternative Structure_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Parent may at any time modify the structure of the
Merger and/or the Bank Merger subject to the prior written consent of the
Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
provided that (i) the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of
Company Common Stock is not thereby changed in kind or reduced in amount as a
result of such modification, (ii) there are no adverse tax consequences to
the shareholders of the Company as a result of such modification, (iii) there
are no adverse tax consequences to Parent or the Company as a result of such
modification and (iv) such modification will not jeopardize or materially
delay receipt of any required approvals of Governmental Authorities or
otherwise impede or materially delay consummation of the Merger.

 



50 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent and the Company have caused this Agreement to be
executed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized as of the
date first above written.
