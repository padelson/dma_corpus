<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;If the Title Defect asserted is that the Net Revenue Interest attributable to any Property

Unit is greater than that stated in <U>Exhibit&nbsp;B</U>, then the Title Defect Value shall take into
account the relative change in the interest from <U>Exhibit&nbsp;B</U> and the appropriate Allocated
Value attributed to such Asset. If the Title Defect asserted is that the NRI attributable to any
Property is less than the NRI set forth on <U>Exhibit&nbsp;B</U>, then the Title Defect Value is the
product of the Allocated Value of the relevant Property, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the difference between such NRI set forth in <U>Exhibit&nbsp;B</U> and the actual NRI, and the
denominator of which is such NRI set forth in <U>Exhibit&nbsp;B</U>.

affected Asset (including any increase in WI for which there is not a proportionate increase in
NRI) for which the economic detriment to Purchaser is unliquidated, the amount of the Title Defect
Value shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the affected Asset, the
portion of the Asset affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the
potential discounted economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the affected Asset, and
the Title Defect Values placed upon the Title Defect by Purchaser and Sellers, and such other facts

entitled to an upward adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section&nbsp;12.2 with respect to all
Title Benefits, in an amount agreed upon by the Parties; <U>provided, however</U>, that if the
aggregate upward adjustment to the Purchase Price determined in accordance with Section&nbsp;5.5(d) does

adjustment to the Purchase Price determined in accordance with Section&nbsp;5.5(d) does exceed two
percent (2%) of the Purchase Price prior to any adjustments thereto, then the Purchase Price shall
only be adjusted upward by the amount of such excess. For purposes of this Agreement, the term

Arbitrator that are attributable to such third Person consultation. Within ten (10)&nbsp;days after the

Title Defect Value or a Title Benefit value, (a)&nbsp;Purchaser shall pay to Sellers the amount, if any,
so awarded by the Title Arbitrator to Sellers, and (b)&nbsp;Sellers shall pay to Purchaser the amount,

environmental reports prepared by, or on behalf of, Purchaser with respect to any Assessment or
Invasive Activity conducted on the Assets. In the event that any necessary disclosures under
applicable Environmental Laws are required with respect to matters discovered by any Assessment

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">American Arbitration Association (the &#147;<U>Environmental Arbitrator</U>&#148;). The arbitration
proceeding shall be held in Harris County, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do
not conflict with the terms of this Section. The Environmental Arbitrator&#146;s determination shall be
made within fifteen (15)&nbsp;Business Days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be
final and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination, the
Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in Section&nbsp;6.3 and may consider such
other matters as in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a
proper determination. Additionally, the Environmental Arbitrator may consult with and engage
disinterested third Persons to advise the arbitrator. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an
expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Environmental Defect Values
submitted by either Purchaser or Sellers and shall not be empowered to award damages, interest or
penalties to any Party with respect to any matter. Sellers and Purchaser shall each bear their own
legal fees and other costs of presenting their respective cases and indemnify and hold harmless the
other Party with respect thereto. Sellers (collectively)&nbsp;and Purchaser (individually)&nbsp;shall each
bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator, including any costs
incurred by the Environmental Arbitrator that are attributable to such third Person consultation.
Within ten (10)&nbsp;days after the Environmental Arbitrator delivers written notice to Sellers and
Purchaser of his award with respect to an Environmental Defect Value and the aggregate of all
Environmental Defect Values attributable to the affected Asset is less than the Allocated Value for
the affected Asset, then Sellers shall convey the affected Assets to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall
pay to Sellers the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced with respect to such affected
Assets at Closing, less the amount of any applicable Environmental Defect Values. If the
Environmental Arbitrator delivers written notice to Sellers and Purchaser that his award with
respect to an Environmental Defect exceeds the Allocated Value for such affected Asset, or the
aggregate of all Environmental Defect Values affecting such Asset exceed the Allocated Value for
such Asset, then the affected Asset shall be excluded from the contemplated transaction (and shall
constitute an Excluded Asset) and neither Party shall have any liability to the other with respect
to the Asset. With respect to any Asset affected by an Environmental Defect that was conveyed to
Purchaser at Closing, within ten (10)&nbsp;days after the Environmental Arbitrator delivers written
notice to Sellers and Purchaser of his award with respect to the applicable Environmental Defect
Value, Purchaser shall pay to Sellers the amount, if any so awarded by the Environmental Arbitrator
to Sellers, and Sellers shall pay to Purchaser the amount, if any, so awarded by the Environmental
Arbitrator to Purchaser.

time for exercising the Preferential Right has expired (without exercise or any action, or threat
of action, to enforce such Preferential Right) or the suit, action or other proceeding, if any,
referenced in clause (iv)(A) above is settled or a judgment is rendered (and no longer subject to
appeal) permitting transfer of the Retained Asset to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, and
Sellers obtain a waiver of or notice of election not to exercise or otherwise satisfy all remaining
Preferential Rights and Transfer Requirements with respect to such Retained Asset as contemplated
by this Section. At the delayed Closing, Purchaser shall pay Sellers a purchase price equal to the
amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced on account of the holding back of such Retained
Asset (as adjusted pursuant to Article&nbsp;3 through the new Closing Date therefor); <U>provided,
