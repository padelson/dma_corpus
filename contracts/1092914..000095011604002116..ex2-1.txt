SECTION 3.1. Amount and Form of Consideration   (a) The purchase price to be
paid by Buyer to the Sellers in consideration of the Shares shall be an
amount (the "Initial Purchase Price") in cash equal to:   (i) $104,000,000;
plus   13    (ii) the sum of (A) the amount of the Initial Net Working 
Capital and (B) the Excess Tax Benefit Amount; minus   (iii) the sum of (A)
the Bank Credit Facility Pay-off Amount,  (B) the Subordinated Notes Pay-off
Amount, (C) the Investment Banking  Fee Amount, (D) the Other Transaction
Costs Amount, and (E) the  Management Compensation Amount other than the
portion thereof payable  to Sellers pursuant to Section 6.4(a).   (b) The
final purchase price to be paid by Buyer to Sellers in consideration of the
Shares shall be the Initial Purchase Price, as adjusted by virtue of the
payment by Buyer or Seller of the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount in
accordance with Section 3.3 (the "Purchase Price").   (c) The Purchase Price
shall be allocated (i) first to the Preferred Shares, to the extent of the
full face amount and preferred return thereon and (ii) second, to the Common
Shares.   (d) Subject to Section 3.4, the Purchase Price shall be paid to
Sellers in such proportions as the Seller Representative shall specify in a
written notice, which shall be delivered to Buyer by the Seller
Representative at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date.  
SECTION 3.2. Payment of Consideration and Delivery of Shares at Closing. At
the Closing, Buyer shall pay the Initial Purchase Price (less the Escrow
Deposit) to the Sellers and the Sellers shall deliver to Buyer the Shares or
certificates representing the same, in each case in the appropriate form
for transfer to Buyer as specified in Article II. At the Closing, the Shares
shall be sold and delivered to Buyer free and clear of all Liens other than
Liens that may be imposed thereon by or on behalf of Buyer. At the Closing,
the Buyer shall also pay, on behalf of the Company, the Investment Banking
Fee Amount, the Other Transaction Cost Amount and the Management Compensation
Amount (other than the portion thereof payable to Sellers pursuant to Section
6.4(a)), which such amounts and the identities of the payees thereof shall be
specified in a written notice provided by Seller Representative to Buyer, to
the extent not provided in the CFO Certificate provided pursuant to Section
2.2(c). The Parties (i) acknowledge that Buyer\'s payment, on behalf of the
Company, of the Investment Banking Fee Amount, the Other Transaction Cost
Amount and the Management Compensation Amount pursuant to this Section 3.2
shall be treated for income tax purposes as a contribution by the Buyer to
the Company, followed by a payment of the Investment Banking Fee Amount, the
Other Transaction Cost Amount and the Management Compensation Amount by the
Company to the recipients thereof and (ii) shall report the payment of such
amounts in a manner that is consistent with such treatment.   SECTION 3.3.
Post-Closing Adjustment.   (a) In accordance with the terms and provisions
of this Section 3.3, Buyer shall pay to Seller Representative for the account
of the Sellers (in the same proportions in which the Initial Purchase Price
is to be paid to them in accordance with Section 3.1(d) or such other
proportions as they shall agree in writing), or Sellers (in the same
proportions) shall pay to Buyer (as the case may be), an amount (the "Net
Working Capital Adjustment Amount") equal to the amount by which the Final
Net Working Capital is greater (in which case Buyer shall pay the Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount to the Seller Representative for the account of the
Sellers) or is less (in which case Sellers shall pay the Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount to Buyer) than the Initial Net Working Capital.  
14    (b) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to
the Seller Representative (i) an unaudited balance sheet of the Company as of
the Closing Date (the "Final Balance Sheet") and (ii) a certificate executed
by an executive officer of each of Buyer and the Company setting forth their
proposed calculation of Final Net Working Capital, which shall be made in
accordance with and in a manner consistent with the illustration set forth in
Schedule I. The calculation of Final Net Working Capital set forth in such
certificate shall be binding upon the Buyer and Sellers, unless the Seller
Representative objects to such calculation in accordance with clause (c)
below.   (c) For a period of 60 days following the delivery of the Final
Balance Sheet and officers\' certificate referred to in clause (b) above,
Buyer and the Company shall give to the Seller Representative access during
normal business hours to the books and records of the Company reasonably
necessary for the Seller Representative to confirm the accuracy of the Final
Net Working Capital. If, within such 60-day period, the Seller Representative
notifies Buyer of any objections to the calculation by Buyer of the Final Net
Working Capital (the date upon which the Seller Representative notifies Buyer
of any such objections shall be referred to herein as the "Objection
Notification Date"), Buyer and the Seller Representative will attempt in good
faith to agree upon the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount prior to or on
the date that is 30 days after the Objection Notification Date.   (d) If
Buyer and the Seller Representative agree prior to or on the date that is 30
days after the Objection Notification Date to a Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount that is different from the amount that would be calculated
based upon the officers\' certificate delivered to the Seller Representative,
the payment described in clause (a) above shall be in the agreed upon
amount.   (e) If, on the other hand, Buyer and the Seller Representative do
not agree prior to or on the date that is 30 days after the Objection
Notification Date to a Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount, the matters in
dispute (but no other matters) shall be submitted to (i) a firm of
independent public accountants mutually agreed upon by Buyer and the Seller
Representative, or (ii) if Buyer and the Seller Representative do not agree
upon such independent public accountants within 30 days after the Objection
Notification Date, Deloitte and Touche LLP, or (iii) if the firm specified in
clause (i) or (ii) above is unwilling or unable to undertake the engagement
contemplated by this provision, a firm of independent public accountants
selected by the Seller Representative from among the "big four" accounting
firms (other than any firms that have been engaged to audit the financial
statements of, or perform any other significant services for, the Sellers or
any of their Affiliates at any time during the past five years) (in either
case, the "Final Arbiter"), which firm shall make a final and binding
determination as to all matters in dispute with respect to the calculation of
the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount as promptly as practicable but no
later than 45 days after its appointment. The Final Arbiter shall send its
written determination of Final Net Working Capital to Buyer and the Seller
Representative, together with a calculation of the Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount that results from that determination, at which point the
determination of the Final Arbiter, and the resulting calculation of the
Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount, shall be binding on Buyer and Sellers,
absent fraud or manifest error. The fees and expenses of the Final Arbiter
shall be borne equally by Buyer on the one hand and Sellers on the other
hand.   15    (f) The payment of the Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount as contemplated by clause (a) above will be made on the day that is
five days after the date upon which such amount has been finally determined
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.3. Such payment will be
made to Buyer or the Seller Representative for the account of the Sellers, as
the case may be, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account specified by Buyer or the Seller Representative, as applicable.  
SECTION 3.4. Escrow Arrangements. The Parties shall take all action required
to cause the Escrow Agent to hold all funds deposited with or held by the
Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, including the Escrow
Deposit and any interest or earnings accrued thereon (the "Escrow Funds"),
until such time as they are to be released to the parties in accordance with
this Section 3.4. The fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent shall be borne
equally by the Sellers on the one hand and Buyer on the other hand. The
Parties shall promptly execute and deliver such instructions and other
documents and take all other action as may be required to cause the Escrow
Agent to release the Escrow Funds to the Parties as follows:   (a) Except
as set forth in Section 3.4(d), within one Business Day after the earlier of
(i) the date upon which a binding settlement or compromise of the Subject
Litigation has been reached, which settlement or compromise provides for an
unconditional release of the Company or any successor in interest identified
by Buyer to Sellers (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise) from any
liability or obligation arising with respect to the Subject Litigation or
(ii) the date upon which a final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction has been entered to the effect that the Company or any
such successor in interest is not subject to liability in respect of the
Subject Litigation, the Escrow Agent shall release to the Sellers (to such
account or accounts as shall be designated by the Seller Representative) an
amount equal to $7,000,000, plus one half of all interest or earnings
included in the Escrow Funds (or, if less, the total amount of remaining
Escrow Funds not previously released in accordance with this Section 3.4)
(the "Litigation Escrow Amount");   (b) Within one Business Day after the
date upon which (A) Buyer, the Company or any such successor in interest to
the Company pays or becomes unconditionally obligated to pay (whether as a
result of any final judgment or arbitral award or as a result of any
settlement to which the Sellers have granted their consent in accordance with
Section 12.3) any Losses for which it is entitled to receive indemnification
from Sellers under Section 12.1 arising from a Third Party Claim, including
in respect of the Subject Litigation, or (B) Sellers become unconditionally
obligated to pay to Buyer (whether by agreement of the Parties or as a result
of an arbitral award entered in favor of Buyer) any Losses for which Buyer is
entitled to receive indemnification from Sellers under Section 12.1 arising
from a Claim other than a Third Party Claim, the Escrow Agent shall release
to the Buyer (to such account or accounts as shall be designated by the
Buyer) an amount equal to such Losses; and   16    (c) Except as set
forth in Section 3.4(d), immediately upon the second anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall release to the Sellers (to such account
or accounts as shall be designated by the Seller Representative) all
remaining Escrow Funds, other than the Litigation Escrow Amount (which may
only be released in accordance with the terms of Section 3.4(a) above).  
(d) Notwithstanding Sections 3.4(a) and (c) above, the parties shall not be
required to take action to cause the Escrow Agent to release Escrowed Funds
to the Sellers in accordance with such provisions if Buyer shall
have asserted good faith claims for indemnity under Section 12.1 which have
not been finally resolved (the "Pending Claims"), to the extent that, after
the release of such funds by the Escrow Agent as contemplated by Sections
3.4(a) or (c), the remaining Escrowed Funds held by the Escrow Agent would be
insufficient to pay the amount necessary to cover Sellers\' indemnification
obligations in respect of such Pending Claims.   (e) If, in order to secure
the release of any Escrowed Funds in accordance with this Section 3.4, it is
necessary for Buyer on the one hand or Sellers on the other hand to commence
arbitration proceedings in accordance with Section 14.9, the arbitrator may,
if it determines that the other party or parties (the "Nonconsenting Party")
failed or refused to take action to release all or part of the Escrowed Funds
to the other party (the "Other Party") as required by this Agreement and did
not have a good faith basis for such failure or refusal, order the
Nonconsenting Party to pay to the Other Party an amount equal to the interest
that would have accrued on the portion of the Escrowed Funds that would have
been released but for the failure or refusal on the part of the Nonconsenting
Party, at a rate at 10% per annum, for each day from and after the
commencement of such failure or refusal until the date upon which applicable
portion of the Escrowed Funds was actually released to the Other Party.

acceleration of any right or obligation of the Company or to the loss of any
benefit to which the Company is entitled under the provisions of any
agreement or instrument binding on the Company, except as would not,

person (i) as an independent contractor rather than as an employee, or (ii)
as an exempt or non-exempt employee.   SECTION 4.11. Employee Benefits.  
(a) Schedule 4.11 contains a true and complete list of each Employee Benefit
Plan, and each other option, incentive, deferred compensation or
fringe benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained or contributed to or
required to be contributed to by the Company for the benefit of any employee
or former employee of the Company (the "Company Plans").   (b) The Company
is not part of a controlled group of corporations and is not under common
control with any other entity, within the meaning of Section 414(b) or (c) of
the Code. The Company does not have any liability in connection with a
multiemployer plan, as defined in Sections 3(37) of ERISA, or any
plan subject to Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA.   (c) With
respect to the Company Plans, a true and complete copy of (i) each of the
Plans and related trust agreements, insurance contracts and other funding
agreements, (ii) the most recent Summary Plan Description for each Company
Plan for which a summary plan description is required and any summary

(iii) the most recent Annual Report (Form 5500) filed with the IRS have been
furnished to Buyer. All contributions required with respect to each Company
Plan for all periods through the Closing Date shall have been made by such
date (or provided for by the Company by adequate reserves on its financial
statements).   (d) Each Company Plan has been administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and in compliance with the provisions
of ERISA, the Code (including rules and regulations thereunder) and other
Laws applicable thereto. The Company and each Company ERISA Affiliate have
performed all material obligations required to be performed by them under,
are not in any material respect in default under or in violation of, and have
no knowledge of any default or violation by any party to, any Company Plan.
With respect to the Company Plans, no event has occurred and, to the
knowledge of the Company, there exists no condition or set of circumstances,
in connection with which the Company is reasonably likely to be subject to
any material liability under the terms of such Company Plans, ERISA, the
Code, or any other applicable Law. The Company does not have any actual or
contingent liability under Title IV of ERISA, including, without limitation,
any liability in connection with the termination or reorganization of any
employee benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA and no fact or event
exists which is reasonably likely to give rise to such liability.  
22    (e) The Company has made available to Buyer: (i) copies of all
material severance agreements, programs and policies of the Company; and (ii)
copies of all material plans, programs, agreements and other arrangements of
the Company with or relating to its employees which contain change in control
provisions. Except as described in Schedule 4.11, neither the execution nor
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (A) result in any payment becoming due to any
director, officer or employee of the Company under any Company Plan or
otherwise, which payment is material in relation to the compensation
previously provided to such individual, (B) materially increase any benefits
otherwise payable under any Company Plan, which increase is material in
relation to the benefits previously provided, or (C) result in any
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any material benefits.  
(f) The Company sponsors, maintains and contributes to only one Employee
Benefit Plan that is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code and Section 401(k) of the Code (the "401(k) Plan"). The
401(k) Plan document, together with any amendments thereto, contains
the material provisions required to be contained in such a plan, or any
such provisions that are missing from the 401(k) Plan would be able to be
added to the 401(k) Plan with Internal Revenue Service approval without
material cost to the Company. To the Sellers\' Knowledge, there exists no
condition or set of circumstances which is likely to adversely affect the
qualified status of the 401(k) Plan or that would prevent the IRS from
issuing a favorable determination letter with respect to the qualified status
of the 401(k) Plan.   SECTION 4.12. Taxes.   (a) Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.12:   (i) (A) all federal and all material state and local Tax

by that jurisdiction;   (iii) there is not in force any extension of time
with respect  to the due date for the filing of any Tax Return of or with
respect to  the Company or any waiver or agreement for any extension of time
for  the assessment or payment of any Tax of or with respect to the
Company;   (iv) the Company does not own any interest in any controlled 
foreign corporation (as defined in section 957 of the Code), foreign 
personal holding company (as defined in Section 552 of the Code),  passive
foreign investment company (as defined in section 1297 of the  Code);   (v)
none of the Property of the Company is subject to a  safe-harbor lease
(pursuant to section 168(f)(8) of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1954 as in

Act of 1986) or is "tax-exempt use  property" (within the meaning of section
168(h) of the Code) or  "tax-exempt bond financed property" (within the
meaning of section  168(g)(5) of the Code);   (vi) the Company will not be

installment sale or  open transaction disposition made prior to the Closing
Date, or as a  result of prepaid amounts received on or prior to the Closing
Date;   (vii) the Company has not entered into any written agreement  with
any taxing authority that requires the Company to take any action  or to
refrain from taking any action that could have a Material Adverse  Effect on
the Tax liabilities of the Company after the Closing Date;   (viii) No
Seller or director or officer (or employee  responsible for Tax matters) of
the Company expects any authority to  assess any material additional Taxes
for any period for which Tax  Returns have been filed. No foreign, federal,
state, or local tax  audits or administrative or judicial Tax proceedings are
pending or  being conducted with respect to the Company. The Company has
not  received from any foreign, federal, state, or local taxing authority 
(including jurisdictions where the Company has not filed Tax Returns)  any
(i) notice indicating an intent to open an audit or other review,  (ii)
request for information related to Tax matters, or (iii) notice of 
deficiency or proposed adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed,  asserted,
or assessed by any taxing authority against the Company.  Schedule 4.12 lists
all federal, state, local, and foreign income Tax  Returns filed with respect
the Company for taxable periods ended on or  after July 13, 2000, indicates
those Tax Returns that have been  audited, and indicates those Tax Returns

Company filed or  received since July 13, 2000;   24    (ix) The Company
is not a party to any agreement, contract,  arrangement or plan that has

not a party to or bound by  any Tax allocation or sharing agreement. The
Company (A) has not been a  member of an affiliated group filing a
consolidated federal income Tax  Return and (B) has no Liability for the
Taxes of any Person under Reg.  ss.1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of

of not less than $36.020 million and the Company  had net operating loss
carryovers of not less than $14.257 million;   (xi) The due and unpaid Taxes
of the Company (A) did not, as  of the date of the Audited Balance Sheet or
the Latest Balance Sheet,  exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than
any reserve for  deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book  and Tax income) set forth on the face of the Audited Balance
Sheet or  the Latest Balance Sheet, respectively (rather than in any notes 
thereto), and (B) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the  passage of
time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past  custom and
practice of the Company in filing its Tax Returns. Since the  date of the
Latest Balance Sheet, the Company has not incurred any  liability for Taxes
arising from extraordinary gains or losses, as that  term is used in GAAP,
outside the ordinary course of business  consistent with past custom and
practice; and   (xii) The Company has not distributed stock of another
person,  nor has had its stock distributed by another Person, in a
transaction  that was purported or intended to be governed in whole or in
part by  Code ss.355 or ss.361.   (b) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Article IV, the Sellers and the Company make no
representation or warranty to Buyer relating to Taxes or the absence of
liabilities with respect thereto other than pursuant to Section 4.6 and this

terms of this Agreement will vest Buyer on the Closing Date with good and
valid title to all of the Shares, free and clear of all Liens and other

outstanding shares of Capital Stock of the Company on a fully-diluted basis
(after giving effect to the transactions described in Section 6.4(a)).  
25    SECTION 4.14. Dividends and Certain Other Payments. Except as set
forth on Schedule 4.14, since the date of the Latest Balance Sheet, the
Company has not paid or declared any dividends or made or agreed to make any
distributions in respect of its Capital Stock or purchased, redeemed or
otherwise acquired any Capital Stock or other securities of the Company.
Except for regularly scheduled interest payments on the Subordinated Notes,
the Company has not made any payments of any portion of the principal amount

Company or for which the Company has filed applications.   (b) Since July
13, 2000 and, to the Sellers\' Knowledge, prior to such date, the Company has

compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws and in
substantial compliance with the requirements and conditions of the Permits

(ii) is pending or, to the Sellers\' Knowledge, threatened against the
Company, by any Governmental Authority or other Person, in each case under or
in connection with any Environmental Law in connection with the operation of
its facilities or the conduct of its business, that could give rise to a
material Loss or material Claim under an Environmental Law.   26    (d)
To the Sellers\' Knowledge, there are no releases or threatened releases of
Hazardous Materials on any property owned, leased or otherwise used by the
Company that, if such releases or threatened releases of Hazardous Materials
were brought to the attention of any Governmental Authority or other Person,
would likely give rise to a material Loss or material Claim under
an Environmental Law.   (e) The Company has provided or made available to
Buyer true and correct copies of all internal and external environmental
reports or assessments with respect to the environmental condition of any
Property or Facilities owned or leased by the Company or the compliance by
the Company with Environmental Laws prepared by or on behalf of the Company
or within the possession and control of the Company relating to all Property,
Pipeline Assets or Facilities owned or leased by the Company, including, but
not limited to, the Koch oil pipeline system acquired by the Company in
connection with the Texaco Agreement or the Waynoka Plant.   (f) Neither
the Sellers nor the Company are parties to any indemnification or other
contractual agreements that are likely to give rise to liability or
responsibility under any Environmental Laws, except where those contractual
obligations are not likely to have a Material Adverse Effect upon the
Company.   (g) Neither the Sellers nor the Company are aware of any proposed
or pending changes to applicable Environmental Laws (other than changes that
have been publicly proposed to be applicable to the national or regional
natural gas gathering, treatment or processing industry generally) that are
likely to become effective in the next 18 months and that could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect upon the Company.   (h) To the
Sellers\' Knowledge, there are no presently existing facts, circumstances,
conditions or occurrences involving the Facilities, properties or operations
of the Company that could reasonably be expected to form the basis of a Claim
under an Environmental Law against the Company that could reasonably
be expected to result in a material Loss under an Environmental Law or that
could reasonably be expected to materially increase the operating or
compliance costs for the Facilities over the next 18 months.   (i) Since
July 13, 2000 and, to the Sellers\' Knowledge, prior to such date, all
hazardous substances, solid waste, and oil and gas exploration and production
wastes, if any, generated at any and all Property of the Company have been
transported, treated and disposed of in all material respects in
accordance with Environmental Laws and so as not to pose an imminent and
substantial endangerment to public health or welfare or the environment, and,
to the Sellers\' Knowledge, all such transport carriers and treatment and
disposal facilities have been and are operating in compliance in all material
respects with Environmental Laws and so as not to pose an imminent and
substantial endangerment to public health or welfare or the environment, and
are not the subject of any existing, pending or threatened action,
investigation or inquiry by any Governmental Authority as to any of the
matters covered by this paragraph (i).   27    SECTION 4.17. Material

any business (whether by merger, sale of stock, sale of assets or otherwise),
(iii) any agreement with the Sellers or any of their Affiliates or any
director or officer of the Energy Spectrum Sellers or any of their Affiliates
that will continue in effect after the Closing (provided that for purpose of
this Section 4.17 the proviso to the first sentence of the definition of
Affiliate will not apply), (iv) any contract with a labor union, (v)
any agreement that limits in any material respect the ability of the Company
to compete in any line of business or with any Person, (vi) any Contract with

listed in Schedule 4.17 and each amendment thereto executed by the Company.
The Company is not in breach or default in the performance of its duties or
obligations under any Contract listed in Schedule 4.17, where such breach or
default, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Contract listed in Schedule 4.17 is in
full force and effect and constitutes the enforceable obligations of the
Company and, to the Sellers\' Knowledge, the other parties thereto and,
except as set forth on Schedule 4.17, will continue in effect without
requirement for any consent by any party as a result of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   SECTION 4.18.
Title to Property; Leases. The Company has good, sufficient and clear title
to all of its Property, in each case free and clear of Liens, adverse
possession or abandonment claims, other than those defects in title or, with
respect to the Pipeline Assets or Facilities, failures in title which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.18 hereto, (i)
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
result in any material violation of, or result in any material default under,
any contract or agreement between the Company and any third parties with
respect to the ownership or operation of the Property and (ii) the Company is
not in material violation of or material default under any such contract or
agreement and there is no notice of material default or formally announced
potential material default or event of default with respect to any such
contract or agreement. Schedule 4.18 hereto lists all material leases to
which the Company is a party or is bound, whether as lessee or lessor, with
respect to any real property and all material surface easements and railroad
crossing rights of the Company. All leases, surface easements and railroad
crossing agreements held by the Company are valid and subsisting and are in
full force and effect, with such exceptions as could not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to
conduct its operations in a manner consistent with past practice. Except as
set forth on Schedule 4.18 hereto, there is no default, notice of default or
formally announced potential default or event of default with respect to any
lease, surface easement or railroad crossing rights of the Company that could
reasonably be expected to interfere in any material respect with the conduct
of the business of the Company. All material leases, surface easements and
railroad crossing rights of the Company will continue in effect without
requirement for any consent by any party as a result of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   28    SECTION
4.19. Intellectual Property. To the Sellers\' Knowledge, the Company owns or
has a valid right to use all Intellectual Property that is individually or in
the aggregate material to the conduct of the business of the Company. The
Company has not received any written notice asserting that, and, to the
Sellers\' Knowledge, there is no reason to believe that, the conduct of
the business of the Company infringes upon or violates any Intellectual
Property of any Person, except for any infringement or violation that could
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.20. Intercompany Liabilities. Except
as set forth on Schedule 4.20 there are no intercompany liabilities (other
than the liabilities evidenced by the Subordinated Notes) as of the date of
the Latest Balance Sheet between the Energy Spectrum Sellers and their
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand. Since the
date of the Latest Balance Sheet, other than accrued interest on the
Subordinated Notes there has not been any accrual of liability by the Company
to the Energy Spectrum Sellers or any of their Affiliates or any transaction
between the Company and the Energy Spectrum Sellers and any of their
Affiliates.   SECTION 4.21. Insurance Coverage. Schedule 4.21 sets forth a
list of all insurance policies and fidelity bonds currently in effect (or, in
the case of occurrence-based policies, in effect since May 18, 2000)
providing insurance coverage to the Company with respect to the assets,
business, operations, employees, officers or directors of the Company. There
is no claim by the Company pending under any such policies or bonds to which
coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters or
issuers of such policies or bonds nor has any denial of coverage or
reservation of rights notice been given or, to Sellers\' Knowledge, proposed
to be given, by any such underwriter and issuer with respect to a claim that
is still pending. All premiums due under such policies and bonds have been
timely paid and the Company has otherwise complied in all material respects
with the terms and conditions of all such policies and bonds. Such policies
of insurance and bonds are in full force and effect. To Sellers\' Knowledge,
there is no threatened termination of, or material alteration of coverage
under, any such policies and bonds. No such policies and bonds will become
terminable, in whole or in part, as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.   SECTION 4.22. Permits. Schedules 4.16(a) and 4.22 list
all Permits held by the Company affecting, or relating to, the assets or
business of the Company. Except as set forth in Schedules 4.16(a) and 4.22,
(i) the Permits are valid and in full force and effect, (ii) the Company has
not received any notice that any Governmental Authority intends to cancel,
terminate or not renew any such Permit, (iii) the Company is not in default
under and, to the Sellers\' Knowledge, no condition exists that with or
without the giving of notice or the passage of time, or both, would
constitute a default under, any such Permit and (iv) no Permit will be
terminated or become terminable, in whole or in part, as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Permits listed under the
caption "FCC Permits" in such Schedule (the "FCC Permits") are not material
to the business, operations or financial condition of the Company, and the
failure to obtain any required transfer of such Permits in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement would not interfere in
any material respect with the business, operations or financial condition of
the Company after the Closing.   29    SECTION 4.23. Hedging. Except as
set forth on Schedule 4.23, (a) the Company is not engaged in any natural gas
or other futures or options trading in respect of which it has any material
future liability, or a party to any swaps, hedges futures or similar
instruments, and (b) the Company is in full compliance with all applicable
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 ("FASB
133") and as of December 31, 2003 was in a mark-to-market position with
regard to all hedging or futures commodities transactions as of such date.

appropriate taxing authority and Buyer shall cause the Company to pay all
Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns.   46    (c) Cooperation on

cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other  Party\'s
request) the provision of records and information which are  reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding  and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to  provide additional

further agree, upon request, to use  their best efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any  Governmental Authority or any other

governmental consent or authorization required to effect the transfer thereof
has not been obtained, the earlier of (A) 45 days after the date upon which
such conditions have been satisfied, (B) the date on which the FCC Permits
have been obtained or (C) the date on which the FCC Permits are terminated in
accordance with Section 6.9), which date may be extended in writing by the
mutual agreement of the Energy Spectrum Sellers and Buyer; provided that, no
Party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (b) if the failure

obligation of such Party contained in this Agreement; and   (c)

preparation of this Agreement and to its performance of and compliance with
all agreements and conditions contained herein on its part to be performed or

failure of a Party to fulfill a condition to the performance of
the obligations of another Party, (ii) the willful failure to perform a
covenant of this Agreement, or (iii) the intentional breach by a Party hereto
or any representation or warranty or agreement contained in this Agreement,

by another Party as a result of such failure or breach.   48    ARTICLE

Procedures.   (a) Promptly after receipt by a Person entitled to
indemnification under Sections 12.1 or 12.2 of a notice of any Claim asserted
or brought by a third party (a "Third Party Claim"), such Person (the
"Indemnified Party") will, if the Indemnified Party believes that it is or
may be entitled to indemnification in respect of such Claim by another Party
to this Agreement (the "Indemnifying Party"), give notice of such Claim to
each Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability
that the Indemnifying Party may have hereunder with respect to such Claim
except to the extent that such failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party
results in the forfeiture by the Indemnifying Party of substantial rights or
defenses otherwise available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such
Claim.   (b) If any Third Party Claim is asserted or brought against
an Indemnified Party and such Indemnified Party gives notice to the
Indemnifying Party of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be
entitled to participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim and, to the
extent that it so elects (unless the Indemnifying Party is also a party to
the Proceeding in which the Third Party Claim is asserted and the Indemnified
Party determines in good faith that (i) joint representation would present a
conflict of interest under applicable standards of professional conduct, (ii)
the conduct of the defense by the Indemnifying Party would result in material
prejudice to the Indemnified Party due to actual or potential differing
interests between the Parties in the Proceeding or (iii) the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates could be adversely affected in any material
respect in such Proceeding other than as a result of monetary damages, in
which case the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnified Party
of such determination) to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and, after such
notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election
to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will
not, as long as it continues to conduct such defense in good faith, be liable
to the Indemnified Party under this Article XII for any fees of other counsel
or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Third Party Claim,
in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection
with the defense of such Third Party Claim, other than reasonable costs of
investigation; and, in any event, the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim. Unless and until a
Third Party Claim has been assumed by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third    51   Party Claim,
no compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim may be effected by the
Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, unless (i) such compromise or settlement includes a complete and
unconditional release of liability on the part of the Indemnified Party, (ii)
there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of
the rights of any Person on the part of the Indemnified Party, and (iii)
the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by
the Indemnifying Party and any other Persons (other than the Indemnified
Party). Subject to the last sentence of this Section 12.3(b), if the
Indemnified Party conducts the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall be bound by any judgment entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction with respect to such Third Party Claim, except to the
extent that such judgment has not yet become final or has been appealed or
stayed (it being understood that any decision on the part of the Indemnified
Party as to whether such judgment should be appealed shall be made in good
faith and after consultation with the Indemnifying Party). Whether a Third
Party Claim is assumed by the Indemnifying Party or conducted by the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate in providing information to and consulting with each other about
the Third Party Claim. In no event shall the Indemnified Party consent to the
entry of judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to
a Third Party Claim for which it is seeking or will seek indemnification
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party.   (c)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (and without regard
to any of the qualifications contained in paragraph (b) above), Sellers shall
conduct the defense of and control the Subject Litigation and any Related
Litigation, with counsel of their choice and shall be entitled to settle or
compromise the Subject Litigation and any Related Litigation, without
the prior written consent of Buyer. In addition, Sellers shall be entitled
to receive and retain any amounts awarded to the Company or the Sellers
in connection with the Subject Litigation or any Related Litigation, whether
in respect of fees and disbursements of counsel, based upon counterclaims
asserted by the Company or the Sellers or otherwise.   (d) A Claim for
indemnification for any matter that does not constitute a Third Party Claim
may be asserted by written notice from an Indemnified Party to the
Indemnifying Party from whom indemnification is sought, which notice shall
set forth with reasonable specificity the nature, basis and dollar
amount (where ascertainable) of such Claim.   (e) Buyer shall promptly
notify Seller Representative in writing upon receipt by Buyer, any of its
Affiliates or the Company of notice of any pending or threatened Tax audits,
administrative proceeding, assessments, or other Tax proceedings that may
result in Tax Losses for which any Seller would be required to indemnify
Buyer pursuant to Section 12.1(g) (a "Tax Contest"). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein (and without regard to any of the
qualifications contained in paragraph (b) above), Seller Representative shall
have the sole right to conduct, control, and settle any such Tax Contest. and
to employ counsel of its choice at its expense, subject to the following
conditions:   52    (i) Seller Representative shall promptly provide a
copy of any  written communications received by Seller Representative from
any  taxing authority with respect to such Tax Contest to Buyer upon
receipt  by Seller Representative and shall keep Buyer reasonably informed
of  all material developments in any such Tax Contest.   (ii) Buyer shall
be entitled to participate, at its own  expense and with counsel of its
choice, in (but not control) such Tax  Contest.   (iii) Seller shall not be
entitled to settle, either  administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any Tax  Contest that would materially adversely affect the
liability for Taxes  of Buyer or the Company for any period after the Closing
Date without  the prior written consent of Buyer. Such consent shall not be 
unreasonably withheld and shall not be necessary to the extent that  Seller
has indemnified Buyer against the effects of any such  settlements.  
SECTION 12.4. Limits on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement:   (a) The Sellers shall not have any
obligation to provide indemnification for Losses pursuant to Section 12.1(a)
or (b) arising out of or related to breaches of representations and
warranties referred to therein, except to the extent that the aggregate
amount of all such Losses pursuant to such Section exceeds $600,000 (the
"Basket Amount"), in which case the Sellers shall be liable to the Buyer
Indemnified Parties only for such Losses in excess of the Basket Amount;
provided, however, that any materiality or Material Adverse Effect
qualification with respect to any such representation or warranty shall be
disregarded solely for purposes of calculating the magnitude of
Losses resulting from the breach of such representation or warranty to
determine whether the Basket Amount has been met. The maximum obligation of
the Sellers to provide indemnification for all Losses pursuant to Section
12.1(a), (b), (c) and (d) arising out of or related to breaches of
representations and warranties and in respect of covenants and agreements to
be performed by the Sellers or the Company referred to therein prior to the
Closing Date shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to $36,000,000.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that the
limitations contained in this Section 12.4(a) shall not apply to (i) the
obligation of the Sellers to provide indemnification pursuant to Section
12.1(e), (f) and (g) or (ii) a breach of the representations and warranties
of the Sellers or the Company contained in Sections 4.5 and 4.12.   (b)
Buyer shall not have any obligation to provide indemnification for Losses
pursuant to Section 12.2(a) arising out of or related to breaches
of representations and warranties referred to therein, except to the extent
that the aggregate amount of all such Losses pursuant to such Section exceeds
the Basket Amount, in which case Buyer shall be liable to the Sellers only
for such Losses in excess of the Basket Amount, provided, however, that any
materiality or material adverse effect qualification in any such
representation or warranty shall be disregarded solely for purposes of
calculating the magnitude of Losses resulting from the breach of such
representation or warranty to determine whether the Basket Amount has been
met. The maximum obligation of Buyer to provide indemnification for Losses
pursuant to Section 12.2(a) and (b) arising out of or related to breaches of
representations and warranties and in respect of covenants and agreements to
be performed by Buyer prior to the Closing Date shall be limited to an
aggregate amount equal to $36,000,000. It is expressly understood and agreed
that the limitations contained in this Section 12.4(b) shall not apply to the
obligation of Buyer to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 12.2(c) or
(d).   53    (c) The representations and warranties of the Sellers and
the Company on the one hand and Buyer on the other contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto, and rights to
indemnification in respect thereof, shall survive the Closing and continue in
effect until the second anniversary of the Closing Date; provided that (i)
the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.2, 4.5, 4.13 and
5.2 shall survive indefinitely and without limitation, (ii) the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.12 shall survive until
the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the matters
covered thereby and (iii) all Environmental Representations shall survive
until the earlier of the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date or the
expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the matters covered
thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a Change of Control
of the Company occurs at any time after the Closing, all Environmental
Representations, and rights to indemnification in respect thereof, shall
terminate and cease to be of any further force or effect on the later of (i)
the date of such Change of Control and (ii) the third anniversary of the
Closing Date.   (d) Other than in respect of Claims based upon actual fraud,
the indemnification provisions of this Article XII shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy with regard to money damages (but not equitable relief) for
any breaches of representations and warranties that survive the Closing and
in respect of any inaccuracy or omission in any certificate, documents or
other information furnished to Buyer in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and for any breaches of covenants and
agreements under this Agreement occurring prior to the Closing.   SECTION
12.5. Mitigation; Insurance.   (a) The Parties shall cooperate with each
other in connection with resolving any Claims as to which indemnification is
provided by any Party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In the
case of any Claim for which it is reasonably likely that a Party may have a
direct or indirect right of recovery against one or more third parties
(including, but not limited to, rights of recovery under insurance policies
or indemnification arrangements with third parties), such Party shall seek
recovery of such Claim from such third parties for so long as pursuit of such
recovery is commercially reasonable, provided that the foregoing shall not
prohibit or restrict an Indemnified Party from initiating or pursuing any
Claims under this Article XII. To the extent that a Party obtains an actual
dollar recovery in respect of any such Claim from any third parties, (i) such
Party shall use the funds provided by such recovery (in lieu of funds
provided by any other Party pursuant to the indemnification provisions of
this Article XII) to pay or otherwise satisfy such Claims, (ii) the recovery
shall reduce the amount of Losses for purposes of determining the amount of
the Sellers\' indemnity obligations under this Article XII in respect of such
Claim and (iii) if received after any indemnity payment by the Sellers under
this Article XII, the amount actually recovered (but not in excess of
the amount of the indemnity payment previously paid by the Sellers) shall be
paid to the Sellers.   54    (b) If after the Closing Date the Company
becomes subject to any obligation to remedy or otherwise address any
condition, occurrence or other matter that is the subject of an Environmental
Representation, the Company shall proceed to remedy such condition,
occurrence or other matter in an appropriate, cost-effective and reasonable
manner and (unless claims in respect of such condition, occurrence or other
matter are excluded from the scope of coverage provided under the
Environmental Insurance Policies) in compliance with any notice requirements,
cooperation conditions and other guidelines, policies or provisions
applicable to claims made by the Company under the terms of the insurance
policies identified in Schedule 12.5(b) hereto (such policies and
any substitute policies referred to herein, the "Environmental Insurance
Policies"). The costs actually incurred in remedying or otherwise addressing
any such condition, occurrence or other matter shall be paid by the Company,
and the Company shall comply with all provisions of the Environmental
Insurance Policies applicable to the recovery of any such costs and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery thereof from the insurers
that issued the Environmental Insurance Policies or its successors (the
"Insurers"), which efforts shall include, without limitation, taking all
commercially reasonable actions necessary to maintain the Environmental
Insurance Policies (including one or more substitute policies providing for
substantially the same coverage) in full force and effect (it being
understood and agreed that the Company and Buyer will not effect an
assignment of any such policies after the Closing that would result in a
termination of coverage under such policies) and, if requested by Sellers,
filing an action, suit or proceeding against the Insurers and
taking reasonable steps to prosecute the same (provided, that Sellers shall
agree to pay the costs and expenses incurred in connection with such action,
suit or proceeding, and shall be entitled to receive and retain any portion
of such costs and expenses that are repaid in connection with such action,
suit or proceeding). The Company shall keep the Sellers informed regarding
any significant communications with the Insurers, and shall promptly deliver
to Sellers copies of any written communications delivered to or received from
the Insurers in connection with claims made under the Environmental
Insurance Policies.   ARTICLE XIII  SELLER REPRESENTATIVE   SECTION
13.1. Seller Representative. Each Seller, by executing this Agreement, does
hereby, for itself or himself and its or his heirs, representatives and
successors, irrevocably constitute and appoint Energy Spectrum Capital II LP
as its or his agent and representative (in such capacity, the "Seller
Representative") to take any and all actions required or permitted to be
taken by the Seller Representative under or in connection with
this Agreement, and for the following additional purposes:   (a) To execute
and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby as the Seller Representative, in
its sole discretion, determines to be necessary or desirable;   55    (b)
To take any action on the part of the Sellers contemplated by the Escrow
Agreement and authorize the release of the Escrow Funds pursuant thereto;  
(c) To collect and receive all moneys and other proceeds and property payable
to the Sellers pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and, subject to the
withholding of amounts necessary to pay expenses in accordance with
Section 13.3, to cause the same to be disbursed to the Sellers;   (d) To
enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Sellers or any of them
arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement or any
other agreement, document, instrument or certificate relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby and, in connection therewith, to
assert, institute, investigate, defend, contest, litigate, prosecute and
appeal any claim with respect thereto; to compromise or settle any such claim
on such terms as the Seller Representative shall determine to be appropriate;
and give receipts, releases and discharges on behalf of all of the Sellers
with respect to any such claim;   (e) To refrain from enforcing any rights
and interests of the Sellers arising out of or under or in any manner
relating to this Agreement and each other agreement, document, instrument or
certificate relating to the transactions contemplated hereby (provided,
however, that no such failure to act on the part of the Seller Representative
shall, except as otherwise expressly provided in any of the foregoing
agreements, instruments or documents, be deemed a waiver of any such right or
interest by the Seller Representative or the Sellers); and   (f) To make,
execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements, guarantees,
orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to
do any and all things and to take any and all action that the
Seller Representative, in its sole discretion, may consider necessary, proper
or convenient in connection with or to carry out the activities described
in paragraphs (a) through (d) above.  The grant of authority provided for
in this Section 13.1 (i) is coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable
and (to the maximum extent permitted by law) shall survive the death,
incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of any Seller and shall be binding on
its or his heirs, representatives and successors; and (ii) may be exercised
by the Seller Representative by signing separately as Seller Representative
for each of the Sellers or, after listing all of the Sellers executing an
instrument, by the signing as Seller Representative for all of them.  
SECTION 13.2. Engagement of Agents. In connection with the performance of its
responsibilities as Seller Representative under this Agreement, the Seller
Representative shall have the right at any time and from time to time
to select and engage, at the cost and expense of the Sellers, such
attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, advisors, consultants and
clerical personnel and obtain such other professional and expert assistance,
as the Seller Representative determines is necessary or desirable.  
56    SECTION 13.3. Payment of Expenses. The Seller Representative
may withhold and retain from any payments to be made to the Sellers such
amount or amounts as it shall determine are necessary to pay all known (or
reasonably anticipated) expenses that are required to be paid or borne by the
Sellers pursuant to this Agreement, or are otherwise incurred by the
Seller Representative in the performance of its duties under this Agreement
(including, but not limited to, its own out-of-pocket expenses) and shall pay
all such expenses out of the amount or amounts so withheld. If the amounts so
withheld are insufficient to pay all such expenses, the Seller Representative
may request that each Seller deliver to the Seller Representative payment of
his or her ratable share of the amount of such deficiency in accordance with
the portion of the Purchase Price payable to each such Seller.   SECTION
13.4. Compensation. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by each of the
Sellers, the Seller Representative shall not be entitled to any
fee, commission or other compensation for the performance of its services
hereunder, but shall be entitled, in accordance with Section 13.3, to the
payment of all its expenses incurred as Seller Representative.   SECTION
13.5. Exculpation. In performing its responsibilities under this Agreement or
any instruments, agreements or documents relating hereto, and in exercising
or failing to exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon the Seller
Representative hereunder, (i) the Seller Representative assumes and
shall incur no responsibility whatsoever to any Seller by reason of any error
in judgment or other act or omission performed or omitted hereunder,
excepting only responsibility for any act or failure to act that represents
gross negligence or willful misconduct, and (ii) the Seller Representative
shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or
other independent experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any error
in judgment or other act or omission of the Seller Representative pursuant to
such advice shall in no event subject the Seller Representative to liability
to any Seller.   SECTION 13.6. Successors; Removal   (a) The Seller
Representative shall have the power to appoint one or more successor Seller
Representatives in accordance with this Section 13.6. A successor Seller
Representative need not be a Seller. Any successor Seller Representative
shall have all of the authority and responsibilities conferred upon or
delegated to the Seller Representative pursuant to this Article XIII.   (b)
The Seller Representative may be removed at any time pursuant to a written
instrument executed by each of the Sellers.   (c) If the Seller
Representative has been removed or is unable or unavailable to perform the
duties hereunder, or the Seller Representative shall have resigned without
appointing a successor Seller Representative, a successor Seller
Representative shall be appointed by the Sellers. In the event that
the Sellers fail to agree upon a successor Seller Representative with 30 days
of the removal, resignation or other termination of the Seller
Representative, the successor Seller Representative shall be appointed by
Energy Spectrum Capital III LP.   57    SECTION 13.7. Survival. All of
the immunities and powers granted to the Seller Representative under this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and continue thereafter in full force and
effect.   ARTICLE XIV  GENERAL   SECTION 14.1. Amendments. This Agreement
may only be amended by an instrument in writing executed by each of Buyer and
the Sellers.   SECTION 14.2. Waivers. The observance of any term of this
Agreement may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and
either retroactively or prospectively) by the Party entitled to enforce such
term, but such waiver shall be effective only if it is in a writing signed by
the Party entitled to enforce such term and against which such waiver is to
be asserted. Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no delay
or omission on the part of any Party in exercising any right or privilege
under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver
on the part of any Party of any right or privilege under this Agreement
operate as a waiver of any other right or privilege under this Agreement nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right or privilege preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or
privilege under this Agreement.   SECTION 14.3. Notices. Any notices,
waivers, consents, approvals or other communications required or permitted
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be sufficiently given (and shall be
deemed to have been duly given upon receipt) if sent by overnight mail,
registered mail or certified mail, postage prepaid, or by hand, to the
Parties at the following addresses (or at such other address for a Party as
shall be specified by like notice).   (a) If to the Sellers or the Company,

Attn: James M. Lurie Esq. and Howard L. Margulis,  Esq.   SECTION 14.4.
Successors and Assigns; Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their
respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns. Neither
this Agreement nor any rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned
without the written consent of the other Parties; provided, that Buyer may
assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder to one or more
Affiliates of Buyer without the written consent of the Sellers (it being
understood that Buyer may assign its rights to acquire a portion of the
Securities to one Affiliate of Buyer and the remainder of the Securities to
another Affiliate of Buyer), but in the event of any such assignment Buyer
shall remain directly liable and responsible for the payment and performance
for all obligations under this Agreement (as fully and to the same extent as
if such assignment had not occurred). Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person, other than the
Parties hereto and their respective successors, legal representatives
and permitted assigns, any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, and no Person shall be
deemed a third Party beneficiary under or by reason of this Agreement.  
SECTION 14.5. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or
the application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance, shall
be declared judicially to be invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision
shall not have the effect of invalidating or voiding the remainder of this
Agreement, it being the intent and agreement of the Parties that this
Agreement shall be deemed amended by modifying such provision to the extent
necessary and reasonable to render it valid, legal and enforceable while
preserving its intent or, if such modification is not possible, by
substituting therefor another provision that is valid, legal and enforceable
and that reasonably achieves the same objective.   SECTION 14.6. Entire
Agreement. This Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, and
the documents and instruments executed and delivered in connection herewith)
constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements
and understandings, whether written or oral, among the Parties or any of them
with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no representations,
understandings or agreements relating to the subject matter hereof that are
not fully expressed in this Agreement and the documents and instruments
executed and delivered in connection herewith. All Exhibits and Schedules
attached to this Agreement, and the documents and instruments executed and
delivered in connection herewith, are expressly made a part of,
and incorporated by reference into, this Agreement.   59    SECTION
14.7. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York for contracts made and to
be fully performed in such state, without giving effect to any choice-of-law
rules that may require the application of the laws of
another jurisdiction.   SECTION 14.8. Remedies. Each of the Parties hereto
acknowledges and agrees that (i) the provisions of this Agreement are
reasonable and necessary to protect the proper and legitimate interests of
the other Parties hereto and (ii) the other Parties hereto would be
irreparably damaged in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties hereto shall be entitled
to seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches of
the provisions of this Agreement by other Parties hereto without the
necessity of proving actual damages or of posting any bond, and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof and thereof, which rights shall
be cumulative and in addition to any other remedy to which the Parties hereto
may be entitled hereunder or at law or equity.   SECTION 14.9. Arbitration.
The Sellers, the Company and Buyer agree that all disputes, controversies or
claims that may arise out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof (other than a suit to obtain
specific performance or otherwise compel performance with the provisions of
this Agreement through injunctive relief), shall be submitted to, and
determined by, binding arbitration in accordance with the following
procedures:   (a) Either Buyer or the Sellers may submit a dispute,
controversy or claim to arbitration by giving the other Party written notice
to such effect, which notice shall describe, in reasonable detail, the facts
and legal grounds forming the basis for the filing Party\'s request for
relief. The arbitration shall be held before one neutral arbitrator in
Dallas, Texas.   (b) Within 30 days after the other Party\'s receipt of such
demand, Buyer and the Sellers shall mutually determine who the arbitrator
will be. If the Parties are unable to agree on the arbitrator within that
time period, the arbitrator shall be selected by the American Arbitration
Association ("AAA"). In any event, the arbitrator shall have a background in,
and knowledge of, transactions in the oil and gas industry and shall
otherwise be an appropriate person based on the nature of the dispute. If a
person with experience in such matters is not available, the arbitrator shall
be chosen from the retired federal judges pool maintained by AAA.  
60    (c) The arbitration shall be governed by the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the AAA, except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Section 14.9. However, the arbitration shall be administered by any
organization mutually agreed to in writing by the Parties. If the Parties are
unable to agree on the organization to administer the arbitration, it shall
be administered by the AAA.   (d) Discovery shall be limited to the request
for and production of documents, depositions and interrogatories. All
discovery shall be guided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. All issues
concerning discovery upon which the Parties cannot agree shall be submitted
to the arbitrator for determination.   (e) In rendering an award, the
arbitrator shall determine the rights and obligations of the Parties
according to the substantive and procedural laws of the State of
Delaware.   (f) The decision of, and award rendered by, the arbitrator shall
be determined no more than 30 days after the selection of the arbitrator and
shall be final and binding on the Parties and shall not be subject to appeal.
Judgment on the award may be entered in and enforced by any court of
competent jurisdiction.   (g) Each Party shall bear its own costs and
expenses (including filing fees) with respect to the arbitration, including
one-half of the fees and expenses of the arbitrator.   SECTION 14.10.
Expenses. Each of the Parties hereto shall bear its own expenses (including,
without limitation, fees and disbursements of its counsel, accountants and
other experts) incurred by it in connection with the preparation,
negotiation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, each of
the other documents and instruments executed in connection with
or contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.   SECTION 14.11. Survival. Except as
otherwise set forth in this Agreement, the representations and warranties
made in this Agreement or in any agreement, certificate or other document
executed in connection herewith shall not survive the Closing.   SECTION
14.12. Release of Information. The Parties shall cooperate with each other in
releasing information concerning this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. No press releases or other public announcements
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be made by
any Party without prior consultation with, and agreement of, the other
Parties, except for any legally required communication by any Party and then
only with prior consultation and as much advance notice as is
practicable under the circumstances requiring any announcement, together with
copies of all drafts of the proposed text.   SECTION 14.13. Certain
Construction Rules. The article and section headings and the table of
contents contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only
and shall in no way define, limit, extend or describe the scope or intent of
any provisions of this Agreement. Whenever the context may require, any
pronoun used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine,
feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns, pronouns and verbs
shall include the plural and vice versa. In addition, as used in this
Agreement, unless otherwise provided to the contrary, (a) all references to
days, months or years shall be deemed references to calendar days, months or
years and (b) any reference to a "Section," "Article," "Exhibit,"
or "Schedule" shall be deemed to refer to a section or article of this
Agreement or an exhibit or schedule attached to this Agreement. The words
"hereof," "herein," and "hereunder" and words of similar import referring to
this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. The words "include," "includes," or "including"
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Unless
otherwise specifically provided for herein, the term "or" shall not be deemed
to be exclusive.   61    SECTION 14.14. Counterparts. This Agreement may
be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original and all of which taken together shall constitute one instrument
binding on all the Parties, notwithstanding that all the Parties are not
signatories to the original or the same counterpart.   [signature page
