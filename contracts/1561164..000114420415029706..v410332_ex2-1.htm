4.6   _Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) The Company has provided to Purchaser a correct and complete copy of an

income and cash flows for each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and
2014 (collectively, the "Audited Financial Statements"). The Audited
Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto), are consistent with and were prepared from the books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and fairly present in all
material respects the financial condition, results of its operations and
income and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the respective
dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated, except as otherwise
set forth in the notes thereto. For purposes of this Agreement, the

(b)  The Company has provided to Purchaser a correct and
complete copy of the unaudited consolidated __ balance sheet of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for the three (3) month period ended March 31, 2015,

Statements, the "Financial Statements"). The Unaudited Financial Statements
were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout
the periods involved (except as may be indicated in any notes thereto), are
consistent with and were prepared from the books and records of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, and fairly present in all material respects the
financial condition, results of its operations and income and cash flows of
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the
respective periods indicated, except that the Unaudited Financial Statements
do not contain notes and are subject to normal year-end adjustments (none of
which would be materially adverse).

  



  

(c)  The Company and its Subsidiaries maintain books and
records accurately reflecting their material assets and material
liabilities and a system of internal controls that management reasonably
believes is sufficient to ensure that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability,
and to provide adequate assurance that material transactions and access to
assets are authorized only by management. Company and its Subsidiaries do not
maintain any off-the-book accounts. The Company has disclosed to Purchaser
any known or, to the knowledge of the Company, alleged fraud, respecting the
Company and its Subsidiaries within the past three (3) years that involves
management or other employees who have had a significant role in the Company's
or its Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting.

  



  

(d)  The accounts receivable reflected on the Financial
Statements derive from bona fide sales transactions entered into in
the ordinary course of business and are payable on the terms and conditions
set forth in the applicable Contract to which they relate, subject to
appropriate reserves for doubtful accounts. The amount carried for doubtful
accounts and allowances disclosed in the Financial Statements was calculated
in accordance with GAAP and in a manner consistent with prior periods. All
accounts payable of the Company and its Subsidiaries reflected on the
Financial Statements or arising thereafter derive from bona fide
transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business and have been
paid or are not yet due or payable.

  



  

4.7   _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations, whether accrued or
unaccrued, absolute, fixed, or contingent, or otherwise, whether due or to
become due, other than (a) liabilities that are set forth on _Section 4.7_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter, (b) liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against in the Financial Statements, and (c) liabilities that have been
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with practice since

consistent with past practice, except for the negotiation, execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents, (b)

individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as

change in the accounting methods or practices of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries except as required or permitted by law or GAAP and (d) except as

2015 none of the Seller, the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company, nor
any of their respective Affiliates has taken, or caused or permitted to be
taken, or agreed or committed to take, any action that, were it taken prior
to the Closing Date, would constitute a breach of any subsection of _Section
6.1(a)_ through _(f)_ , _(h)_ through _(m)_ and _(o)_.

  



  

4.9   _Litigation_. Except as disclosed in _Section 4.9_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, there is no claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation ("Proceeding") pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i) by or before
any Governmental Authority or arbitrator that seeks to restrain or enjoin the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) which
could reasonably be expected, either singularly or in the aggregate with all
such claims, actions or proceedings, to create any material impediment to or
restriction on the (A) operation or conduct of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in the ordinary course, or (B)
ability of the Parties hereto to consummate the Acquisition.

  



  

4.10   _Compliance with Law; Permits_.

  



  

(a) Since January 1, 2012, the Company and its Subsidiaries have operated in
all material respects in compliance with all applicable Legal
Requirements. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has since
January 1, 2012, been cited, fined or otherwise notified in writing of any
violation or alleged violation of any Legal Requirement, except for such
violations or alleged violations that have been paid, cured or otherwise
resolved prior to the date of this Agreement without any continuing obligation
or liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Since January 1,
2012, no Governmental Authority has indicated in writing an intention to
conduct any investigation or review with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective assets and properties (other than
ordinary course or standard periodic reviews) or issued any written notice of
any material non-compliance with applicable Legal Requirements. None of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been cited, fined or otherwise notified
of any failure to comply with any applicable Legal Requirements resulting in
a material liability that has not been paid or cured. All material
reports required to be filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
any Governmental Authority have been timely filed and were accurate and
complete in all material respects when so filed.

and (c) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Parties shall have the right (but not the obligation) to supplement or amend
Company Disclosure Letter and Purchaser Disclosure Letter (the "Disclosure
Letters") being delivered concurrently with the execution of this Agreement
and annexed hereto with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered
which, if existing or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to be set forth or described in the Disclosure Letters.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such amendment or supplement shall effect
or limit the indemnification obligation of the Parties under _Article IX_ ,
nor shall any such amendment or supplement effect the representations and
warranties of the Parties for purposes of _Sections 8.2(a)_ and _8.3(a)_.

  



  

7.5   _Employees and Benefits_.

  



  

(a)  For a period of at least two (2) months after the Closing
Date, except in the case of termination for cause, Purchaser shall cause the
Company, or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to continue to employ ninety
percent (90%) of all employees who are employed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (including, without limitation, those on
temporary layoffs or approved leaves of absence) on terms and conditions
substantially equivalent to the terms and conditions of employment then
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries, including, without limitation,
wages, compensation and employee benefits, that are substantially comparable
in the aggregate to those provided immediately before the Closing Date.
Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, none of Purchaser, the Company
or their Subsidiaries shall modify or amend the terms and conditions of
employment of such Employees in any material respect for a period of (i) six
(6) months after the Closing Date; or (ii) with respect to employees party to
an employment or severance agreement, for the duration of the term of
employment specified therein. To the extent that Working Capital as of
Closing included accruals for the pro rated portion of any 2015 employee bonus
or paid time off with respect to any such Employee, Purchaser shall pay (or,
in the case of paid time off, pay or give credit for) such pro rated bonus or
paid time off to such Employee in the ordinary course as and when payments of
bonuses and paid time off are made to other Purchaser employees. To the
extent such Employees do not remain employees of Purchaser, the Company or its
Subsidiaries as of such time, then the portion of the accrued bonus amount
otherwise payable to them should instead be paid as an additional bonus to one
or more other Employees of the Company as of the Closing Date.

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing
contained in this _Section 7.5_ shall (i) confer any rights, remedies, or
claims upon any Employees, and (ii) be considered to be an amendment of any
Company Plan or Material Employee Agreement.

  



  

(c)  Purchaser shall be liable for any liability incurred on or
after the Closing Date under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act of 1988 ("WARN") and all other applicable
foreign, federal state and local laws, including those prohibiting
discrimination and requiring notice to employees. Purchaser shall not, and
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to, at any time prior to
sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass
layoff" as those terms are defined in WARN affecting in whole or in part any
facility, site of employment, operating unit or employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries without complying fully with the requirements of WARN.
Purchaser will bear the cost of compliance with (or failure to comply with)
any such laws.

  



  

(d)  Within thirty (30) days of the date hereof, the Company and
Seller shall provide to Purchaser its analysis of any payments or benefits to
be made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that may constitute a "parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section
280(g)(b)(2)(A) of the Code). In the event such analysis determines that any
payments or benefits constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of
Section 280(g)(b)(2)(A) of the Code), the Company and Seller shall submit for
stockholder and member approval, as applicable, in a manner intended to
satisfy the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the
applicable rulings and final regulations thereunder, any payments and/or
benefits to the extent necessary so that no payments or benefits would be
"excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Code ("Section 280G Payments"), and so that the deduction of such payments or
benefits will not be limited by the application of Section 280G of the Code
and the applicable rulings and final regulations thereunder. Prior to the
Closing, Seller and the Company shall deliver to Purchaser certification that
either (a) the stockholder and member votes were solicited in conformity with
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the applicable rulings and final
regulations thereunder and the requisite Company stockholder and Seller
member approvals were obtained with respect to the Section 280G Payments, or
(b) the Company stockholder and/or Seller member approvals of Section 280G
Payments were not obtained and that, as a consequence, the payments and/or
benefits that were subject to stockholder and member approval shall not be
made or provided to the extent that they would cause any amount to constitute
Section 280G Payments. If necessary, Seller and the Company shall obtain
waivers from all applicable executives prior to the stockholder and member
votes described in this _Section 7.5(d)_.

7.6   _Certain Financial Information; Cooperation_.

  



  

(a)  Within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar
month between the date hereof and the earlier of (x) the Closing Date and (y)
the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article X_
, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser the unaudited consolidated financial
statements of Company and its Subsidiaries for such month, including a balance
sheet, statement of operations and statement of income and cash flows, that
are certified by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company as (i)
prepared in accordance with the GAAP applied on a consistent basis to prior
periods (except as may be indicated in any notes thereto), (ii) consistent
with and prepared from the books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and (iii) fairly presenting in all material respects the
financial condition, results of its operations and income and cash flows of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for
the respective periods indicated, except that such statements need not contain
notes and may be subject to normal year-end adjustments (none of which would
be material).

  



  

(b)  The Parties acknowledge and agree that in connection with
the Acquisition, QTS Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation and the
general partner of the OP ("QTS") may determine to prepare and file a
prospectus supplement (which prospectus supplement will comply in all
material respects with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC) (the
"Supplement") to its existing Prospectus dated November 25, 2014. During the
Interim Period, at the request of the Purchaser Seller will provide and shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide QTS with such information
relating to it and the Company and its Subsidiaries as is required by the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the respective rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Supplement (together, the
"Company Information") and Seller will and will cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to promptly take all such other actions (including using its
reasonable efforts to obtain any required consents of its independent
auditors), as may reasonably be requested by Purchaser in order to permit the
filing of the Supplement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Supplement
containing any of the Company Information shall be filed with the SEC or
otherwise publicly disseminated unless and until the Purchaser has confirmed
to the Seller in writing that: (i) the Purchaser is ready, willing and able to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) all
conditions to the obligations of the Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (including all Required Consents but
excluding the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1(a)_ and _(b)_  and
_Section 8.3(d)_ and the conditions which, by their nature, are to be
satisfied as of the Closing) have been satisfied or waived, and that it has
received all Required Consents and (iii) to the knowledge of the Purchaser as
of such date of filing or public dissemination, no Event has occurred,
including without limitation any Event that has resulted in a breach of any
representation or warranty of the Seller or the Company and its Subsidiaries,
that constitutes a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(c)  During the Interim Period, the Seller shall, and shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective employees, accountants and other advisors to, reasonably cooperate
with prospective financing sources, underwriters, placement agents or initial
purchasers in performing their reasonable due diligence (including providing
information required by applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations). Nothing in this Agreement shall require
any cooperation to the extent it would (i) require any officer of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, to execute or deliver any document or certificate in
connection with any securities offering of the Purchaser or its Affiliates
prior to the Closing; (ii) require any counsel for the Company or its
Subsidiaries to deliver any opinion in connection with any such securities
offering; or (iii) unreasonably or materially interfere with the ongoing
business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(d)  To the extent not otherwise delivered to Purchaser in
accordance with this Agreement, Seller shall make commercially
reasonable efforts to retain all of its existing books and records relating
to the Financial Statements for the three (3) year period prior to Closing
(the "Past Audit Period") for no less than eighteen (18) months after the
Closing and (ii) make the same available to Purchaser for such eighteen (18)
month period after the Closing for inspection, copying, audit, and filing
(including, without limitation, any publication required pursuant to such
filing provided that Auditor's (as defined below) consent is also obtained)
by Purchaser or the Auditor to the extent required by the SEC, the New York
Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") or pursuant to other applicable federal or state
securities laws, rules or regulations in connection with any filings
Purchaser or its Affiliates are required to make with the SEC, NYSE, or
pursuant to other applicable federal or state securities laws, rules or
regulations (other than materials subject to the attorney-client privilege),
provided that such activities do not unreasonably or materially interfere
with the conduct of the business of Seller or its Affiliates, and (iii)
cooperate in all reasonable respects with the efforts of Purchaser and its
Affiliates to prepare audited financial statements, including footnotes to
such audited financial statements, for the Past Audit Period, to the extent
not previously provided. Seller shall provide a management
representations letter relating to the Past Audit Period in customary form,
as required by Purchaser's accountants, which shall be Ernst and Young LLP or
another nationally recognized accounting firm (the "Auditor"), in connection
with any such audit. The terms of this Section 7.6(d) shall survive the
Closing.

  



  

(e)  Purchaser shall either pay on behalf of the Seller, the
Company or its Subsidiaries or reimburse Seller promptly for (x) all out of
pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Seller, the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with their compliance with this _Section 7.6_ ,
together with (y) all out of pocket costs and expenses which Seller, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries incurs in connection with the collection
of such reimbursement, including all reasonable attorney's fees and
disbursements relating thereto. It is acknowledged and agreed that if any
such costs or expenses of the Company or its Subsidiaries have neither been
paid by the Company or its Subsidiaries nor reimbursed by the Purchaser
pursuant to this clause (e) on or prior to the Closing Date, then all such
costs and expenses shall be excluded from the current liabilities of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and no such costs or expenses shall be taken in
to consideration in the determination of Estimated Working Capital or Final
Working Capital. The Purchaser\'s obligation to reimburse Seller under this
Section 7.6(e) shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 9.4 of this Agreement. The terms of this Section 7.6(e) shall survive
the Closing.

7.7   _Access to Financial Information_. Seller shall, and shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, (a) afford Purchaser and its
financial advisors, accountants, counsel and other representatives reasonable
access (i) to the Company's and its Subsidiaries' financial information used
in the preparation of its Audited Financial Statements and Unaudited Financial
Statements and the financial information furnished pursuant to _Section 7.6_
hereof and (ii) the executive and financial personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries responsible for the preparation of such financial information;
and (b) reasonably cooperate with any reviews performed of any such financial
statements or information by Purchaser or its financial advisors,
accountants, counsel and other representatives.

  



  

7.8   _Antitrust_.

  



  

(a)  As promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, each of Purchaser and Seller shall begin to prepare and in no
event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof (subject to
extension as set forth below), Purchaser and Seller shall each file (or, if
applicable, cause its Ultimate Parent Entity, as defined under the HSR Act, to
prepare and file) any notification required of it thereunder in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall promptly and in
good faith respond to all information requested of it by the Federal Trade
Commission and Department of Justice in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise cooperate in good
faith with each other and such Governmental Entities. Purchaser and Seller
shall (or, if applicable, shall cause its Ultimate Parent Entity, to) (a)
request early termination of all waiting periods under the HSR Act; (b)
promptly inform the other of any material communication to or from the Federal
Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other Governmental
Authority regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (c) give
the other prompt notice of the commencement of any action, suit, litigation,
arbitration, proceeding or investigation by or before any Governmental
Authority with respect to such transactions; and (d) keep the other reasonably
informed as to the status of any such action, suit, litigation, arbitration,
proceeding or investigation. Filing fees with respect to the notifications
required under the HSR Act shall be paid by Purchaser. The ten (10) Business
Day period set forth the above shall be extended to the extent the Parties
are continuing to, and have been continually, diligently working to prepare
and file such notification.

  



  

(b)  In addition to the foregoing, Purchaser and Seller shall
cooperate to make, as promptly as practicable, and in any event within the
twelve (12) Business Days after the date of this Agreement (subject to
extension as provided below), such filings, applications and reports, and
respond to any request for supplemental information related thereto, as deemed
advisable by the parties pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, if any,
governing non-U.S. antitrust, competition or merger control approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Foreign Antitrust Approval").
The twelve (12) Business Day period set forth the above shall be extended to
the extent the parties are continuing to, and have been continually,
diligently working to prepare and make such filings, applications and
reports.

  



  

(c)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
Party shall provide to the other (or the other's respective advisors) upon
request copies of all correspondence between such party and any Governmental
Authority relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary, designate any competitively
sensitive materials provided to the other under this _Section 7.8_ as
"outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the
recipient without the advance written consent of the party providing such
materials. In addition, to the extent reasonably practicable, all substantive
discussions, substantive telephone calls, and meetings with a
Governmental Authority regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall include representatives of both parties. Subject to
applicable law, the parties will consult and cooperate with each other in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, and proposals made or submitted to any Governmental Authority
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by or on behalf of
any Party.

7.9   _Required Consents_. As soon as practicable (but in any
event within thirty (30) days) after the date hereof and prior to the Closing
Date, Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Required
Consents.

  



  

7.10   _Tax Matters; Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_.

  



  

(a)  The Seller shall have the right and obligation to timely
prepare and file, or cause the Company to timely prepare and file, when due
any Tax Return that is required to be filed with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries for Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date,
regardless of whether such Tax Returns are due after the Closing Date
(collectively the "Company Tax Returns"). Seller shall cause all Taxes shown
as due with respect to the Company Tax Returns to be timely paid by the due
date thereof to the applicable Governmental Authority as provided in and
subject to the provisions of Section 7.10(b) below. The Purchaser shall have
the right and obligation to timely prepare and file, or cause to be timely
prepared and filed, when due, all other Tax Returns that are required to be
filed after the Closing Date ("Purchaser Tax Returns"). All Company Tax
Returns and all Straddle Period Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with prior practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries except as
otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements. Prior to the filing of
any Company Tax Returns or Straddle Period Tax Returns, the party responsible
for preparing such returns shall provide a copy of each such return to
the other party (the non-preparing party) for the non-preparing party's
review and consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned, at least, in the case of income Tax Returns, 30 days prior to the
due date (including extensions) for filing such income Tax Returns, and with
respect to non-income Tax Returns, a reasonable time prior to the filing of
such non-income Tax Returns. In connection with any Straddle Period Tax
Return, the Purchaser shall also deliver to the Seller an allocation of Taxes
of any Straddle Period shown to be due on any Straddle Period Tax Return
allocated between the pre-closing and post-closing Tax periods, and shall use
commercially reasonable best efforts to provide such allocation to Seller
within a reasonable period of time prior to the due date (including
extensions) for filing of such portions of the Straddle Period for review and
approval. If the Seller disputes any item set forth on a Straddle Period Tax
Return or the allocation schedule with respect to Straddle Period Taxes prior
to the due date of such Straddle Period Tax Return, such return may be filed
as prepared by the Purchaser and the issue shall be resolved in the same
manner as Disputed Matters in _Section 2.3_ , and following such resolution,
appropriate amended returns shall be prepared and filed by the Company as
necessary to reflect the determinations made by the Independent Auditor. The
Independent Auditor expenses shall be shared equally between the Seller and
the Purchaser.

(b)  Seller shall promptly, but in no event later than ten (10)
days after demand for payment by Purchaser, reimburse the Company, initially
by way of disbursement to the Company out of the balance of the Indemnity
Escrow Funds until such Indemnity Escrow Funds are exhausted, for all income
Taxes and all payroll Taxes, as well as the reasonable out of pocket costs of
preparation and filing of Tax Returns with respect thereto (to the extent
prepared and filed by the Company) with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and, in the case of income Taxes only,
at any time after the Indemnity Escrow Funds are exhausted, out of its own
funds). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including
this _Section 7.10(b)_ or _Article IX_ ), Seller shall have no liability
under this Agreement with respect to (and Purchaser shall pay or cause to be
paid) (w) any Taxes included as liabilities in the calculation of Final
Working Capital, (x) Taxes incurred by the Company and/or any
Subsidiaries, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates as a result of
actions taken by Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof outside the
ordinary course after the Closing (y) Taxes incurred after the Closing Date
attributable to Post-Closing Tax Periods or (z) any breach by Purchaser of
any provision in _Section 7.10_ and _Section 7.11_. To the extent not paid by
Seller or the Company prior to Closing, but subject to the Seller's
reimbursement obligations set forth in this paragraph (b), the Purchaser shall
timely pay or cause to be timely paid all Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

  



  

(c)  The Purchaser agrees to furnish or cause to be furnished
to the Seller as promptly as reasonably practicable, such
information (including access to books and records) and reasonable assistance
(including the execution of powers of attorney) relating to the Company as is
reasonably necessary for the preparation and filing of any Tax Return
contemplated by this _Section 7.10_ and shall cause a duly authorized
representative to sign such Tax Returns or otherwise provide the requisite
powers of attorney.

  



  

(d)  Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries not to, (i) make any amendment of any Tax Returns of the
Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) to the extent such Tax Return relates to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or to the extent such amendment would otherwise
adversely affect Seller without Seller\'s prior written consent or (ii) make
any election that has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
that would otherwise adversely affect Seller without Seller's prior
written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably, withheld, conditioned,
or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall be entitled to take
any of the actions described in (i) or (ii) of this _Section 7.10(d)_ without
Seller's consent if Purchaser agrees to be responsible for any increase in
Tax caused by Purchaser's actions with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
to which such action relates.

  



  

(e)  Any refunds (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
overpayments of estimated Taxes) of or credits against Taxes (including any
interest paid or credited with respect thereto) of, or with respect to, the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries that are attributable or allocable to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period will be for the benefit of Seller subject to
Purchaser's right to set-off any such amounts for Taxes attributable to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period that have not been paid or reimbursed pursuant to
_Section 7.10(b)_ or _Section 9.1(a)(iii)_ or with respect to Transfer Taxes.
Purchaser will, subject to its right of set-off, pay the amount of any such
refunds (whether received as a refund or as a credit against or an offset of
Taxes otherwise payable) to Seller within ten (10) days of receipt or
utilization thereof, whichever is applicable. Purchaser will, if Seller so
requests, cause the relevant entity to file for and obtain any refunds or
credit to which Seller may be entitled hereunder. Purchaser will permit
Seller to control (at Seller's expense and sole discretion) the prosecution
and content of any such refund or credit, whichever applicable. Purchaser
will, if Seller so requests, cause the relevant entity to file for and obtain
any refunds or credit to which Seller may be entitled hereunder; provided,
however, (i) Seller shall be responsible for any out of pocket costs and
expenses of Purchaser related to the preparation, filing, and review of such
claim for refund or credit, and (ii) Seller requests Purchaser to file such
claim for refund or credit prior to December 31, 2016. Purchaser will permit
Seller to control (at Seller's expense and sole discretion) the prosecution
of any such claim for refund or credit, whichever applicable, however,
Purchaser shall be entitled to fully participate in any such proceeding at
its own expense and by engaging counsel of its choosing.  Regardless of
whether Purchaser participates in a proceeding related to a claim for refund
or credit, Seller shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed of the status of
such proceeding and provide copies of all notices and other communications
with respect thereto.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Seller shall not be permitted to cause the Purchaser, Company, or such
other relevant entity to make a claim for refund or credit as described in
this _Section 7.10(e)_ if the filing of such claim would adversely affect the
Purchaser in a Post-Closing Tax Period, including, but not limited to, by
increasing a Tax liability in a Post-Closing Tax Period (other than if such
effect arises solely from a carry back or utilization of a net operating loss
attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period but only with respect to net
operating loss amounts generated from deductions related to the
Company Transaction Expenses, Option Cash Payment Amounts, or Sales Bonus
Amounts, as and to the extent actually reflected on (a) a Post-Closing Period
Tax Return or (b) a Pre-Closing Period Tax Return).

--- 

    



  

(f)  All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other such Taxes ("Transfer Taxes"), and all conveyance fees, recording
charges and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the consummation of the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser and
fifty percent (50%) by Seller. Purchaser shall file all necessary
documentation and Tax Returns with respect to such Taxes.

  



  

(g)   _No Code Section 338 Election_. Purchaser shall not make,
or permit to be made, any election under Section 338 of the Code or any
similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Tax law with respect to the
Company or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(h)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section
7.10_ , the parties acknowledge that the limitations contained in _Section
9.4_ shall apply to any indemnification claim by Purchaser in respect of an
inaccuracy or breach of a representation and warranty in _Section 4.15_.

  



  

7.11   _Tax Disputes; Assistance and Cooperation_.

  



  

(a)  In the event that either Party (or in the case of
Purchaser, the Company) receives notice from any Governmental Authority of
any proposed audit, claim, assessment or other dispute concerning an amount of
Taxes with respect to which the other Party (or in the case of Purchaser, the
Company) may incur liability hereunder, such Party shall promptly notify the
other Party of such matter. Such notice shall contain factual information (to
the extent known) describing any asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail
and shall be accompanied by copies of any notice or other documents received
from any Tax authority with respect to such matter. If either Party (or in
the case of Purchaser, the Company), receives written notice of an asserted
Tax liability with respect to a matter for which it has a right to
indemnification or reimbursement pursuant to this Agreement (and the other
Party does not have knowledge of the asserted Tax liability) and fails to
provide the other Party with prompt notice thereof after actual receipt of
such written notice and as a result such other Party is precluded from
contesting the asserted Tax liability in the applicable forum as a result of
such failure to notify, then such other (indemnifying) Party shall be relieved
of its indemnification or reimbursement obligations with respect to such
asserted Tax liability.

  



  

   

62 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b)  The Seller shall have the right, at its own expense and by
engaging counsel of its choosing, to elect in writing (such writing to be
provided to Purchaser prior to the commencement of any audit, dispute,
administrative, judicial or other proceeding related to Pre-Closing Tax
Period Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ("Tax Dispute")) to
control a Tax Dispute with respect to which it may incur liability to
Purchaser or the Company under this Agreement; Purchaser shall be entitled to
fully participate in such Tax Dispute at its own expense and by engaging
counsel of its choosing. Regardless of which Party controls a tax Dispute,
Purchaser shall have the right to consent to any settlement with respect to
such Tax Dispute (provided such consent cannot be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned). To the extent Seller fails to use commercially
reasonably efforts to control or defend any such Tax Dispute, Purchaser shall
assume control of such Tax Dispute at the expense of Seller.

  



  

(c)  If Seller does not control a Tax Dispute relating to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller shall be entitled to participate fully in the
portion of any such Tax Dispute that is related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
and Purchaser shall not agree to settle (or permit the Company (or any
Subsidiary thereof) to settle) any such Tax Dispute without Seller's written
consent (provided such consent cannot be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

  



  

(d)  The Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other,
shall cooperate (and cause their Affiliates to cooperate) with each other and
with each other's agents, including accounting firms and legal counsel, in
connection with any Tax Dispute. Such cooperation shall include each Party
making all information and documents in its possession relating to the Company
available to the other Party. The Parties shall retain all Tax Returns,
schedules, and work papers, and all material records and other
documents relating thereto, until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (including, to the extent noticed by any Party, any extensions
thereof) of the Tax period to which such Tax Returns and other documents and
information relate. Each of the Parties shall also make available to the
other Party, as reasonably requested and available, personnel (including
officers, directors, employees, and agents) responsible for preparing,
maintaining, and interpreting information and documents relevant to Taxes,
and personnel reasonably required as witnesses or for purposes of providing
information or documents in connection with any administrative or judicial
proceeding relating to Taxes. Any information or documents provided under this
Agreement shall be kept confidential by the Party receiving such information
or documents, except as may otherwise be necessary in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or in connection with a Tax Dispute.

(e)  All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements with
respect to or involving the Company and any of its Subsidiaries shall be
terminated as of the Closing and, after Closing, the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries shall not be bound by nor have any liabilities under any such
agreements (whether for the current year, a past year or a future year).

  



  

(f)  To the extent of any inconsistency between any provision
of _Section 7.10 _or _Section_ 7.11 and _Article IX_ , the provisions of
_Section 7.10_ or _Section_ 7.11, as the case may be, shall control.

  



  

7.12   _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

  



  

(a)  For six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, each of
Purchaser and the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless all past and
present officers and directors of the Company and of the Subsidiaries
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the individuals included in the
definition of Company's knowledge) to the same extent such persons are
currently indemnified by the Company pursuant to the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation and By-Laws (but subject to the limitations contained therein)
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date, and Purchaser

provision in the Company's or a Subsidiary's certificate of incorporation,
by-laws, articles of organization, written declaration, certificate of
limited partnership or limited partnership agreement relating to the

officers, employees or agents of any the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, unless such modification is required by applicable Legal
Requirements. In addition to the other rights provided for in this

Charter Documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, (i)
indemnify and hold harmless (and release from any liability to Purchaser, the
Company or its Subsidiaries), the individuals who, on or prior the Closing
Date, were officers, directors, or employees or agents of the Company or the
Subsidiaries or served on behalf of the Company as an officer, director or
employee or agent of any of the Company's current or former subsidiaries
(collectively, "Covered Affiliates") or any of their predecessors in all of
their capacities (including as member or equityholder, controlling or
otherwise) and the heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries and administrators
of such officer, directors or employees or agents (each a "DandO Indemnitee"
and, collectively, the "DandO Indemnitees") against all DandO Expenses (as
defined below), losses, claims, damages, judgments or amounts paid in
settlement ("DandO Costs") in respect of any threatened, pending or completed
claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or
investigative, based on or arising out of or relating to the fact that such
Person is or was a director, officer, employee, or equityholder
(controlling or otherwise) of the Company or the Subsidiaries or Covered
Affiliates or any of their predecessors arising out of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing (including without limitation,
in respect of acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby) (a "DandO Indemnifiable Claim"), except for
intentional acts or omissions which involve conduct known to such Person at
the time to constitute a material violation of applicable law and
(ii) advance to such DandO Indemnitees all DandO Expenses incurred in connection
with any DandO Indemnifiable Claim (including in circumstances where the DandO
Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of such claim) promptly after
receipt of reasonably detailed statements therefor. Any DandO Indemnifiable
Claims shall continue until such DandO Indemnifiable Claim is disposed of or
all judgments, orders, decrees or other rulings in connection with such DandO
Indemnifiable Claim are fully satisfied. For the purposes of this _Section
7.12(a)_ , "DandO Expenses" shall include reasonable attorneys' fees and all
other reasonable costs, charges and expenses paid or incurred in connection
with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in
(including on appeal), or preparing to defend, to be a witness in or
participate in any DandO Indemnifiable Claim, but shall exclude losses,
judgments and amounts paid in settlement (which items are included in the

purchase and maintain from and after the Effective Time and for a period of
up to six (6) years following the Closing Date (as elected by Seller),
directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those persons who are
currently covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy on terms not less favorable than such existing insurance
coverage; _provided_ , that (i) in no event shall Purchaser, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries be obligated to pay annual premiums for such insurance
in excess of 300% of the most recent annual premiums paid by Seller, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for such coverage to the extent any
such coverage is currently maintained ("Purchaser's Portion"), and (i) in the
event that any claim is brought under such director's and officer's liability
insurance policy, such claim shall be maintained until final
disposition thereof. To the extent such premiums are paid by the Company as
of or prior to Effective Time, the amount thereof up to the
Purchaser's Portion shall be deemed added to Final Cash, and to the extent
such premiums are paid by the Purchaser or the Company after the Effective
Time, the amount thereof in excess of the Purchaser's Portion shall be
deducted from Final Cash. To the extent the aggregate premiums in respect of
such insurance policy exceeds the Purchaser\'s Portion, such (if paid after
the Closing) shall be paid by the Company but shall be added to Company
Transaction Expenses.

Seller agrees to transfer by wire transfer of immediately available funds a
portion of such Seller Reserve Amount Distribution to the Company equal to
the Aggregate Option Holder Pro Rata Share thereof plus the employer portion
of any employment Taxes payable with respect thereto. The Company agrees to
distribute such amount to the individuals set forth on the Option Allocation
Schedule, whether or not such individual is an Employee of the Company at
such time, in accordance with each such individual's Option Holder Pro Rata

such amounts, and subject to any required Tax withholding.

Governmental Authority making such request to determine what other or
additional information could be provided as would not violate applicable Legal
Requirements and would satisfy such Governmental Authority with respect to
such information or document request and shall promptly provide
such information.

  



  

(c)  Each of Purchaser\'s and Seller\'s requirement to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the requisite approvals from DSS
shall include (i) promptly making any notification filings required in
connection with the DSS approval, (ii) providing any information requested by
DSS in connection with its review of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement consistent with the NISPOM and related guidance, (iii) taking such
actions and agreeing to such restrictions as may be requested by DSS in
connection with, or as a condition of, DSS approval as may be required to
mitigate any national security concern including, for the avoidance of doubt,
governance, reporting and/or third party monitoring.

Transaction.

9.2   _Indemnification of Seller_.

  



  

(a)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article IX_
(including without limitation the limitations set forth in  _Section 9.4_ ),
Seller and its officers, managers, representatives, successors and permitted

9.3   _Defense of Claims_.

  



  

(a) In the event that any Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee shall
sustain or incur any Losses in respect of which indemnification may be
sought by such party pursuant to this _Article IX_ , the party seeking such
indemnification (the "Indemnitee") shall assert a claim for indemnification
by giving prompt written notice thereof (the "Notice"), which shall describe
in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances upon which the asserted claim
for indemnification is based, to the party providing indemnification (the
"Indemnitor") and shall thereafter keep the Indemnitor fully informed with
respect thereto; provided that failure of the Indemnitee to give the
Indemnitor prompt notice as provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnitor
of any of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnitor
is materially prejudiced by such failure. In case any third party claim,
action or proceeding is brought against any Indemnitee in respect of which
indemnification may be sought by the Indemnitee pursuant to this _Article IX_
(a "Claim"), the Indemnitor shall have the right to assume, conduct and
control the defense, compromise or settlement thereof, by written notice to
the Indemnitee of its intention to do so within thirty (30) days after
receipt of the Notice, at the Indemnitor's own expense, and thereupon to
prosecute in the name and on behalf of the Indemnitee any available cross-
claims, counter-claims or third-party claims arising with respect to the
Claim and the Indemnitee and its Affiliates shall cooperate with Indemnitor in
the defense of such Claim and make all relevant personnel and books and
records available to Indemnitor as reasonably requested. If the Indemnitor
shall assume the defense of such Claim, it shall not settle such Claim unless
such settlement includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the
claimant or the plaintiff of a release of the Indemnitee, reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitee, from all liability with respect to such
Claim. Notwithstanding the assumption by the Indemnitor of the defense of any
Claim as provided in this _Section 9.3(a)_ , and without limiting the
Indemnitor's right to assume, conduct and control the defense, compromise or
settlement thereof, the Indemnitee shall be permitted to join in the defense
of such Claim and to employ counsel at its own expense.

  



  

   

71 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b)  If the Indemnitor shall fail to notify the Indemnitee of
its desire to assume the defense of any such Claim within the
prescribed thirty (30) day period set forth in _Section 9.3(a)_, or shall
notify the Indemnitee that it will not assume the defense of any such Claim,
or if the Indemnitor shall fail to conduct the defense of any such Claim in
good faith and at its expense, and such failure continues for more than ten
(10) days after written notice thereof from the Indemnitee to the Indemnitor,
then the Indemnitee may assume the defense of any such Claim in the place of
the Indemnitor by giving written notice to the Indemnitor, in which event it
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to the conduct the defense of such
Claim, and the Indemnitor shall be bound by any determinations made in any
litigation with respect to such Claim or any settlement thereof effected by
the Indemnitee, which settlement has been approved by Indemnitor (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
provided that any such determinations or settlement shall not affect the
right of the Indemnitor to dispute the Indemnitee's claim for indemnification
under the terms of _Section 9.3(c)_ below.

  



  

(c)  Indemnitor shall have the right to review and verify any
Loss or claim asserted by Indemnitee under this _Article IX_.

  



  

9.4   _Limitations on Indemnification_.

  



  

(a)   _Survival: Time Limitation_. The representations and
warranties and covenants to be performed prior to the Closing and set forth
in this Agreement or in any writing delivered in a certificate by one Party to
another Party in connection with this Agreement shall survive the Closing for
a period of fifteen (15) months following the Closing Date, and the covenants
and agreements set forth in this Agreement to be performed after the Closing
shall survive until fully performed and claims for breach related thereto
shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations;
it being expressly agreed, however, that claims for Taxes pursuant to
_Section 7.10_ or pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(iii)_ , other than in respect of
income Taxes (which claims shall survive indefinitely), shall survive for a
period of fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date. No claim for
indemnification under this _Article IX_ shall be brought by any Party after
the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in this _Section
9.4(a)_.

  



  

(b)   _Preservation of Claims_. Any claim set forth in a Notice
that has been delivered in accordance with the foregoing time frame, as
applicable, shall survive until final resolution thereof.

  



  

(c)   _Minor Claims; Deductible_. No amount shall be payable by
Seller under _Section 9.1(a)(i)_ , (i) if, with respect to any individual
item or series of related items of indemnifiable Loss, such item(s) is less
than Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) ("Minor Claim"); (ii) with
respect to Claims under _Section 4.15_ , unless and until the
aggregate amount of all indemnifiable Losses (excluding any and all Minor
Claims) otherwise payable exceeds $750,000 (the "Special Deductible"), and
(iii) with respect to all other claims (other than claims with respect to
Fundamental Representations), unless and until the aggregate amount of all
indemnifiable Losses (excluding any and all Minor Claims) otherwise payable
exceeds One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000) (the "Regular
Deductible"), in which event the amount payable by Seller shall include only
Losses in excess of the Special Deductible or the Regular Deductible, as the
case may be, and all future amounts that become payable under _Section
9.1(a)(i)_, as applicable, from time to time thereafter.

  



  

   

72 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(d)   _Other Limitations_. In connection with the Losses that
are subject to a claim for indemnification pursuant to this  _Article IX_ ,
the Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file (or cause the
Company to file) an insurance claim or pursue any other indemnity or
contribution rights it or the Company may have against third parties to seek
to obtain maximum recovery under such insurance or against such third
parties. In the event the insurance company or other third party contests
such claim, then the Indemnitor shall have the right to assume the
prosecution of such claim and in such event the Indemnitee shall fully
cooperate with Indemnitor; provided any reasonable out of pocket costs
incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such cooperation shall be fully
reimbursable by Indemnitor. Indemnification for each Loss for which either
Party, but for this _Section 9.4(d)_ , would be liable under _Section 9.1_ or
_9.2_ , shall be reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds, and any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment, paid or payable to the
Seller, Company, Purchaser, any Seller Indemnitee or any
Purchaser Indemnitee, as applicable, by any third party with respect to such
Loss, in each case net of any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
collecting such proceeds or payments. The amount constituting the claim for
which indemnification may be made pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be
reduced by any Tax savings which is actually realized by indemnified party or
any Affiliate thereof in the year of the payment or which may be realizable
in the immediately following year from any loss, deduction or credit with
respect to such Losses calculated by the positive difference, if any, between
(i) indemnified party's or its Affiliate's Tax liability without regard to
such Loss and (ii) indemnified party's or its Affiliate's Tax liability taking
into account such Loss.

  



  

(e)   _Amount Limitation and Source of Indemnity_. Except in
respect of any Loss in connection with (i) claims for income Taxes with
respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods in accordance with _Section 7.10_ hereof
and _Section 9.1(a)(iii)_ and (ii) claims arising from fraud or intentional
breach of this Agreement, Seller's aggregate liability for Losses pursuant to
_Section 9.1(a)_ shall not in any event exceed the Indemnity Escrow Funds, and
the Purchaser Indemnitees shall have no claim against Seller under _Section
9.1(a)_ other than a claim against the then remaining and unreleased amount of
the Indemnity Escrow Funds.

  



  

9.5   _Materiality_. For purposes of this _Article IX_ , the
representations and warranties of the Parties shall not be deemed qualified
by any references to "Material Adverse Effect," "in all material respects," or
any other reference to materiality contained therein (except to the extent
such references qualify what is required to be set forth on _Sections_
_4.4(f)_ , _4.5_ , _4.10(b)(ii)_ , _4.11(d)_ , _4.18(i)_ , and _4.19_ of the

9.6   _Knowledge_. (a) No Party shall be prohibited from
asserting (i) any claim for indemnification under the provisions of _Article
IX_ based on the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, or based on the failure of any representation or warranty to be
true and correct as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date (each, a
"Default") or (ii) any such Default as a justification for claiming in the
case of Purchaser, that a condition to Purchaser's obligation to close under
_Section 8.3_ has not occurred or as a justification for termination of this
Agreement under _Section 10.1(e)_ , or in the case of Seller, that a
condition to Seller's obligation to close under _Section 8._ 2 or as a
justification for termination of this Agreement under _Section 10.1(d)_ , and
(b) no Party's rights under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document
shall be diminished or otherwise affected in any way, in each case as result
of the existence of such Party's knowledge of any such Default as of the date
hereof or as of the Closing Date regardless of whether such knowledge exists
as a result of the Party's investigation, as a result of the disclosure by
the other Party (or any other Person), or otherwise.

9.7   _Exclusive Remedy_. Purchaser, on behalf of itself and all
other Purchaser Indemnitees, hereby acknowledges and agrees that, from and
after the Closing, its sole remedy with respect to any and all claims for
money damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement and for the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be pursuant and subject to the
requirements of the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article
IX_. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing contained in this _Article
IX_ shall in any way impair, modify or otherwise limit Purchaser's or
Seller's right to (i) bring any claim, demand or suit against the other party
based upon such other party's fraud or intentional breach of this Agreement,
it being understood that a mere breach of a representation and warranty,
without intentional or willful misrepresentation, does not constitute
fraud, or (ii) seek or obtain specific performance in accordance with
_Section 11.6_ hereof.

breach, provided Purchaser continues to exercise commercially reasonable
efforts to cure such breach (it being understood that Seller may not

_Section 10.1(d)_ if at the time of such termination it shall be in material
breach of this Agreement or if such breach by Purchaser is cured during such
thirty (30) day period; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller's right to
terminate this Agreement under this _clause (d)_ shall not be available if
Seller is then in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or if any representation or warranty of
Seller shall have become untrue such that the conditions set forth in
_Sections 8.3(a)_ or _(b)_ would not be satisfied; or

  



  

(e)  by Purchaser, upon a material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Seller set
forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Seller shall
have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in
_Article VIII_ would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of
the time such representation or warranty shall have become untrue, provided,
that if such breach is curable by Seller prior to the Closing Date, then
Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section 10.1(f)_ until
the earlier of the Termination Date and thirty (30) days after delivery of
written notice from Purchaser to Seller of such breach, provided Seller
continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach (it
being understood that Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement prior to the
Termination Date pursuant to this _Section 10.1(f)_ if at the time of such
termination it shall be in material breach of this Agreement or if such
breach by Seller is cured during such thirty (30) day period); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Purchaser's right to terminate this Agreement under this
_clause (e)_ shall not be available if Purchaser is then in breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
or if any representation or warranty of Purchaser shall have become untrue
such that the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.2(a)_ or _(b)_ would not be
satisfied.

  



  

10.2   _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_.

  



  

(a)  Any termination of this Agreement under _Section 10.1_
above will be effective immediately upon (or, if the termination is prior to

the first proviso therein is applicable, thirty (30) days after) the delivery
of written notice of the terminating party to the other Parties hereto.

11.2   _Interpretation_. The definitions of the terms herein shall
apply equally to the singular and plural forms of the terms defined. Whenever
the context shall require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding
masculine, feminine and neuter forms. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to an Exhibit or Disclosure Letter, such reference shall be to an
Exhibit or Disclosure Letter to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections or subsections,
such reference shall be to a Section or subsection of this Agreement. Unless
otherwise indicated the words "include," "includes" and "including" when used
herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement. When reference is made herein to "the
business of" an entity, such reference shall be deemed to include the
business of all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such entity. Reference to

11.3   _Counterparts; Facsimile or Electronic Signatures_. This
Agreement and each other document executed in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and the consummation thereof, may be
executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one
and the same document and shall become effective when one or more counterparts
have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Party, it
being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Delivery
by facsimile or electronic signature to counsel for the other Party of a
counterpart executed by a Party shall be deemed to meet the requirements of
the previous sentence.

  



  

11.4   _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the Parties
hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Exhibits and
Disclosure Letters hereto (a) constitute the entire agreement among the

provided in this Agreement, including with respect to the DandO Indemnitees,

11.5   _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties hereto; _provided_ that the
Parties intend that the remedies and limitations thereof contained in
_Article IX_ be construed as an integral provision of this Agreement and that
such remedies and limitations shall not be severable in any manner that
increases a Party\'s liability or obligation hereunder. The Parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

  



  

11.6   _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The
Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Parties
shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in
any state and/or federal court located within the State of Delaware having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

  



  

11.7   _Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of
Delaware regardless of the law that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of law thereof. All disputes arising from or relating
to this Agreement shall be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the state
and/or federal courts located within the State of Delaware, and each Party
hereby consents to such exclusive jurisdiction and waives objections to venue
therein and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any
action or proceeding in any such court.

  



  

11.8   _Waiver of Jury Trial_. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH
HEREBY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I) ARISING UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT OR (II) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE
DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER
ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. EACH OF THE
PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH
CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL
WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN
ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY.

11.9   _Rules of Construction_. The Parties hereto agree that they
have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or

document.

  



  

11.10   _Assignment_. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of the other Parties (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser may assign
its rights under this Agreement to a wholly owned subsidiary formed for such
purpose if such assignment does not require any new consents or approvals and
such assignment shall not relieve Purchaser of its obligations hereunder. In
the event of such an assignment, the term "Purchaser" shall be deemed to
include such subsidiary for all purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing
restriction, Purchaser may assign its rights hereunder to its lenders for
collateral security purposes. Subject to the first sentence of this _Section
11.10_ , this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

  



  

11.11   _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties hereto
at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each
of the Parties.

  



  

11.12   _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, any party
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed; (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties
hereto; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made
to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the
benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. No failure or delay in
exercising any right under this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of such
right, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege.

  



  

11.13   _Currency_. All references to currency amounts in this Agreement
shall mean United States dollars.

  



  

11.14   _Certain Matters Regarding Representation of the Seller and the
Company_.

  



  

(a)   _Dentons_. Dentons US LLP ("Dentons") has acted as
counsel for Spire, the Seller, the Company and their Affiliates in connection
with this Agreement and in connection with the related sale process involving
the Company (the "Acquisition Engagement") and in that connection not as
counsel for any other Person, including without limitation, Purchaser.
Dentons has also represented such parties prior to the Closing in respect of
other matters and will continue to represent Spire, the Seller and their
respective Affiliates following the Closing.

  



  

   

79 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b)   _Acquisition Engagement_. Only Spire, the Seller, their
respective Affiliates, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be considered
clients of Dentons in the Acquisition Engagement. Communications of or seeking
legal advice between any one or more of Spire, Seller, any Affiliates of
either thereof, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand and
Dentons on the other, shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that
belong solely to Spire and Seller and not the Company or its Subsidiaries to
the extent such communications (or the specific portion thereof) relate to the
Acquisition Engagement (collectively, the "Acquisition Engagement
Communications"). Accordingly, Purchaser shall not have access to the
Acquisition Engagement Communications, or to any Acquisition Engagement
Communications in the files of Dentons, whether or not the Closing shall have
occurred. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the
Closing: (i) Spire and the Seller shall be the sole holders of the attorney-
client privilege with respect to the Acquisition Engagement Communications,
and none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor Purchaser shall be a
holder thereof; (ii) to the extent that any Acquisition Engagement
Communications in the files of Dentons constitute property of the client,
only Spire and Seller shall hold such property rights; and (iii)
Dentons shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such
Acquisition Engagement Communications to the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or Purchaser by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between Dentons and the Company and its Subsidiaries or otherwise
unless otherwise directed by a court order or the order of any Governmental
Authority.

  



  

(c)   _Post-Closing Representation of Seller, Including Matters
Relating to the Acquisition_. If Spire, Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates so desire, and without the need for any consent or waiver by the
Company, its Subsidiaries or Purchaser or any Affiliate of any thereof,
Dentons shall be permitted to act as counsel to any of Spire, Seller and/or
any of their respective Affiliates after the Closing in connection with any
matter, including without limitation anything related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any disagreement or dispute
relating thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the
Closing, Dentons shall be permitted to represent Spire, the Seller and any of
their respective agents or Affiliates, or any one or more of them, in
connection with any negotiation, transaction or dispute ("dispute" includes
litigation, arbitration or other adversary proceeding) with Purchaser or any
of its agents or Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) under or relating to this Agreement or any transaction or
matter expressly contemplated by this Agreement, such as claims for
indemnification.

  



  

(d)   _Cessation of Attorney-Client Relationship With Company_.
Upon and after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall cease to
have any attorney-client relationship with Dentons, including with respect to
any matter arising after the Closing, unless Dentons is specifically engaged
in writing by the Company to represent the Company after Closing. For the
avoidance of doubt, on and after the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall (i) continue to hold the attorney-client privilege with
respect to (A) all matters in which Dentons has acted as counsel for the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the Acquisition Engagement,
and (B) all communications between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and Dentons, on the other hand, except for the Acquisition
Engagement Communications; and (ii) to the extent that any communications
(other than the Acquisition Engagement Communications) are in the files of
Dentons and constitute property of the client, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall continue to hold such property rights.

  



  

(e)   _Consent and Waiver of Conflicts of Interest_. The
Seller, the Company (on its own behalf and on behalf of its Subsidiaries) and
Purchaser consent to the foregoing arrangements.

Escrow Agent shall neither be responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge
of, nor have any requirements to comply with, the terms and conditions of any
other agreement, instrument or document between the parties, in connection
with, if any, including without limitation the Purchase Agreement (the
"Underlying Agreements"), nor shall Escrow Agent be required to determine if
any person or entity has complied with any Underlying Agreement, nor shall
any additional obligations of Escrow Agent be inferred from the terms of any
Underlying Agreements, even though reference thereto may be made in this
Agreement.

  



  

(c)   _Compensation_ ; _Acknowledgment_. Escrow Agent shall be

Agent. If any amount is withdrawn from the Escrow Amount to compensate or
reimburse the Escrow Agent under this Section 3(c), Seller and Purchaser shall
each immediately replenish an amount equal to 50% of the amount withdrawn, to

of such Escrow Agent compensation or reimbursement to the Escrow Agent. In
addition, if any amount paid by Seller or Purchaser on account of the fees or
Other Expenses pursuant to this Section 3(c) is in excess of one-half thereof,
the party that paid such excess amount shall be entitled to reimbursement of
such amount (plus all reasonable and documented attorneys' fees and expenses
incurred in connection with enforcing this provision, if any) from the other.

(d)   _Resignation of Escrow Agent_. Escrow Agent may, at any
time, resign by giving thirty (30) days advance notice in writing of such
resignation (a "Notice of Resignation") to Purchaser and Seller, specifying a
date when such resignation shall take effect. If a successor Escrow Agent
shall not have been appointed within thirty (30) days after the giving of the
Notice of Resignation, or joint written instructions from Purchaser and Seller
provided to the Escrow Agent to deliver the Escrow Amount to another person
as provided below, or if such delivery is contrary to applicable law, at any
time on or after the effective resignation date, Escrow Agent either (i) may
appoint a successor Escrow Agent of its own choice; or (ii) interplead the
Escrow Amount with a court located in the State of New York and the costs,
expenses and reasonable attorney's fees which are incurred in connection with
such proceeding may be charged against and withdrawn from the Escrow Amount.
Any appointment of a successor Escrow Agent shall be binding upon Purchaser
and Seller and no appointed successor Escrow Agent shall be an agent of
Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent's sole responsibility after such thirty (30) day
notice period expires shall be to hold the Escrow Amount (without any
obligation to reinvest the same) and to deliver the same to any appointed
successor Escrow Agent designated by Purchaser and Seller, or such other
person designated by Purchaser and Seller, or in accordance with the
directions of a final court order, at which time of delivery Escrow Agent's
obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate, subject to the provisions of
Section 3(g).

  



  

(e)   _Removal of Escrow Agent_. By mutual agreement, Purchaser
and Seller shall have the right at any time, upon not less than ten (10)
days' prior written notice to Escrow Agent, to terminate their appointment of
Escrow Agent as Escrow Agent, or any successor Escrow Agent, as Escrow Agent
hereunder; provided that, a successor has been appointed and qualified to act
as Escrow Agent.

  



  

(f)   _Liability of Escrow Agent_. Escrow Agent undertakes to
perform such duties as are expressly set forth in this Agreement. Escrow
Agent shall have no liability except as expressly set forth herein or in
connection with the performance of such duties as are expressly set forth
herein and except to the extent that a final adjudication of a court of
competent jurisdiction determines that Escrow Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct was the cause of any direct loss to Purchaser or Seller.
Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel, accountants and other skilled
persons to be selected and retained by it (which counsel, accountant or
skilled person shall be of Escrow Agent's own choosing, but may not be
providing services to Purchaser or Seller) regarding any of its duties or
obligations hereunder and shall have no liability with respect to any
action taken by it in accordance with advice received from such counsel,
accountants or skilled persons. Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any
other act or failure to act under or in connection with this Agreement, except
that notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Escrow Agent
shall be liable for its own gross negligence, willful misconduct and bad
faith. Escrow Agent's duties hereunder shall be determined only by reference
to this Agreement and applicable laws, and Escrow Agent shall not be
charged with any duties or responsibilities pursuant to any other document or
agreement. In the event that any conflict between the terms and provisions of
this Agreement and those of the Purchase Agreement, any schedule or exhibit
attached to this Agreement or any other agreement between Purchaser and
Seller, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control with respect
to the duties and obligations of Escrow Agent hereunder. Anything in this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Escrow Agent
be liable for special, incidental, punitive, indirect or consequential loss or
damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits),
even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or
damage and regardless of the form of action.

(g)   _Indemnification of Escrow Agent_. Purchaser and Seller
shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless Escrow Agent

demands, judgments, losses, damages, liabilities, penalties, settlements
actions, suits, proceedings, litigation, investigations, costs or expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable and documented fees and expenses of
outside legal counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of
document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively "Losses") arising
out of or in connection with (i) Escrow Agent's execution and performance of
this Agreement, the enforcement of any rights or remedies under or in
connection with this Agreement, except to the extent such Losses are finally
adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been primarily
caused by the gross negligence, willful misconduct, or bad faith of Escrow
Agent, and (ii) its following, accepting or acting upon any instructions or
other directions from Purchaser and Seller received in accordance with the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, except to the extent such Losses
result from a breach by Escrow Agent of this Agreement. The parties hereto
acknowledge that the foregoing indemnities shall survive the resignation,
replacement or the removal of Escrow Agent or the termination of this
Agreement. Purchaser and Seller hereby grant Escrow Agent a lien on, right of
set-off against and security interest in, the Escrow Amount for the payment
of any claim for indemnification, expenses and amounts due hereunder. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Escrow Agent is expressly authorized and
directed, but shall not be obligated, to charge against and withdraw from the
Escrow Amount for its own account or for the account of an Indemnitee any
amounts due to Escrow Agent or to an Indemnitee under this Section 3(g). If
any amount is withdrawn from the Escrow Amount to indemnify the Escrow Agent
or an Indemnitee for Losses under this Section 3(g), Seller and Purchaser
shall each immediately replenish an amount equal to 50% of the amount
withdrawn, to the extent Seller or Purchaser, respectively, has not already
paid its portion of such Losses to the Escrow Agent or the Indemnitee. In
addition, as between the Parties, if any amount paid by Seller or Purchaser on
account of indemnification obligations owed pursuant to this Section 3(g) is
in excess of one-half thereof, the Party that paid such excess amount shall
be entitled to reimbursement of such amount (plus all reasonable and
documented attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in connection with enforcing
this provision, if any) from the other Party. The obligations contained in
this Section 3(g) shall survive the termination of the Agreement and the
resignation, replacement or removal of Escrow Agent.

  



  

(h)   _Reliance on Documentary Evidence_. (i) Any instructions
setting forth, claiming, containing, objecting to or in any way related to
the transfer or distribution of the Escrow Amount, must be in writing,
executed by an Authorized Person, as hereinafter defined, of one or both of
Seller and Purchaser as required by the applicable provision of this
Agreement, and delivered to Escrow Agent only by confirmed facsimile or as a
Portable Document Format ("PDF"), attached to an email on a Business Day only
at the fax number or email address set forth in Section 9 below. Attached
hereto as _Schedule 2-A_ and _Schedule 2-B_ are the names, titles and
specimen signatures of each of the persons (each, an "Authorized Person")
authorized, on behalf of Purchaser or Seller as the case may be, to execute
and deliver written notices and directions to Escrow Agent hereunder. Each
Schedule 2 shall be signed by any Manager or any Secretary, any Assistant
Secretary or other duly authorized officer of Purchaser and Seller.

(ii)  Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any written
notice, certificate, affidavit, letter, document or other communication that
is reasonably believed by Escrow Agent in good faith to be genuine and to have
been signed by an Authorized Person of the proper party or parties, without
further inquiry or investigation. Any notice, document, instruction or request
delivered by Purchaser or Seller, but not required under this Agreement, may
be disregarded by Escrow Agent and may be returned to the sending party.

  



  

(iii)  Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit any payments
which may be due it or the Escrow Accounts. In the event that Escrow Agent
shall be uncertain, or believes there is some ambiguity, as to its duties or
rights hereunder or receives instructions, claims or demands from any party
hereto which in Escrow Agent's judgment conflict with any of the provisions of
this Agreement, or if Escrow Agent receives conflicting instructions from the
parties, Escrow Agent shall, promptly notify Seller and Purchaser and (A)
refrain from taking any action until it shall be given (1) a joint written
direction executed by Authorized Persons of both Purchaser and Seller which
eliminates such conflict or (2) a court order issued by a court of competent
jurisdiction (it being understood that Escrow Agent shall be entitled
conclusively to rely and act upon any such court order and shall have no
obligation to determine whether any such court order is final); or (B) file
an action in interpleader.

  



  

(i)   _Interpleader_. (i) In addition to its rights set forth
in clause (iii) of Section 3(h), if Purchaser and Seller disagree about the
interpretation of this Agreement, or about the rights and obligations or the
propriety of any act contemplated by Escrow Agent hereunder, then Escrow
Agent may, in its reasonable discretion, file an action of interpleader in
the appropriate court of competent jurisdiction and deposit all of the Escrow
Amount with such court and the costs, expenses and reasonable attorney's fees
which are incurred with such proceeding may be charged against and withdrawn
from the Escrow Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such action of
interpleader shall not be deemed to modify the manner in which Escrow Agent
is entitled to make disbursements of the Escrow Amount as set forth in this
Agreement other than to tender the Escrow Amount into the registry of such
court. If any amount is withdrawn from the Escrow Amount to cover such costs
of interpleader under this Section 3(i), Seller and Purchaser shall each
immediately replenish an amount equal to 50% of the amount withdrawn, to
the extent Seller or Purchaser, respectively, has not already paid its
portion of such amounts.

  



  

(ii)  If, at any time, Escrow Agent receives a copy of the
final, nonappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction from the
prevailing party, certified by counsel that such order is final and
nonappealable, along with written instructions from an Authorized Person of
the instructing party to effectuate such order or joint written instructions
signed by an Authorized Person of each of Purchaser and Seller, directing
delivery of the Escrow Amount, Escrow Agent shall comply with such order or
instructions. Escrow Agent shall be entitled conclusively to rely upon any
such certification and instruction and shall have no responsibility to review
the order to which such certification and instruction refers or to make any
determination as to whether such order is final.

4.   _Investment_.

The rate of return on an MMDA varies from time to time as determined by Escrow Agent. All investments of the Escrow Amount shall be held by, or registered in the name of, Escrow Agent or its nominee. The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to execute purchases and sales of investments through the facilities of its own trading or capital markets operations or those of any affiliated entity and the Escrow Agent or any affiliated entity may act as counterparty with respect to such investments. Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates may receive compensation with respect to any Alternative Investment directed hereunder including without limitation charging any applicable agency fee or trade execution fee in connection with each transaction. Purchaser and Seller recognize and agree that Escrow Agent will not provide supervision, recommendations or advice relating to either the investment of the Escrow Amount or the purchase, sale, retention or other disposition of any investment described herein and has made an independent assessment of the suitability for its own purposes of any of any investment hereunder. Market values, exchange rates and other valuation information (including without limitation, market value, current value or notional value) of any Alternative Investment furnished in any report or statement may be obtained from third party sources and is furnished for the exclusive use of the Parties. Escrow Agent has no responsibility whatsoever to determine the market or other value of any Alternative Investment and makes no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy of any such valuations or that any values necessarily reflect the proceeds that may be received on the sale of an Alternative Investment. The Escrow Agent shall not have any liability for any loss sustained as a result of any investment made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, any liquidation of any investment prior to its maturity, or the failure of the Authorized Persons of both Purchaser and Seller to give Escrow Agent instructions to invest or reinvest the Escrow Amount. The Escrow Agent shall have the right to liquidate any investments held in order to provide funds necessary to make required payments under this Agreement.

  



  

5.   _Distributions_. Escrow Agent shall distribute the Escrow Amount in accordance with the following provisions:

delivers to Escrow Agent and Seller a certificate in substantially the form
of _Exhibit A_ attached hereto in which Purchaser claims indemnification or
an amount otherwise due to it from the Indemnity Amount pursuant to the terms
of the Purchase Agreement (any such claim, a "Pending Claim"), then Escrow
Agent shall promptly pay to Purchaser out of the Indemnity Account the amount
of the Indemnity Amount set forth in such certificate in accordance with such
certificate on the first Business Day after the tenth (10th) calendar day
following the date such certificate is received by Escrow Agent; provided,
however, that no such payment shall be made if Escrow Agent receives from
Seller prior to 5:00 p.m. New York Time on the tenth (10th) calendar day
following the date such certificate is received by Escrow Agent, a
certificate in substantially the form of _Exhibit B_ attached hereto, pursuant
to which Seller objects to such claim (an "Objection Notice"). If Escrow
Agent and Purchaser receive an Objection Notice from Seller within such ten
(10) calendar day period, then Escrow Agent shall (x) disburse from the
Indemnity Account to Purchaser the Agreed Portion of the Indemnity Amount
identified in such Objection Notice, if any, and (y) hold in the Indemnity
Account the Disputed Portion of the Indemnity Amount identified in such
Objection Notice, until receipt of (A) notice of a judgment in

to Escrow Agent a written certificate in substantially the form of _Exhibit
C_ attached hereto, instructing Escrow Agent to deliver to Purchaser or
Seller, as applicable, a portion of the Indemnity Amount from the Indemnity
Account, in the amount of such judgment. Such certificate shall state the

accompanied by a true, correct and complete copy of the order or
other evidence of judgment and accompanied by a written certification from
counsel for the instructing party attesting that such judgment is final and
not subject to further proceedings or appeal. Escrow Agent shall deliver from
the Indemnity Account the lesser of (x) the stated amount of the Indemnity
Amount to Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, on the tenth (10th) day after
it receives such certificate and (y) the total amount of the Indemnity
Amount. Unless Escrow Agent is otherwise jointly instructed in writing by
Purchaser and Seller, any amounts disbursed by Escrow Agent hereunder to
Seller shall be disbursed: (i) ____% to Seller and (ii) ____% (representing

equal to (x) the balance of the Indemnity Amount from the Indemnity Account
together with interest accrued thereon held by Escrow Agent on such date,
_less_ (y) the total amount of any Pending Claims on such date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the sum described in the foregoing clause (y) exceeds the
balance of the Indemnity Escrow Amount in the Indemnity Account prior to such
release, no such release shall be made. Unless Escrow Agent is otherwise
jointly instructed in writing by Purchaser and Seller, any amounts disbursed
by Escrow Agent hereunder to Seller shall be disbursed from the Indemnity

Option Allocation Schedule (defined in the Purchase Agreement), less any
applicable withholding amounts required by law.

(b)   _Distribution of Working Capital Amount to Seller_. (i) No
later than the third (3rd) Business Day (such date, the "Working Capital
Release Date") following the determination of the Final Payment Adjustment
Amount (or, if the Final Payment Adjustment Amount is the subject of a
Disputed Matter, the undisputed portion thereof) under the Purchase
Agreement, Purchaser and Seller shall deliver a joint notification in
substantially the form of _Exhibit D_  attached hereto to Escrow Agent
directing Escrow Agent to release from the Working Capital Account and deliver
to Seller and/or Purchaser the Working Capital Amount and all Escrow Interest
accrued thereon (which portion payable to Purchaser shall include a portion
of the Escrow Interest payable, but not previously distributed, in accordance
with Sections 5(d) and 8). As between the Parties, if any portion of the
Final Payment Adjustment Amount is the subject of the Disputed Matter, then

Final Payment Adjustment Amount), if joint notification is not delivered
during such time period prior to the Auditor Determination, then either
Purchaser or Seller shall be entitled to deliver to Escrow Agent a written
certificate in substantially the form of _Exhibit C_ attached hereto,
instructing Escrow Agent to deliver to Purchaser or Seller, as applicable,
from the Working Capital Account the amount provided in such Auditor
Determination, up to the Working Capital Amount plus the Escrow Interest

(or, a true, correct and complete copy of the order of a court of competent
jurisdiction accompanied by a written certification from counsel for the
instructing party that such judgment is final and not subject to further
proceedings or appeal). Escrow Agent shall be entitled conclusively to rely
upon any such instruction and shall have no responsibility to review the
Auditor Determination (or final order of a court of competent jurisdiction)
to which such instruction refers or to make any determination as to whether
such determination is final. Escrow Agent agrees to release any such amount
from the Working Capital Account on the first Business Day following its
receipt of either of such notifications. Unless Escrow Agent is otherwise
jointly instructed in writing by Purchaser and Seller, any amounts disbursed
by Escrow Agent hereunder to Seller shall be disbursed from the
Working Capital Account: (i) ____% to Seller and (ii) ____% (representing the
Aggregate Option Holder Pro Rata Share) to the Company for the benefit of and
further distribution to the Option Holders of the Seller in accordance with
the Option Allocation Schedule, less any applicable withholding amounts

the transfer or distribution of the Escrow Amount shall be deemed delivered
and effective unless Escrow Agent actually shall have received such
instruction only at the facsimile or email address provided to the parties by
Escrow Agent in accordance with Section 9 and as further evidenced by a
confirmed transmittal to that email address and Escrow Agent has been able to
satisfy any applicable security procedures as may be required hereunder.
Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any party or other person for refraining
from acting upon any instruction for or related to the transfer or
distribution of the Escrow Amount if delivered to any other email address,
including but not limited to a valid email address of any employee of Escrow
Agent.

  



  

(f)   _Confirmation by Escrow Agent_. In the event fund
transfer instructions are received by Escrow Agent by facsimile or a PDF
attached to an email, Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such
instructions by telephone call-back to the Authorized Persons on _Schedules
2A_ or _2B_ and, so long as Escrow Agent is acting reasonably and in good
faith, Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be
an Authorized Person. The information in _Schedules 2A_ and _2B_ may be
changed only in writing by an Authorized Person of Seller or an Authorized
Person of Purchaser, or other duly authorized officer of the applicable
party, as the case may be, actually received by Escrow Agent via facsimile or
PDF attached to an email. Except as set forth in Section 5(g), Section 5(h)
and Section 5(i) below, no funds will be disbursed until an Authorized Person
is able to confirm such instructions by telephone callback. Escrow Agent, any
intermediary bank and the beneficiary's bank in any funds transfer may rely
upon the identifying number of the beneficiary's bank or any intermediary
bank included in a funds transfer instruction provided by Purchaser or Seller
and confirmed by an Authorized Person. Further the beneficiary's bank in the
funds transfer instruction may make payment on the basis of the account
number provided in such party's or the parties' instruction and confirmed by

(c)   _Law and Forum_. (i) This Agreement shall be construed
and interpreted according to the internal laws of the State of New York,

hereby shall be brought in the United States District Court sitting in the
Borough of Manhattan in New York, New York (or, if jurisdiction is there
lacking, in a state court of cognizant jurisdiction in the Borough of
Manhattan in New York, New York). To the extent that in any jurisdiction
either party may now or hereafter be entitled to claim itself or its assets,
immunity from suit, execution attachment (before or after judgment), or other
legal process, such party shall not claim, and it hereby irrevocable waives,
such immunity. Each of Purchaser, Seller and Escrow Agent hereby consents to
the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate court
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, actions or proceeding
which is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on a party
hereto anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of
any such court. Each of Purchaser and Seller. severally and not jointly,
represent, warrant and covenant that (i) each document, notice,
instruction or request provided by such party to Escrow Agent shall comply
with applicable laws and regulations, (ii) such party has full power and
authority to enter into, execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform all
of the duties and obligations to be performed by it hereunder; and (iii) the
person(s) executing this Agreement on such party's behalf and certifying
Authorized Persons in the applicable _Schedule 2_ have been duly and properly
authorized to do so, and each Authorized Person of such party has been duly
and properly authorized to take the actions specified for such person in the
applicable _Schedule 2_. Except as expressly provided in Section 3(g),
nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be construed to
give to any person or entity other than Escrow Agent and the parties any
legal or equitable right, remedy, interest or claim under or in respect
of the Escrow Amount or this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is
understood and agreed that any disputes between Purchaser and Seller relating
to the merits of any claim for disbursement of amounts from the Escrow Amount
shall be resolved only in accordance with and pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement.

  



  

(i)  The parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive any
right to trial by jury with respect to any suit, action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(d)   _Amendment and Modification_. Except as expressly provided
in Section 5(i) hereof, this Agreement may be amended or modified only by a
written instrument signed by Purchaser, Seller and Escrow Agent.

  



  

(e)   _Waiver_. No waiver by any party of any of the provisions
hereof shall be effective unless expressly set forth in writing and executed
by the party so waiving. The waiver by any party of a breach of any provision
of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach.

  



  

(f)   _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the
exhibits and schedules attached hereto), together with the Purchase
Agreement, supersedes all prior agreements among the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and constitutes a complete and exclusive
statement of the terms of the agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement. There have been and are no agreements,
representations or warranties among the parties other than those set forth or
provided for in this Agreement, and the Purchase Agreement, and the other
agreements and documents contemplated thereby. This Agreement is not intended
to expand, limit or otherwise modify any of the right and obligations of
Purchaser and Seller under the Purchase Agreement, and shall not be construed
to have any such effect.

(g)   _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof to any Person or circumstance shall be determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining
provisions hereof, or the application thereof to Persons or circumstances
other than those to which it is held invalid or unenforceable, shall not be
affected thereby and shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law.

  



  

(h)   _Headings_. The headings of the sections and subsections
of this Agreement are for ease of reference only and do not evidence the
intentions of the parties.

  



  

(i)   _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any joint instruction
may be executed by facsimile signature pages or PDF attached to an email and
in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but
all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  



  

(j)   _Force Majeure_. In the event that Escrow Agent is
unable to perform its obligations under the terms of this Agreement because
of acts of God, strikes, electrical outages, equipment or transmission failure
or damage reasonably beyond its control, or other cause reasonably beyond its
control, Escrow Agent shall not be liable for damages to Purchaser or Seller
for any damages resulting from such failure to perform. Performance by Escrow
Agent under this Agreement shall resume when Escrow Agent is able to
substantially perform its obligations hereunder.

  



  

(k)   _Successor Escrow Agent_. Any corporation into which
Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be merged or converted or with
which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which Escrow Agent in its individual capacity
shall be a party, or any corporation to which substantially all the escrow
business of Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be transferred, shall
be Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act.

  



  

(l)   _Compliance with Court Orders_. In the event that a
legal garnishment, attachment, levy restraining notice or court order is
served with respect to any of the Escrow Amount, or the delivery thereof shall
be stayed or enjoined by an order of a court, or any order, judgment or
decree shall be entered or issued by any court affecting the
property deposited in the Escrow Accounts under this Agreement, Escrow Agent
is hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply
with any such orders, judgment or decree, which Escrow Agent is advised by
legal counsel of its own choosing (but such counsel may not be counsel to
Purchaser or Seller) is binding upon it, whether with or without jurisdiction,
and in the event that Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such judgment,
order or decree, it shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to
any other person, entity, firm or corporation, by reason of such compliance
even if such judgment, order or decree is subsequently reversed, modified,
annulled, set aside or vacated.

  



  

(m) _Information_. Purchaser and Seller authorize the Escrow
Agent to disclose information with respect to this Agreement and the
account(s) established hereunder, the parties, or any transaction hereunder
if such disclosure is: (i) to a proposed assignee of the rights of Escrow
Agent; (ii) to a branch, affiliate, subsidiary, employee or agent of the
Escrow Agent or to their auditors, regulators or legal advisers or to any
competent court; (iii) upon the written request of Purchaser or Seller, to the
auditors of any of the Purchaser and Seller; or (iv) required by applicable
law.

SCHEDULE 1

  



  

FEE SCHEDULE

  



  

As the sole consideration for Escrow Agent's performance of this Agreement,
Escrow Agent shall receive an annual administrative fee of $2,500, without
pro-ration for partial years, the first payment of which shall be made upon
execution of the Escrow Agreement. Such fees shall be paid in accordance
with Section 3(c) hereof.

  



  

Extraordinary Services and Out-of Pocket Expenses

  

Any additional services beyond our standard services as specified above, and
all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses including attorney's or accountant's
fees and expenses will be considered extraordinary services for which related
costs, transaction charges, and additional fees will be billed at the Escrow
Agent's then standard rate. Disbursements, receipts, investments or tax
reporting exceeding 25 items per year may be treated as extraordinary
services thereby incurring additional charges. The Escrow Agent may impose,
charge, pass-through and modify fees and/or charges for any account
established and services provided by Escrow Agent, including but not limited
to, transaction, maintenance, balance-deficiency, and service fees and other
charges, agency or trade execution fees, including those levied by any
governmental authority.

  



  

Fee Disclosure and Assumptions

  

Please note that the fees quoted are based on a review of the transaction
documents provided and an internal due diligence review. JPMorgan reserves the
right to revise, modify, change and supplement the fees quoted herein if the
assumptions underlying the activity in the account, level of balances, market
volatility or conditions or other factors change from those used to set our
fees.

  



  

The escrow deposit shall be continuously invested in a JPMorgan Chase Bank
money market deposit account ("MMDA"). MMDA have rates of compensation
that may vary from time to time as determined by Escrow Agent.

  



  

Disclosures and Agreements

  



  

For purposes of these Disclosures and Agreements, any reference to "you"
shall mean each of Purchaser and Seller.

  



  

Representations Relating to Section 15B of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (Rule 15Ba1-1 et seq.) (the "Municipal Advisor Rule). Purchaser
represents and warrants to the Escrow Agent that for purposes of the
Municipal Advisor Rules, none of the funds (if any) currently invested, or
that will be invested in the future, in money market funds, commercial paper
or treasury bills under this Agreement constitute or contain (i) proceeds of
municipal securities (including investment income therefrom and monies pledged
or otherwise legally dedicated to serve as collateral or a source or
repayment for such securities) or (ii) municipal escrow investments (as each
such term is defined in the Municipal Advisor Rule). Purchaser also
represents and warrants to the Escrow Agent that the person providing this
certification has access to the appropriate information or has direct
knowledge of the source of the funds to be invested to enable the forgoing
representation to be made. Further, Purchaser acknowledges that the Escrow
Agent will rely on this representation until notified in writing otherwise.

  



  

   

 | \- 16 -| Escrow Agreement 
---|---|--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Patriot Act Disclosure. Section 326 of the Uniting and Strengthening America
by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism
Act of 2001 ("USA PATRIOT Act") requires Escrow Agent to implement reasonable
procedures to verify the identity of any person that opens a new account with
it. Accordingly, you acknowledge that Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and
Escrow Agent's identity verification procedures require Escrow Agent to
obtain information which may be used to confirm your identity
including without limitation name, address and organizational documents
("identifying information"). You agree to provide Escrow Agent with and
consent to Escrow Agent obtaining from third parties any such identifying
information required as a condition of opening an account with or using any
service provided by Escrow Agent.

  



  

OFAC Disclosure. Escrow Agent is required to act in accordance with the laws
and regulations of various jurisdictions relating to the prevention of money
laundering and the implementation of sanctions, including but not limited to
regulations issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Escrow Agent
is not obligated to execute payment orders or effect any other transaction
where the beneficiary or other payee is a person or entity with whom Escrow
Agent is prohibited from doing business by any law or regulation applicable to
Escrow Agent, or in any case where compliance would, in Escrow Agent's
opinion, conflict with applicable law or banking practice or its own policies
and procedures. Where Escrow Agent does not execute a payment order or effect
a transaction for such reasons, Escrow Agent may take any action required by
any law or regulation applicable to Escrow Agent including, without
limitation, freezing or blocking funds. Transaction screening may result in
delays in the posting of transactions.

  



  

Abandoned Property. Escrow Agent is required to act in accordance with the
laws and regulations of various states relating to abandoned property and,
accordingly, shall be entitled to remit dormant funds to any state as
abandoned property in accordance with such laws and regulations.

  



  

THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURES ARE REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED UNDER APPLICABLE U.S.
REGULATIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATION D.
WHERE SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS ARE NOTED BELOW, THE DISCLOSURES APPLY ONLY TO
THOSE INVESTMENTS AND NOT TO ANY OTHER INVESTMENT.

  



  

Demand Deposit Account Disclosure. Escrow Agent is authorized, for regulatory
reporting and internal accounting purposes, to divide an escrow demand deposit
account maintained in the U.S. in which the Escrow Funds are held into a non-
interest bearing demand deposit internal account and a non-interest bearing
savings internal account, and to transfer funds on a daily basis between these
internal accounts on Escrow Agent's general ledger in accordance with U.S.
law at no cost to the parties. Escrow Agent will record the internal accounts
and any transfers between them on Escrow Agent's books and records only. The
internal accounts and any transfers between them will not affect the Escrow
Funds, any investment or disposition of the Escrow Funds, use of the escrow
demand deposit account or any other activities under this Agreement, except
as described herein. Escrow Agent will establish a target balance for the
demand deposit internal account, which may change at any time. To the extent
funds in the demand deposit internal account exceed the target balance, the
excess will be transferred to the savings internal account, unless the maximum
number of transfers from the savings internal account for that calendar month
or statement cycle has already occurred. If withdrawals from the demand
deposit internal account exceeds the available balance in the demand deposit
internal account, funds from the savings internal account will be
transferred to the demand deposit internal account up to the entire balance
of available funds in the savings internal account to cover the shortfall and
to replenish any target balance that Escrow Agent has established for the
demand deposit internal account.  If a sixth transfer is needed during a
calendar month or statement cycle, it will be for the entire balance in the
savings internal account, and such funds will remain in the demand deposit
internal account for the remainder of the calendar month or statement cycle.

---|---|---

MMDA Disclosure and Agreement. If MMDA is the investment for the escrow
deposit as set forth above or anytime in the future, you acknowledge and agree
that U.S. law limits the number of pre-authorized or automatic transfers or
withdrawals or telephonic/electronic instructions that can be made from an
MMDA to a total of six (6) per calendar month or statement cycle or similar
period. Escrow Agent is required by U.S. law to reserve the right to require
at least seven (7) days' notice prior to a withdrawal from a money market
deposit account.

  



  

Unlawful Internet Gambling. The use of any account to conduct transactions
(including, without limitation, the acceptance or receipt of funds through an
electronic funds transfer, or by check, draft or similar instrument, or the
proceeds of any of the foregoing) that are related, directly or indirectly, to
unlawful Internet gambling is strictly prohibited.
