ARTICLE III 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Acquisition Sub or
the holders of any securities of the Company or Acquisition Sub:

 



21 (a) _Cancellation of Company Securities_. Each share of Company Common Stock
held by the Company as treasury stock or held by Buyer or Acquisition Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled,
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be
delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof.

(b) _Conversion of Company Securities_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares cancelled pursuant
to _Section 3.1(a)_ hereof and the Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Each share of Company Common
Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in this _Section 3.1(b)_ shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holders thereof, be automatically cancelled and
shall cease to exist and the holders of certificates (the " _Certificates_ ")
or book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock other than
the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof and in compliance with  _Section 3.3_) or Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with _Section 3.2_ of this Agreement, the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon.

(c) _Conversion of Acquisition Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
each share of common stock, par value of $0.01 per share, of Acquisition Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one (1) fully paid share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement,
if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), or combination, subdivision,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock
distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration
shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Buyer shall designate a paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ")
reasonably acceptable to the Company for the payment of the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(b)_. At or immediately following
the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent, for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
cash constituting an amount equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration (the "
_Aggregate Merger Consideration_ ," and such Aggregate Merger Consideration
as deposited with the Paying Agent, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by
_Section 3.1(b)_, Buyer shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited,
additional funds with the

 



22  Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
required to make such payment. The Paying Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund
to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock and
(ii) applied promptly to making the payments pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_
hereof. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not
expressly provided for in this Agreement. 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (x) a letter of
transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof and in compliance with _Section 3.3_) or Book-Entry Shares to
the Paying Agent and which shall be in the form and have such other provisions
as Buyer and the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify and (y)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the number of
shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement
(which instructions shall provide that at the election of the surrendering
holder, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares may be surrendered, and the Merger
Consideration in exchange therefor collected, by hand delivery). Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_, each Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon surrender the applicable portion of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this _Section
3.2_, without interest thereon.

(c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and
in compliance with _Section 3.3_) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be promptly
mailed following the later to occur of (x) the Effective Time or (y) the
Paying Agents receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof and in compliance with _Section 3.3_) or Book-Entry Share, and the
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and in compliance with
_Section 3.3_) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith
cancelled. If the payment of the applicable portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration is made to a person other than the person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that
(A) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (B) the person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the applicable portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration to a
person other than the registered holder of such Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. The
Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the

 



23  Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holders of shares of Company
Common Stock prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation, as
general creditors thereof for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration,
without interest, to which such holders may be entitled.

 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Buyer, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash held in the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to one (1) year
after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
any cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise
escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Authority), any such
cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall, if directed by
Buyer or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as so directed; _provided_ that (i) no such
investment shall relieve Buyer or the Paying Agent from making the payments
required by this _Article III_ , and following any losses that result in the
amount of cash in the Exchange Fund to be insufficient to make the remaining
payments contemplated to be paid by the Paying Agent from the Exchange Fund
pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer shall promptly provide additional funds to
the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock in the
amount of such deficiency, and (ii) such investments shall be in (A) short-
term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no
more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States of America and
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, (B)
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investor
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors, respectively or (C) money market funds
substantially all the assets of which are comprised of investments in the
obligations described in clauses (A) and (B). Any interest or income produced
by such investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation.

Section 3.3 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof
is entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

 



24 Section 3.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, to the extent that holders of Company Common Stock are entitled to
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
holder who has properly exercised and perfected his or her demand for
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "),
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but
the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such
consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall have failed to timely
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his or her right to
appraisal under the DGCL, such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and
such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. At the Effective
Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as
provided in this _Section 3.4_. The Company shall give Buyer and Acquisition
Sub prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
shares of Company Common Stock, and Buyer and Acquisition Sub shall have
the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands except as required by applicable Law. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Buyer, make any payment with respect
to any demands for fair value for Dissenting Shares or offer to settle,
settle or negotiate in respect of any such demands.

Section 3.5 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. After the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation
will be closed, and there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation of shares of
Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for transfer following the Effective Time, they shall be
cancelled against delivery of the Merger Consideration, as provided for in
_Section 3.1(c)_ hereof, for each share of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 

Section 3.6 _Withholding_. Each of the Paying Agent, the Company, Buyer and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
payments otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company
Common Stock such amounts as it is respectively required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

compensation, pension benefit, educational assistance and all other employee
benefit plans, agreements, programs, policies, commitments or arrangements,
whether or not subject to ERISA, in each case in which any Company
Employee participates, or has any present or future right to benefits, or to

condition exists that presents a material risk to the Company or any ERISA

has occurred with respect to the operation of each such Benefit Plan
which would result in the loss of such qualification.

(e) There are no Proceedings, other than routine claims for benefits,

payment becoming due to any Company Employee, (ii) increase any benefits
otherwise payable to any Company Employee under any Benefit Plan or (iii)
result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefits to any Company Employee under any such plan, in all such events,
which would otherwise not have been due, increased or accelerated had this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Related Transaction Agreements not
been executed.

in material liability to the Company or the Company Employee. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been required to withhold or pay any
Taxes as a result of a failure to comply with Section 409A of the Code. No
person is entitled to receive any additional payment from the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries as a result of the imposition of a Tax under Section 409A
of the Code.

discussions or negotiations with any person (other than the parties hereto)
with respect to any Competing Proposal (other than as contemplated by the
Related Transactions).

 

(c) Notwithstanding any limitations set forth in this Agreement, if after the
date hereof and prior to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval,
the Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Competing Proposal that
(i) did not result from a violation of _Section 6.6_ and (ii) the Board of
Directors of the Company (upon the recommendation of the Special Committee)
determines in good faith after consultation with the Companys outside legal
and financial advisors that such Competing Proposal constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to result, after the taking of any of the actions
referred to in any of clause (x), (y) or (z) below, in a Superior Proposal or
an Alternate Superior Proposal, then the Company may, at any time prior to the
receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, take the following
actions: (x) furnish non-public information with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to the third party making such Competing Proposal, if, and
only if, such information has been previously or is contemporaneously provided
to Buyer and prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives
from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement with terms no less
favorable in the aggregate to the third party than the Confidentiality
Agreement is to Buyer; (y) engage or participate in discussions or
negotiations with such third party with respect to the Competing Proposal; and
(z) in the case of a Competing Proposal that constitutes or would reasonably
be expected to result in an Alternate Superior Proposal, engage in
discussions or negotiations with CBNA and FFELP Buyer Parent with respect to
the Competing Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Company taking such actions as described
in clauses (x), (y) or (z) above (and in any event within 24 hours), the
Company shall provide written notice to Buyer of such determination as
provided for in clause (ii) above, the identity of the third party making such
Competing Proposal and the terms and conditions of the Competing Proposal.
The Company shall keep Buyer informed on a current basis of the status of any
such discussions or negotiations, including any discussions or negotiations
with CBNA and FFELP Buyer Parent. Buyer shall be permitted to engage in
discussions and negotiations with CBNA and FFELP Buyer Parent in connection
with any Competing Proposal.

(d) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i) change, qualify, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to change,
qualify, withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation (a " _Change of
Recommendation_ "), (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve
or recommend, any Competing Proposal or (iii) exempt any person from any state
takeover law, except as provided or permitted by this _Section 6.6_.

(e) If prior to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, either: 

 



60 (i) the Company receives an unsolicited Superior Proposal or an
unsolicited Alternate Superior Proposal and the Company has complied with its
obligations under this _Section 6.6_, or

(ii) other than in connection with a Competing Proposal, the Board of
Directors of the Company (upon the recommendation of the Special Committee)
determines in good faith, in response to the occurrence of a Company
Intervening Event and after consultation with outside legal and financial
advisors, that the failure of the Board of Directors of the Company to effect
a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of
the Board of Directors of the Company to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law,

then, prior to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Board
of Directors of the Company may effect a Change of Recommendation (a "
_Permitted Change of Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , that with respect to
clause (i), (x) the Company shall have first (A) provided seven (7) Business
Days prior written notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") to Buyer that
it is prepared to effect a Permitted Change of Recommendation in response to a
Superior Proposal or an Alternate Superior Proposal and specifying the
reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal
or Alternate Superior Proposal that are the basis of such proposed Permitted
Change of Recommendation, copies of the agreements proposed to effect such
Superior Proposal or Alternate Superior Proposal as well as all material
correspondence relating to such Superior Proposal or Alternate Superior
Proposal and the identity of the person making such proposed
Superior Proposal or Alternate Superior Proposal (it being understood and
agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any material amendment of
any such Superior Proposal or Alternate Superior Proposal shall require a new
Notice of Superior Proposal and a new seven (7) Business Day period), and (B)
during such seven (7) Business Day period, if requested by Buyer, engaged in
good faith negotiations with Buyer (and the parties to the Related
Transactions, if applicable) to amend this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements, and/or the Related Transaction Agreements in such a manner that
any Competing Proposal which was determined to be a Superior Proposal or an
Alternate Superior Proposal, as the case may be, would no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal or an Alternate Superior Proposal, as the case may be, and
(y) at the end of such seven (7) Business Day period (or at such earlier time
following receipt of a Notice of Superior Proposal that Buyer notifies the
Company that it is not interested in pursuing further negotiations to amend
this Agreement), such Competing Proposal has not been withdrawn and continues
to constitute a Superior Proposal or an Alternate Superior Proposal (taking
into account any changes, which have not been withdrawn, to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Buyer and/or, in the case of a Superior Proposal only,
any changes to the Related Transaction Agreements or the Ancillary Agreements
proposed by the parties thereto following a Notice of Superior Proposal, as a
result of the negotiations required by sub-clause (B) or otherwise) and in the
case of clause (ii), the Company shall have first provided seven (7) Business
Days prior written notice (" _Notice of a Proposed Change of Recommendation_
") to Buyer that it is prepared to effect a Permitted Change of Recommendation
in response to a Company Intervening Event and describing such Company
Intervening Event and during such seven (7) Business Day period, if requested
by Buyer, engaged in, and caused its

 



61  Representatives and Affiliates to have engaged in, good faith negotiations
with Buyer and its Representatives (and the parties to the Related Transaction
Agreements and their Representatives) to amend this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements and/or the Related Transaction Agreements and at the end of such
seven (7) Business Day period, the Board of Directors of the Company (upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee) after taking into account all
changes, which have not been withdrawn, to the terms of this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements and/or the Related Transaction Agreements proposed by
Buyer or the parties thereto following such Notice of a Proposed Change
of Recommendation, again determines in good faith that the failure to effect
a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of
the Board of Directors of the Company to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law. 

(f) The Company shall advise Buyer promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
of (i) any Competing Proposal or indication, inquiry, proposal or offer with
respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Competing
Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company,
or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussion or negotiation regarding a
Competing Proposal, including in each case the identity of the person making
any such Competing Proposal or indication, inquiry, offer or proposal, the
material terms of any such Competing Proposal or indication, inquiry, offer
or proposal and any material correspondence relating thereto. The Company
shall keep Buyer informed on a current basis of any material changes to the
terms of any such Competing Proposal or indication or inquiry. 

(g) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in this _Section 6.6_, and in
accordance with  _Section 6.6(e)_, if the Board of Directors of the Company
has effected a Permitted Change of Recommendation in compliance with the
requirements of _Section 6.6(e)(i)_ in response to a Superior Proposal (but
not an Alternate Superior Proposal) and is not in breach of _Section 6.6_,
then, prior to receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Board of
Directors of the Company (upon the recommendation of the Special Committee)
may cause the Company to enter into a binding written agreement (a "
_Superior Proposal Agreement_ ") to effect such Superior Proposal and
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(g)_.

 

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Board of Directors of the Company from (i) disclosing to the Companys
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if
the Board of Directors of the Company (or a committee thereof, as applicable)
has reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
and financial advisors, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
any applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) any disclosure of a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act other than a "stop, look and listen", an express rejection of any
applicable Competing Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the
Company Recommendation shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation and
(B) neither the Company nor the Companys Board of Directors (nor any
committee thereof) shall make any Change of Recommendation except in
accordance with the other provisions of this _Section 6.6_.

(i) As used in this Agreement:

 



62 (i) " _Competing Proposal_ " shall mean any proposal or offer from any person
or group other than Buyer and its Affiliates to effect: (A) any direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase, in any single transaction or series of
related transactions, by any such person or group of persons, of 15% or more
of the fair market value of the assets of the Post-Sale Company; (B) any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase by any person or group of persons
of 15% or more of the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries; (C) any tender offer or exchange offer (including
through the filing with the SEC of a Schedule TO), as defined pursuant to the
Exchange Act, that if consummated, would result in any person or group
beneficially owning 15% or more of the Company Common Stock or (D) any
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, issuance of or
amendment to the terms of outstanding stock or other securities, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company as a result of
which any person or group acting in concert would acquire assets or securities
described in clause (A), (B) or (C) above;

 

(ii) " _Company Intervening Event_ " means an event or circumstance material
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (other than any event
or circumstance resulting from a breach of this Agreement by the Company or
its Subsidiaries or any breach of any of the Related Transaction Agreements),
that was unknown to the Board of Directors of the Company on the date hereof,
which event or circumstance becomes known to the Board of Directors of the
Company prior to the Requisite Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (A) in no event shall the receipt, existence or terms of a Competing
Proposal (or any proposal or inquiry to acquire any of the FFELP Purchased
Assets or the CBNA Purchased Assets), or any inquiry or matter relating
thereto or consequence thereof, constitute a Company Intervening Event, (B)
in no event shall events or circumstances arising from the announcement or the
existence of, or any action taken by either party pursuant to and in
compliance with the terms of, this Agreement or the Related Transaction
Agreements constitute a Company Intervening Event and (C) in no event shall
any increase in the market price of the Company Common Stock, in and of
itself, constitute a Company Intervening Event ( _provided_ that the event or
circumstance underlying such increase in the market price of the Company
Common Stock shall not be excluded, and may be taken into account, in
determining whether there is a Company Intervening Event);

 

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any unsolicited, bona fide written
Competing Proposal (except the references in clauses (A), (B) and (C) thereof
to "15%" shall be replaced by "80%" and the reference in clause (A) thereof to
the "Post-Sale Company" shall be replaced by the "Company") that (A) is on
terms that the Board of Directors of the Company (upon the recommendation of
the Special Committee) determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside financial and legal advisors and consideration of all relevant
factors, would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more
favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of the Company Common
Stock than the Transactions (taking into account any binding proposal to amend
the terms of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and/or any of the
Related Transaction Agreements) and (B) is reasonably capable of being
completed on the terms set forth in the proposal within a reasonable period of
time, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects
thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, references to the

 



63  "Company" in this definition mean the Company, including the FFELP Purchased
Assets, the CBNA Purchased Assets and the Acquired Assets; and

 

(iv) " _Alternate Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any unsolicited, bona fide
written Competing Proposal (except the references in clauses (A), (B) and (C)
thereof to "15%" shall be replaced by "100%") that (A) is on terms that the
Board of Directors of the Company (upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee) determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
financial and legal advisors and consideration of all relevant factors, would,
if consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable from a
financial point of view to the holders of the Company Common Stock than the
Transactions (taking into account any binding proposal to amend the terms of
this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and/or any of the Related Transaction
Agreements), (B) is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms set
forth in the proposal within a reasonable period of time, taking into account
all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects thereof and (C) would, if
consummated, not result in (I) any person other than CBNA acquiring the CBNA
Purchased Assets in accordance with the terms and conditions of the CBNA
Transaction Agreement (as in effect immediately prior to the announcement of
or the Companys receipt of such Competing Proposal) and the
Transaction Documents (as defined in the CBNA Transaction Agreement) and (II)
any person other than FFELP Buyer Parent (and its Affiliates) acquiring the
FFELP Purchased Assets in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
FFELP Transaction Agreement (as in effect immediately prior to the Companys
receipt of such Competing Proposal) and the Transaction Documents (as defined
in the FFELP Transaction Agreement).

(j) During the period from the date of this Agreement through the earlier of
the Effective Time and the date of termination of this Agreement, the Company
shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any
confidentiality agreement relating to a Competing Proposal or standstill
agreement to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party
(other than any involving Buyer). During such period, the Company agrees
to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the
provisions of any such agreements, including obtaining injunctions to prevent
any breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions thereof in any court of the United States or any state thereof
having jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may waive any
such standstill if the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, determines that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the
Company to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

(k) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 8.1_, the Company agrees that it will comply with all
agreements and covenants to be performed by it under Section 10.4 of the FFELP
Transaction Agreement.

(l) Buyer agrees that neither it nor its Affiliates shall make any Competing
Proposal (as defined in the FFELP Transaction Agreement) without the prior
written consent of the Company or except as otherwise permitted through the
FFELP Transaction Agreement.

 



64 Section 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Buyer, and Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, (a) of
any event or matter that has caused any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements in this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement to be
inaccurate in any material respect ( _provided_ , that the failure to provide
such notice shall not in and of itself result in the failure of a closing
condition, it being understood and agreed that the underlying inaccuracy may
result in the failure of a closing condition), (b) of receipt of any notice
or other communication received by such party (or, in the case of the Company,
by the Depositor, any Securitization Trust or any Other Securitization Trust)
from any Governmental Authority, any party to a Securitization Basic Document
or an Other Securitization Basic Document, any holder of, or holder of a
beneficial interest in, any note issued under a Securitization Indenture or an
Other Securitization Indenture, any issuer of a Student Loan Insurance Policy
or any Rating Agency in connection with this Agreement, the Related
Transaction Agreements or the Transactions, or from any person alleging that
the consent of such person is or may be required in connection herewith or
therewith, and (c) upon becoming aware of any Proceedings commenced or, to
such partys knowledge, threatened against or involving such party or any of
its Subsidiaries which relate thereto. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Company shall give prompt notice to Buyer, upon becoming aware of (i) any
default or breach or failure to perform any obligation by any party to a
Securitization Basic Document or Other Securitization Basic Document or (ii)
receipt by it or by the Depositor, any Securitization Trust or any Other
Securitization Trust of any written notice or communication from any person
asserting the same.

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. The initial press releases with respect to
the Transactions shall be press releases mutually agreed upon by Buyer, the
Company, CBNA and FFELP Buyer Parent. Buyer and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing any other press release or otherwise making any
public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Merger (and none of
Buyer or its Affiliates shall issue or make any other press release with
respect to the Related Transactions) and shall not issue any such press
release without the prior consent of the other (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), except as may be required by
Law or any listing agreement with the NYSE to which Buyer or the Company is a
party.

Section 6.9 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) On or before the Closing, but effective as of the Closing Date (or January
1, 2011 in the event the Closing Date occurs prior to December 31, 2010), the
Company shall take, or shall use reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates,
as applicable, to take, all actions necessary, if any, to cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to cease to be adopting or participating employers under
all Benefit Plans that are not Company Benefit Plans and each Company Employee
shall cease to accrue benefits under the Benefit Plans that are not Company
Benefit Plans.

 

(b) The employment of each person employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries
as of the Closing Date (for the avoidance of doubt, after giving effect to
the Related Transactions and _Section 6.1_) (the " _Company Employees_ ")
shall automatically be continued on the Closing Date.

 



65 (c) Except as otherwise provided in the Separation Agreement with respect to
severance benefits and transition services with respect to human resources
and employee benefit plans and programs, for the period commencing on the
Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer
shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, provide Company Employees
with compensation and employee benefit plans, programs, policies and
arrangements that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the
compensation and employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements
provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates. In
addition, for the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, unless agreed upon by such Company
Employee, Buyer shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to,
increase any Company Employees commute as of immediately prior to the Closing
Date by thirty (30) or more miles one way.

 

(d) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending six (6) months
following the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide to each Company Employee base wages or salaries, as applicable, that
are no less favorable than the base wages or salaries provided to each such
Company Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Closing Date. In addition, on and following the Closing Date (or January
1, 2011 in the event the Closing Date occurs prior to December 31, 2010),
Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, cause each compensation or
employee benefit plan, program, or arrangement maintained or contributed to
by Buyer or any of its Affiliates and in which any Company Employee becomes
eligible to participate, to treat the prior service of such Company Employee
with the Company or any of its Affiliates, as the case may be, as service
rendered to Buyer or its Affiliates, as the case may be, for all purposes
(including vesting, eligibility, level of benefit (including for purposes of
severance and vacation/paid time off benefits) and benefit accrual purposes);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to
benefit accruals under any defined benefit plan; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Company Employees years of service with the Company and its
Affiliates and their respective predecessors before the Closing Date shall be
not included for purposes of determining whether a Company Employee is
eligible for subsidized retiree medical benefits.

 

(e) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) waive any limitation on
health and welfare coverage of any Company Employee due to pre-existing
conditions and/or waiting periods, active employment requirements, and
requirements to show evidence of good health under the applicable health and
welfare plan of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer to the extent such
Company Employee is currently covered under a health and welfare benefit plan
of the Company or any of its Affiliates (as the case may be) and (ii) in the
event the Closing Date occurs after January 1, 2011, credit each Company
Employee with all deductible payments, co-payments and co-insurance paid by
such employee and covered dependents under the group health plan of the
Company or any of its Affiliates (as the case may be) prior to the Closing
Date during the year in which the Closing Date occurs for the purpose of
determining the extent to which any such employee and his or her dependents
have satisfied their deductible and whether they have reached the out-of-
pocket maximum under any medical plan of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer for
such year.

(f) Effective as of the Closing Date (if the Closing Date occurs after
December 31, 2010), Buyer shall (i) permit, or shall cause its Affiliates to
permit, Company Employees to participate in flexible spending reimbursement
accounts under a cafeteria plan

 



66  qualifying under Section 125 of the Code (the " _Buyer FSA_ ") to the extent
coverage under such Buyer FSA replaces coverage under a comparable Benefit
Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the
Closing Date (the " _CBNA FSA_ "), (ii) credit Company Employees under the
Buyer FSA immediately following the Closing Date with amounts available for
reimbursement equal to such amounts as were credited under the CBNA FSA with
respect to such person immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) give
effect under the Buyer FSA to any elections made by such Company Employees
with respect to the CBNA FSA for the plan year in which the Closing Date
falls.

(g) In the event that a Company Employee makes a voluntary election pursuant
to Section 401(a)(31) of the Code to roll over his or her account balance in
the Citigroup 401(k) Plan to a tax-qualified defined contribution plan
sponsored by Buyer, Buyer agrees to cause such tax-qualified defined
contribution plan to accept such rollover, subject to the terms of the
Buyers tax-qualified defined contribution plan.

(h) Effective as of January 1, 2011 (if the Closing Date occurs prior to
December 31, 2010) or effective as of the Closing Date (if the Closing Date
occurs on or after January 1, 2011), Buyer shall credit each Company Employee
with the number of unused planned time off days earned by and credited to
such Company Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing Date in
accordance with the policy of the Company immediately prior to the Closing
Date. For the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide Company Employees with
planned and unplanned time-off policies that are no less favorable than the
planned and unplanned time-off policies provided to similarly
situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the number of unused planned time-off days that may be carried over from 2010
to 2011 shall be limited by the time-off policies as in effect with respect to
the Company Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided
further_ that any unused planned time-off days that are carried over from 2010
to 2011 must be used before any planned time-off days earned in 2011 may be
used. For the avoidance of doubt, the number of unused planned time-off days
and unplanned time-off days that may be carried over from 2011 to 2012 shall
be limited by the planned and unplanned time-off policies of similarly
situated employees of the Buyer and its Affiliates. 

(i) Without limiting the generality of _Section 9.5_, the provisions of this
_Section 6.9_ are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and
nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to
confer upon or give to any person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Company Employee or former employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
(with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section 6.9_) under or by
reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 6.9_
shall amend, or be deemed to amend (or prevent the amendment or termination
of) any Benefit Plan or any compensation or benefit plan of the Company or
its Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section 6.9_ shall create any obligation on
the part of Buyer (or the Company, as applicable) to continue the employment
of a Company Employee or any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries for
any definite period of time following the Effective Time.

 



67 Section 6.10 _Acquisition Sub_. Buyer will take all actions necessary to (a)
cause Acquisition Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
and (b) ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Acquisition Sub shall not
conduct any business or make any investments other than in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or incur or guarantee any
indebtedness.

Section 6.11 _Related Transaction Agreements_.

(a) Without the prior written consent of Buyer, the Company shall not (i)
amend, modify or waive any provision of the Related Transaction Agreements or
the Ancillary Agreements (or the forms thereof or term sheets relating
thereto) in a manner that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
Buyers, the Companys or any of their respective Subsidiaries rights and
obligations under, or materially impair the ability of Buyer, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to perform any of their obligations
under, this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Related Transaction
Agreements or materially delay the Closing Date or (ii) terminate the FFELP
Transaction Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(a) of such agreement or the
CBNA Transaction Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(a) of such agreement.
Subject to the foregoing, the Company shall deliver promptly (and in any event
not later than five Business Days prior to the proposed effective
date thereof) to Buyer copies of all proposed amendments, modifications and
waivers to any Related Transaction Agreement or Ancillary Agreement. The
Company shall comply in all material respects with all agreements and
covenants required to be performed by it under the Related Transaction
Agreements and the Ancillary Agreements on or prior to the Closing Date. The
Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to enforce, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of each Related
Transaction Agreement and Ancillary Agreement, including obtaining injunctions
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any court of the
United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction.

 

(b) The Company shall keep Buyer informed on a reasonably current basis of any
material changes in or developments with respect to the Related Transactions,
including delivering to Buyer copies of all notices the Company receives under
the Related Transaction Agreements, and, subject to applicable Laws, shall
furnish promptly to Buyer such information concerning the status of and the
progress towards closing the Related Transactions as Buyer or its
Representatives may reasonably request. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Company shall give prompt notice to Buyer of any event or matter that it
becomes aware of that would be reasonably likely to result in the failure of
any condition in any Related Transaction Agreement to be satisfied.

Section 6.12 _Certain Ancillary Agreements_.

(a) Each of the Company and Buyer agree that it will, and cause its Affiliates
and Subsidiaries to, negotiate in good faith definitive versions of the
Transition Agreements in a manner consistent with, and containing the terms
set forth in, the term sheet attached hereto as _Exhibits G_ and on other
customary terms to which the parties may agree, for execution by the Company
and Buyer, their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries on the Closing Date.

 



68 (b) At the Closing, each of the Company and Buyer shall, and shall cause their
applicable Affiliates to, execute and deliver the Subservicing Letter
Agreement, the Transition Agreements and each other Ancillary Agreement to be
executed and delivered by such party or its Affiliates.

 

Section 6.13 _Agreements with Other Parties_. Without the prior written
consent of the Company (upon the recommendation of the Special Committee),
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, enter into any agreements,
arrangements or understandings (other than as provided in this Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreements and the Related Transaction Agreements) between
Buyer or its Affiliates and either (i) FFELP Buyer Parent or its Affiliates
with respect to the Transactions or (ii) CBNA or its Affiliates with respect
to the Transactions that would have the effect of providing additional
consideration in excess of the Merger Consideration provided to CBNA pursuant
to this Agreement.

Section 6.14 _FIRPTA Certificate_. The Company shall deliver to Buyer at
Closing a duly executed certificate that the Company does not constitute a
"United States real property holding corporation" (as defined in section 897
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder) in the form
and manner required under section 1.1445-2(c)(3) of the Treasury Regulations;
_provided_ , _however_ , if the Company fails to deliver such a certificate
or Buyer has actual knowledge that such statement is false (or has received a
notice that the statement is false) pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-4, Buyer shall be entitled to withhold pursuant to Section 1445 of the
Code from amounts payable under this Agreement.

not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect
or materially impair the ability of the Company to perform its obligations
under this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Related
Transaction Agreements; (ii) the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in the second and last sentences in _Section 4.3(a)_, the

or any of their respective Subsidiaries rights and obligations under this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Related Transaction Agreements
effected without the prior written consent of Buyer;

 

(f) all of the Ancillary Agreements and all of the Related Transaction
Agreements shall have been duly executed and delivered by each party thereto,
each such agreement shall be in full force and effect, and no event shall have
occurred and no condition or state of facts shall exist that has caused or
would reasonably be expected to cause any such agreement not to be in full
force and effect or that has materially impaired or would reasonably be
expected to materially impair the ability of any party to perform its
obligations thereunder; and

(g) the Company shall have delivered to Buyer a certificate, dated the

limitation as to materiality set forth therein) at and as of the Effective
Time with the same force and effect as if made at and as of the Effective Time
(other than those representations and warranties that address matters only as
of a particular date or only with respect to a specific period of time, which
need only be true and correct as of such date or with respect to such period),

to prevent or materially delay or materially impair the ability of Buyer or
any of its Subsidiaries to consummate any of the Transactions;

 

(b) Buyer and Acquisition Sub shall have performed and complied in all
material respects with all material agreements and covenants required by this

71 ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

Section 8.1 _Termination_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may
be abandoned, at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
the Requisite Stockholder Approval, as follows: 

(a) by mutual written consent of each of Buyer and the Company;

 

(b) by written notice of either Buyer or the Company, if (i) the Merger has
not been consummated on or before March 31, 2011 (the " _Termination Date_
"); and (ii) the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(b)_ shall not have breached in any material respect its
obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have proximately
caused the failure to consummate the Merger on or before such date; _provided_
that, if as of the Termination Date, (A) all of the conditions to this
Agreement (other than those that are to be satisfied by action taken at the
Closing) shall have been satisfied or waived other than the conditions set
forth in (x) _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(c)_, or (y) _Section
7.1(d)_ or _Section 7.1(e)_ (to the extent resulting from the failure to
obtain regulatory approvals), or (B) the "Termination Date" (as defined in the
FFELP Transaction Agreement or the CBNA Transaction Agreement, as applicable)
has been extended, then the Termination Date shall be automatically extended
to April 30, 2011 or such date as the Termination Date (as defined in the
FFELP Transaction Agreement or the CBNA Transaction Agreement) has been
extended;

 

(c) by written notice of either Buyer or the Company, if any Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an Order or taken any
other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such Order or other action
shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ that the party
seeking to terminate this agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)_ shall
have complied in all material respects with its obligations under _Section
6.4_ hereof;

(d) by written notice of either Buyer or the Company, if the Requisite
Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at a duly held Stockholders
Meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof at which a quorum
is present and the votes to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger are
taken);

 

(e) by written notice from the Company to Buyer, if Buyer shall have breached
or failed to perform in any material respect any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement, which
breach or failure to perform (1) would result in a failure of a condition set
forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ and (2) cannot be cured by
the Termination Date; _provided_ that the Company shall have given Buyer
written notice, delivered at least forty-five (45) days prior to such
termination, stating the Companys intention to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_ and the basis for such termination;

 



72 (f) by written notice from Buyer to the Company, if the Company shall have
breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (1) would result in a failure of
a condition set forth in  _Section 7.2(a) _or _Section 7.2(b)_ and (2)
cannot be cured by the Termination Date; _provided_ that Buyer shall have
given the Company written notice, delivered at least forty-five (45) days
prior to such termination, stating Buyers intention to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(f)_ and the basis for such
termination;

(g) by written notice from the Company (upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee) to Buyer, simultaneously with the Company or its Subsidiaries
entering into a Superior Proposal Agreement in accordance with _Section
6.6(g)_;

(h) by written notice from either Buyer or the Company, if either the
FFELP Transaction Agreement or the CBNA Transaction Agreement has been
terminated; or

(i) by written notice from Buyer if the Company effects a Change of
Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal.

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect without
liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee,
agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other party hereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , no party to this Agreement shall be relieved or
released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its knowing and
intentional breach of its obligations under this Agreement. For purposes of
this Agreement, "knowing and intentional breach" means an act or failure to
act which constitutes a breach of this Agreement with respect to which the
breaching party has knowledge (actual or constructive) that such act
or failure to act would or would reasonably be expected to breach its
obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
provisions of this _Article VIII_ , _Article IX_ , and the Confidentiality
Agreement referred to in  _Section 6.5_ shall survive any termination hereof
pursuant to _Section 8.1_.

Section 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) If (i) prior to the termination of this Agreement, a Qualifying
Transaction is proposed or publicly disclosed, (ii) this Agreement is
terminated by Buyer or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ and (iii)
concurrently with, or within twelve (12) months after any such termination,
any Qualifying Transaction is consummated or the Company or any of its
Affiliates enters into any letter of intent, agreement in principle or
Contract with respect to a Qualifying Transaction, then the Company shall pay
to Buyer a fee of $24,000,000 in cash, such payment to be made upon the
earlier of entry into the letter of intent, agreement in principle or Contract
with respect to such Qualifying Transaction or the consummation of such
Qualifying Transaction; _provided_ , that if at the time of such payment
the FFELP Buyer Parent is entitled to a payment from the Company pursuant to
Section 11.3(a) of the FFELP Transaction Agreement, then the Company shall pay
to Buyer a fee of $12,000,000 in cash.

 



73 (b) If (i) prior to the termination of this Agreement, an Alternate Superior
Proposal is proposed or publicly disclosed and (ii) this Agreement is
terminated by Buyer or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ or _Section
8.1(d)_, then the Company shall pay to Buyer a fee of $24,000,000 in cash,
such payment to be made promptly upon termination of this Agreement and in
any event within two (2) Business Days after the termination of this
Agreement.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(g)_, then the Company shall pay to Buyer a fee of $12,000,000 in cash,
such payment to be made concurrently with such termination.

(d) If this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to _Section 8.1(i)_,
then the Company shall pay to Buyer a fee of $12,000,000 in cash, such
payment to be made promptly upon termination of this Agreement and in any
event within two (2) Business Days after the termination of this Agreement.

 

(e) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Buyer (i) pursuant to
_Section 8.1(h)_ and, prior thereto, the FFELP Transaction Agreement was
terminated by the FFELP Buyer Parent pursuant to Section 11.1(e) or Section
11.1(g) of the FFELP Transaction Agreement or (ii) pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)_ and there had previously occurred a willful breach by the Company of
the FFELP Transaction Agreement, then the Company shall pay Buyer a fee of
$24,000,000 in cash, such payment to be made no later than two (2) Business
Days after the date of termination of this Agreement. In the event that Buyer
receives the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.3(e)_, the
receipt of such fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by Buyer or Acquisition Sub
in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof); _provided_ ,
that nothing in this _Section 8.3(e)_ shall prohibit any payment required to
be made pursuant to _Section 8.3(f)_.

 

(f) Unless a Company Termination Fee is payable under _Section 8.3(e)_, if
this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Buyer pursuant to (i)
_Section 8.1(b)_ and at the time of such termination the only conditions that
were not satisfied were _Section 7.1(d)_, _Section 7.1(e)_, _Section
7.2(c)_ and any other conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied
at the Closing or (ii) _Section 8.1(h)_, then the Company shall reimburse
Buyer upon demand by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account specified in writing by Buyer for an amount equal to 120% of the
aggregate amount of Transaction Expenses of Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall not be obligated to make a payment pursuant to this
_Section 8.3(f)_ in excess of $4,000,000 in the aggregate. 

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall the Company be required to pay a Company Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 8.3(a)_, _8.3(b)_ , _8.3(c)_ , _8.3(d)_ or _8.3(e)_ on more than one
occasion. Any such payment shall be reduced by any amounts as may be required
to be deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Tax Law, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that prior to or on the date of the Company making any such
withholding, (i) the Company shall notify Buyer as soon as reasonably
practicable after notice of termination of this Agreement or entry into a
Superior Proposal Agreement, as applicable, that such withholding is required,
(ii) the Company and Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to

 



74  minimize any withholding Taxes and (iii) Buyer may deliver to the Company
such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable
Law as would permit such payment to be made without withholding or at a
reduced rate of withholding. Buyer and the Company each acknowledge that under
current Law, no U.S. federal withholding Tax would be required with respect to
the Company Termination Fee.

 

(h) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the Company Termination Fee
and the other provisions of this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without the Company
Transaction Fee and such other provisions, Buyer would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amounts
due pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_, _8.3(b)_ , _8.3(c)_ , _8.3(d)_ , _8.3(e)_
or _8.3(f)_ and, in order to obtain such payment Buyer commences a suit which
results in a judgment against the Company for any of the amounts set forth in
_Section 8.3(a)_, _8.3(b)_ , _8.3(c)_ , _8.3(d)_ , _8.3(e)_ or _8.3(f)_ ,
then the Company shall pay to Buyer its costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on all
amounts due pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_, _8.3(b)_ , _8.3(c)_ , _8.3(d)_ ,
_8.3(e)_ or _8.3(f)_ at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date
plus 2% per annum from the date such amounts were required to be paid until
the date actually received by Buyer.

(i) Subject to the foregoing, all expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by
the party incurring such expenses, except that the Company shall pay, whether
or not the Merger or any other transaction is consummated, all expenses
incurred in connection with (i) printing, filing and mailing the Proxy
Statement and all SEC and other regulatory filing fees incurred in connection
with the Proxy Statement, (ii) any filing with antitrust authorities
and (iii) the Paying Agent. Any Company Termination Fee required to be paid
pursuant hereto shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account specified in writing by Buyer.

 

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of
the parties hereto at any time prior to the Effective Time (in the case of
the Company, by the Board of Directors (upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee)); _provided_ , _however_ , that, after the adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Merger by stockholders of the Company, there
shall not be any amendment that by Law or in accordance with the rules of the
NYSE requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such
further approval of such stockholders nor any amendment or change not
permitted under applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

Section 8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject to
applicable Law, any party (in the case of the Company, by the Board of
Directors (upon the recommendation of the Special Committee)) hereto may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of any
other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) subject to the proviso of _Section 8.4_, waive
compliance with any agreement or condition contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall only be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Buyer or Acquisition Sub in

 



75  exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder.

Section 9.2 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_. When a reference is made in
this Agreement to an Article, Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to
an Article or Section

 



77  of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table
of contents and headings for this Agreement are for reference purposes only
and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of
similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined
in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any
certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to
the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any
statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that
is referred to herein means such statute as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by succession of
comparable successor statutes, and any rules, regulations or guidelines issued
or promulgated thereunder. Other than in _Section 9.4_, references to a
person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. In the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall
be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 9.3 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner materially adverse to
any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible.

Section 9.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto.

 

Section 9.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the exhibits and schedules hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements constitute the entire agreement, and supersede
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between
the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each party hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns,
and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; _provided_ that, from and
after the Effective Time, the Companys stockholders shall be third party
beneficiaries of the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Article III_.

Section 9.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of
action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out or
relate to this Agreement

 



78  or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including
any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as
an inducement to enter into this Agreement) shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any otherwise applicable choice or conflict of laws provision or
rule.

Section 9.7 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Each of Buyer, Acquisition Sub and the Company hereby irrevocably submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Chancery Court, or if such
court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal or other state court of the
State of Delaware, for the purpose of any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement and each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect to such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined exclusively in any such court. Each of
Buyer, Acquisition Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

(b) Each of Buyer, Acquisition Sub and the Company irrevocably consents to
the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in any other
action or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, on behalf of itself or its property, by personal delivery of
copies of such process to such party. Nothing in this _Section 9.7_ shall
affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by Law.

 

Section 9.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission) in two (2) or more counterparts, and by
the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 

Section 9.9 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF BUYER, ACQUISITION SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER, THE OTHER
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF BUYER OR THE COMPANY IN
THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

Section 9.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereby expressly acknowledge
and agree that immediate, extensive and irreparable damage would result, no
adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine
in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or otherwise breached. Therefore, in
addition to, and not in limitation of, any other remedy available to any
party, an aggrieved party under this Agreement would be entitled to specific
performance of the terms hereof and immediate injunctive relief, without the
necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy. Such
remedies, and any and all other remedies provided for in this Agreement,
shall, however, be cumulative in nature and not exclusive and shall be in
addition to

 



79  any other remedies whatsoever which any party may otherwise have. Each of
the parties hereby acknowledges and agrees that it may be difficult to prove
damages with reasonable certainty, that it may be difficult to procure
suitable substitute performance, and that injunctive relief and/or specific
performance will not cause an undue hardship to the parties. Each of the
parties hereby further acknowledges that the existence of any other remedy
contemplated by this Agreement does not diminish the availability of specific
performance of the obligations hereunder or any other injunctive relief.

[REMAINDER OF PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]

Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their
respective officers thereunto duly authorized.

continuing security interest (as defined in the applicable Uniform Commercial
Code) in the Trust Student Loans sold thereunder in favor of the Depositor,
