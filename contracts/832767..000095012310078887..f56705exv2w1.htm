AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of August 17, 2010 by and among Pharaoh Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Pharaoh Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Subsidiary_ "), and Phoenix Technologies Ltd., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Marlin Equity II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" _Marlin II_ "), and Marlin Equity III, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" _Marlin III_ "), are also executing this agreement solely for the purpose of agreeing to Section 10.14 hereof and shall be considered to be parties to this Agreement solely for the purpose of such section. 

  

 WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (" _DGCL_ "), Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company will enter into a business combination transaction pursuant to which Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, (i) determined that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are in the best interests of the stockholders of the Company, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, in accordance with the DGCL, and (iii) determined to recommend that the Companys stockholders adopt this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Merger Subsidiary has, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and Parent (as the sole stockholder of Merger Subsidiary) has adopted this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL; 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to the willingness of the Parent and Merger Subsidiary to enter into this Agreement, Ramius LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Voting Stockholder_ "), has executed and delivered a voting agreement pursuant to which the Voting Stockholder agrees to vote in favor of the Merger, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (together with an irrevocable proxy in favor of Parent); and 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition of the willingness of the Company to enter into this Agreement, Marlin II and Marlin III (collectively, the " _Equity Providers_ ") are providing an Equity Funding Letter (as defined below), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE 1 
 The Merger 

   

 Section 1.01. _The Closing._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., San Francisco time, as soon as practicable (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days) after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth in Article 8 (excluding conditions that, by their terms, are satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions), unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP, Two Palo Alto Square, 3000 El Camino Real, Palo Alto, California 94306, unless another place is agreed to by the parties hereto. 

  

 Section 1.02. _The Merger._ (a) As soon as practicable after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as is specified in the Certificate of Merger and as is agreed to by the parties hereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ") and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger. 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the properties, rights, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under the DGCL. 

  

 Section 1.03. _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof: 

  

 (a) except as otherwise provided in Sections 1.03(b) or 1.05, each share (" _Company Share_ ") of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and represent the right to receive $3.85 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "); 

  

 (b) each Company Share held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, returned and cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; and 

  

 (c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation 

   ##### 

  

 

with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and
shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation. 

   

 Section 1.04. _Surrender and Payment._ (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing Company Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") and (ii) uncertificated Company Shares (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "). Parent shall pay to the Exchange Agent, on the Closing Date and prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time and, in any event, not later than the third Business Day following the Closing Date, Parent shall send, or shall instruct the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder of Company Shares at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. 

  

 (b) Each holder of Company Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. 

  

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (d) The payment of the Merger Consideration upon the surrender of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been payment in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Shares on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 1. 

  

 (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration paid to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 1.04(a) (and any interest or other income earned thereon) that remains unclaimed by holders of Company Shares one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon 

   ##### 

  

 

demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged such Company Shares for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 1.04 prior to that time
shall thereafter look only to Parent only as general creditors thereof with
respect to any Merger Consideration in respect of such Company Shares without
any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be
liable to any holder of Company Shares for any amounts paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Shares for two (2)
years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to
such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (f) To the extent that Parent or the Company makes any payment in respect of any Appraisal Shares, a portion of the Merger Consideration made available to Exchange Agent in respect of such Appraisal Shares shall be returned to Parent. 

  

 Section 1.05. _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who (i) has not voted such shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the Merger at the Stockholder Meeting, (ii) is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") and complies in all respects with the provisions of Section 262, and (iii) has not effectively withdrawn, forfeited or otherwise lost the right to demand relief as a dissenting stockholder under the DGCL as of the Effective Time (the " _Appraisal Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.03(a), but instead such holder of Appraisal Shares shall only be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist or be outstanding, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except such rights as are granted under Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the rights of such holder under Section 262 shall cease to exist and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive such holders Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.03(a). The Company shall provide prompt written notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

  

 Section 1.06. _Company Stock Options; Company Restricted Stock Awards._  

  

 (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt 

   ##### 

  

 

such resolutions and take such other actions (including adopting any plan
amendments) as are required to provide that, except as otherwise agreed
between Parent and any holder thereof: (i) each then outstanding Company
Stock Option granted under any Company Stock Plan shall, immediately prior
to the Closing Date, vest in full and become exercisable for all the shares
of Company Common Stock at the time subject to such option as fully-vested
shares of Company Common Stock and each then outstanding Company Restricted
Stock Award shall vest in full immediately prior to the Closing Date; (ii)
each then-outstanding Company Stock Option as so fully vested and exercisable
shall be either, to the extent permitted under the Company Stock Plans
or otherwise agreed with the holder, cancelled immediately prior to the
Effective Time in exchange for payment of an amount in cash equal to the
product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B)
the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise
price of such Company Stock Option (for the avoidance of doubt, each holder
of a Company Stock Option with a per share exercise price that is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration shall not be entitled to receive any
payment with respect to such Company Stock Options) or, where such a
cancellation in return for cash is not permitted under the Company Stock
Plans or otherwise agreed with the holder, shall be exercised immediately
prior to the Closing Date and each share of Company Common Stock issued as
a result of any such exercise shall be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in the manner provided in Section 1.03; and each
Company Stock Option not cashed-out or exercised in accordance with the
foregoing shall be cancelled at the Effective Time; and (iii) each then-
outstanding Company Restricted Stock Award as so fully vested in accordance
herewith shall be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time in
exchange for payment of an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted
Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) the Merger
Consideration. All such cash payments to be paid pursuant to the immediately
preceding clauses (ii) and (iii) shall be referred to herein as the " _Equity
Incentive Amounts_ ". Any Equity Incentive Amounts shall be paid by the
Surviving Corporation promptly following the Effective Time through the
payroll of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with paragraph (b) below,
but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) Parent will take all actions necessary so that, at or within ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Time, upon delivery of a duly executed and completed letter of transmittal, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company (the " _Option Letter of Transmittal_ "), to the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid to each holder of Company Restricted Stock Awards and Company Stock Options granted under the Company Stock Plan any Equity Incentive Amounts to which such holder is entitled as determined in accordance with Section 1.06(a) through the Surviving Corporations payroll less any Taxes which such company must withhold or is liable to pay to any Tax authority, unless alternative arrangements are specified by such holder in the Option Letter of Transmittal, to the extent permitted thereby. In the event that the Surviving Corporation has insufficient cash to make such payment to each holder of Company Restricted Stock Awards and Company Stock Options, Parent shall pay such amounts or provide to the Surviving Corporation sufficient cash to pay such amounts within the time period specified herein. 

  

 Section 1.07. _Adjustments._ If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall 

   ##### 

  

 

occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split (including reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, but excluding any change in the number of outstanding
Company Shares that results from any exercise of Company Stock Options
outstanding as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration and any other

   ##### 

  

 

Agreement and the Equity Financing commitment as would permit the Company or
the Board of Directors not to take such actions; and (iii) the Board of
Directors shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement
and the Equity Financing commitment that may be offered in writing by Parent
by 11:59 PM Pacific Time on the 3rd Business Day of such 3 Business Day
period in a manner that would form a binding contract (including the complete
form of definitive acquisition agreement executed on behalf of Parent and all
exhibits and other attachments thereto, and subject only to acceptance by the
Company by countersignature on behalf of the Company and those conditions set
forth therein) if accepted by the Company and shall have determined in good
faith after consultation with outside counsel and independent
financial advisors that the Acquisition Proposal received by the Company
would continue to constitute, or would result in, a Superior Proposal if such
changes offered in writing by Parent were given effect. In the event of any
material revisions to the Superior Proposal (it being agreed that material
revisions shall include any change in the purchase price, form of
consideration, transaction timing, transaction financing or transaction
structure for such Superior Proposal), the Company shall be required to
deliver a new written notice to Parent pursuant to the foregoing clause (i)

For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines (after consultation with its outside counsel and independent financial advisor) are more favorable to the Companys stockholders from the financial point of view, taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (including the likelihood and timing of consummation thereof) and this Agreement (including any changes in the terms of this Agreement committed to by the Parent to the Company in writing in response to such Acquisition Proposal or otherwise), except that the references to "15%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "50%". 

  

 (g) Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Companys Board of Directors failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under Applicable Law; provided, however, that neither the Board of

Directors nor any committee thereof shall recommend that the stockholders of
the Company tender their shares in connection with any tender or exchange
offer (or otherwise approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal) unless the

Agreement, (i) a factually accurate public statement by the Company that
describes the Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation
of this Agreement with respect thereto, shall not be deemed a withdrawal or

Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay any amount due to Parent pursuant to this Section 9.02, when due, the Company shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with any action taken to collect payment (including the prosecution of any lawsuit or other legal action), together with interest on the unpaid amount at the publicly announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in New York City from the date such amount was first payable to the date it is paid. Each of the parties hereto further acknowledges that the payment of the Company Termination Fee by the Company is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such fee is payable and which do not involve fraud or a Willful Breach as described in this Section 9.02 for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event the Company Termination Fee is payable to Parent, payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and each of their respective Affiliates against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future stockholders, managers, employees, representatives, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, except in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach as described in this Section 9.02.
